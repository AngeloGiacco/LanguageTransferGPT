Swahili Track 02
Teacher: We're going to break down Swahili and language generally to see how we use it to express
  ideas. How we convert ideas into language. So, the first thing we can say about languages
  generally is that they have words and also that they have different types of words. And these
  different types of words behave in different ways. For example, we have verbs. In English, these
  are two words; so: to come, to want, to be in the standard form. You know? Whether we can
  put to, t-o, in front of to eat, to sleep… In Swahili verbs don't have to in front of them but ku.
  Ku, which is k-u. So, where in English, we have to sleep and that's two words, in Swahili, we
  have one word and that's kulala. So, kulala is to sleep.
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: And the word is probably echoic which just means it's like an echo of the action of the verb. So,
  kulala maybe it comes from singing somebody to sleep, like lullaby, which is also an echoic,
  no? Lalala or too low. There we have kulala, to sleep.
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: And we have the accent on the penultimate syllable, on the second last syllable, no? That's
  where the stress fallStudent: kulala.
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: And if we get rid of one of those las how is this going to sound?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula, good, you put the accent again on the second last syllable, kula; and that means to eat by
  coincidence. So, already we have two verbs in Swahili. What is to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: And to eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Very good. So, these are verbs once we put to in front of. But of course, verbs aren't just the to
  forms, no? We don't just say to sleep but I sleep, he sleeps, I slept and all of this we get from to
  sleep. In Swahili to get these different meanings out of a true form the first thing we do is the
  same as what we do in English is to lose the to, no? Before we say I sleep we get rid of the to
  of to sleep. So, if kulala is to sleep, what is the bit that represents to?
Student: Ku.
Teacher: Good. So, if you get rid of it, what do we left with?
Student: Lala.
Teacher: Lala. So, we left with lala. Now to show I sleep or I'm sleeping we will add on to the beginning
  of lala to give that information. And to say I sleep or I'm sleeping we need to add on two pieces
  of information. We need to add on the information of I and we need to add on the information
  of the present; that we are in the present tense. That is I am sleeping rather than I slept or will
  sleep. The sound for I in Swahili is ni.
 
Student: Ni.
Teacher: And the sound for the present is na.
Student: Na.
Teacher: Now put those two sounds together. What will it sound like?
Student: Nina.
Teacher: Nina. So, to say I in the present we have nina and we add that on to our verb without the ku.
  So, let's run through this again from the beginning with to sleep. What is to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: Kulala. And just sleep without the to?
Student: Lala.
Teacher: Lala. And then, if we add on to the beginning our sound for I which is?
Student: Nina.
Teacher: The sound for I: ni.
Student: Ni.
Teacher: Ni. And the sound for present?
Student: Na.
Teacher: So, you are raring to tell me: I sleep or I'm sleeping.
Student: Ninalala.
Teacher: Very good. Ninalala, no? So, this means I sleep or I'm sleeping. Kucheka means to laugh.
  Kucheka.
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Again, an echoic verb, no? The sound of cheka is coming from the sound it makes to laugh like
  to chuckle, no? To chuckle in English, again, it's an echoic. The idea is that the sound that you
  make is something like hehehe, no? Chuckle. So, kucheka; to laugh. And that's k-u-c-h-e-k-a.
  And Swahili is written in this Latin alphabet; in the same alphabet as English. And then Swahili

  used to be written in Arabic script actually, but nowadays in the Latin script that we use in
  English. So, that's kucheka; to laugh.
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Which bit of kucheka means to?
Student: Ku.
Teacher: And which bit of kucheka means laugh?
Student: Cheka.
Teacher: Good. Ku, to and cheka, laugh. Kucheka, to laugh. So, if you want to build: I laugh or I'm
  laughing, what is the first thing we do?
Student: We get rid of the: to, ku.
Teacher: Good. The to or the ku, no? And we’re left with?
Student: Cheka.
Teacher: Cheka. And then we need to put two sounds. We need to give two pieces of information: the
  information of I and the information of present.
Student: Ninacheka.
Teacher: Ninacheka. Very good. So, ni is for I, na is for present and then cheka. Ninacheka. All one
  word and that means I laugh or I'm laughing. To want is kutaka. Kutaka.
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: That's k-u-t-a-k-a. Kutaka.
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: So, which bit there carries the meaning of want?
Student: Taka.
Teacher: Taka. Very good. So, how do we get I want from to want?
Student: We get rid of the ku, so we have taka and then ninataka.
   
Teacher: Very good. Ninataka, no? I want, ninataka. So, ni shows it’s I, na shows it’s present and taka
  gives us our meaning of want. Ninataka. What was to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: Kulala. So, how would you say I want to sleep?
Student: Ninataka kulala.
Teacher: Very good. Ninataka kulala. And what was to eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula. I want to eat.
Student: Ninataka kula.
Teacher: Ninataka kula. Very good. The word for now. Now in Swahili is sasa.
Student: Sasa.
Teacher: Sasa. S-a-s-a, and that's a repeated syllable, no? Sasa. And that happens very often in Swahili.
  In fact, we've already seen an example of it. What was to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: Kulala. So, lala of kulala again is a repeated syllable. That happens quite often in Swahili. So,
  we have sasa for now. How would you say I want to sleep now?
Student: Ninataka kulala sasa.
Teacher: Very good. Ninataka kulala sasa. I want to eat now.
Student: Ninataka kula sasa.
Teacher: Ninataka kula sasa. Very good. You might also hear in some dialects of Swahili sasa as a
  greeting; an informal greeting. You know, like hey; sasa.
Swahili Track 03
Teacher: So, we know four verbs already in Swahili. What was to sleep? Which was an echoic; a bit like
  lullaby.
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: Kulala. And we get rid of one of the las and we have to eat.
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula. To laugh, which was also an echoic, sounds a little bit like chuckle.
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. And to want to? Do you remember?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. Good. So, apart from all beginning ku, we also notice the ending in a, no? Kulala,
  kula, kucheka, kutaka. And we saw how Swahili verbs work, no? We start without to
  something with ku and we take off that ku and we add bits on to the beginning to give the
  information that we want. So, for example the sound for I was?
Student: Ni.
Teacher: Good. And the sound for the present?
Student: Na.
Teacher: Na. So, I in the present?
Student: Nina.
Teacher: Nina. Give me again to want.
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. And I want?
Student: Ninataka.
Teacher: Ninataka. I want to sleep?
Student: Ninataka kulala.
Teacher: Ninataka kulala. And the word for now, which was also a repeated syllable like lala?
Student: Sasa.
Teacher: Sasa. Very good. I want to sleep now.
Student: Ninataka kulala sasa.
    
Teacher: Ninataka kulala sasa. Or that's quite flexible. You could also say Sasa ninataka kulala. I
  want to eat now. So, we think through it bit by bit. We don't want to translate the whole idea.
  The first bit we can think about is I want.
Student: Ninataka.
Teacher: Ninataka. To eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Now.
Student: Sasa.
Teacher: Very good. Ninataka kula sasa. Very good. So, we have ni for I and na for present, no? The
  sound for you is just u, u.
Student: U.
Teacher: So, that's just the letter u, no? So, we have the letter u for you. So how does you in the present
  sound like?
Student: Una.
Teacher: Good. So, we want to pronounce of as clearly as well and avoid any transfer from English where
  we might say like ou, you know? I make it kind of a bit weaker the vowel. The vowels tend to
  be quite weak in English. It's a clear open vowel, una.
Student: Una.
Teacher: So, what was to want?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. Good. All you need to do is think about the first, the first bit which we know is ku and
  that really helps the memory just to follow on and find the next bit. Kutaka, to want. You want?
Student: Unataka.
Teacher: Unataka. You want to sleep?
Student: Unataka kulala.
Teacher: Unataka kulala. Good. Do you want to sleep? Now, to make a question we can just raise the
  intonation. So, how would that sound. Do you want to sleep?
Student: Unataka kulala?
Teacher: Good. Unataka kulala? Good. And the word for now?
Student: Sasa.
Teacher: Do you want to sleep now?
Student: Unataka kulala sasa?
Teacher: Unataka kulala sasa? You're sleeping.
Student: Unalala.
Teacher: Unalala. Are you sleeping?
Student: Unalala?
Teacher: Unalala? What was to laugh or also to laugh at? It means both to laugh, to laugh at.
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. Good. You're laughing.
Student: Unacheka.
Teacher: Unacheka. Now you're laughing. You're laughing now.
Student: Unacheka sasa.
Teacher: Unacheka sasa. Sasa unacheka. What was the sound for I again?
Student: Nina. Ni.
Teacher: Ni. Good. We want to think about this separately. Good. The sound for I is ni but the sound for
  present?
Student: Na.
Teacher: Na. So, I in the present?
Student: Nina.
Teacher: Nina. So, I'm laughing?
   
Student: Ninacheka.
Teacher: Ninacheka. Ni, other than the sound for I is also the sound for me but when it's me it goes after
  the time sound. So, the time sound that we have so far is now na for present. So, if you want to
  say something like: You're laughing at me, you will say you, present, me, laugh. So, all of that
  information goes before the verb. So, how would that be: You're laughing at me. You, present,
  me, laugh.
Student: Unanicheka.
Teacher: Unanicheka. All one word. You're laughing at me. And we don't need the at because like I
  mentioned kucheka can be to laugh or to laugh at. Unanicheka. You're laughing at me. Now,
  you're laughing at me.
Student: Unanicheka sasa.
Teacher: Unanicheka sasa. Sasa unanicheka. Very good.
Swahili Track 04
Teacher: What was to want?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. And I want?
Student: Ninataka.
Teacher: Ninataka. You might also hear nataka as a short form which is very common like the ni gets
  dropped out. Nataka.
Student: Nataka.
Teacher: So, that's very common to hear in spoken Swahili. You want.
Student: Unataka.
Teacher: Unataka. And you won't drop the u here. It's only with the I form that it's common to drop that
  and have nataka. So, for you, you will have unataka. To see is kuona. That's k-u-o-n-a. Kuona.
Student: Kuana.
    
Teacher: Kuona, ona.
Student: Kuana.
Teacher: Just say ona by itself.
Student: Ona.
Teacher: And then kuona.
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. Good. So, which bit gives us the meaning of see in kuona, to see.
Student: Ona.
Teacher: Ona. Very good. I see.
Student: Ninaona.
Teacher: Ninaona. Very good. And if you were to use the shortcut that you might often hear and spoken
  Swahili?
Student: Naona.
Teacher: Naona. Very good. What is mmh, you see.
Student: Unaona.
Teacher: Unaona. Very good. You see me. How would that be?
Student: Unaniona.
Teacher: Very good. So, ni other than I can also mean me when it's placed after the sound time like na.
  Unaniona. Do you see?
Student: Unaniona?
Teacher: Very good. Do you see me now?
Student: Unaniona sasa?
Teacher: Unaniona sasa? Very good. And, give me again I want.
Student: Ninataka.
Teacher: Ninataka. And with the shortcut?
    
Student: Nataka.
Teacher: Nataka. I want to eat.
Student: Nataka kula.
Teacher: Nataka kula. Ninataka kula. I want to see.
Student: Ninataka kuona.
Teacher: Ninataka kuona or nataka kuona. Very good. What was to laugh again?
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. You’re laughing.
Student: Unacheka.
Teacher: Unacheka. You're laughing at me.
Student: Unanicheka.
Teacher: Unanicheka. Are you laughing at me?
Student: Unanicheka?
Teacher: Unanicheka? So, you’ve seen now if we want to make a question in Swahili we can just use
  our intonation, no? But also, we have a question marker; a sound that shows or highlights that
  we are making a question, that we can use if we want to. So, this sound is je, je. So, this is j-e.
  Maybe you can think of it as a j but starting kind of smiley. So, you know if you kind of open
  your lips like you're smiling and you go je.
Student: Je.
Teacher: Je.
Teacher: That's much closer to the sound. So, you know I will instruct you on how to make the sounds
  and how to think about them but you should base your pronunciation or native speakers rather
  than strictly on mine. So, you can you can use je to introduce a question. Say, you know like,
  je, are you laughing at me?
Student: Je unanicheka?
   
Teacher: Je unanicheka? Good. So, je is a sound that lets us know a question is coming, like do when
  we say do you see me? Do there, doesn't mean anything but it shows us a question is coming,
  no? How would you say that in Swahili? Do you see me?
Student: Je unaniona?
Teacher: Very good. Je unaniona. So, we can use this to show we are introducing a question and then
  the intonation is not so important but you can still make that intonation that question sounds if
  you feel like. Je unaniona? What was to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: Kulala. Are you sleeping?
Student: Je unalala?
Teacher: Good. Je unalala? To want?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. Do you want to sleep?
Student: Je unataka kulala?
Teacher: Good. Je unataka kulala? Do you want to eat now? What was do it for now?
Student: Sasa.
Teacher: Sasa. Good. Do you want to eat now?
Student: Je unataka kula sasa?
Teacher: Very good. Je unataka kula sasa? And what was to see?
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. Do you see it? Now, if the it doesn't refer to an object, you know? Maybe it's something
  that's happening over there, then we don't translate it. So, just do you see?
Student: Je unaona?
Teacher: Je unaona? So, the it if it doesn't refer to any specific object, no? We can just say do you see.
  Je unaona? Do you see me?
Student: Je unaniona?
    
Teacher: Je unaniona? So, this je, this je is a marker. It doesn't mean anything. It just shows us that we
   have a question coming. And languages use markers of all kinds and four kinds of thingStudent: for
   questions, for getting attention, for calling people's names or addressing people. Another marker
   in English for example is I say, you, no? Like in, I say that's a nice jacket. When you say I say
   that's a nice jacket, I say just shows some kind of emphasis to what you're about to say, no?
   Believe it or not, this particular marker found this way into Swahili, aisee. You will hear that in
   Swahili and it's just from English, actually. Aisee.
Student: Aisee.
Teacher: Aisee. So, it's like a-i-s-e-e and you know the accent is on the end which is probably why we
   have to es so we can kind of treat them like two syllables, no? And still stick by our role of
   having the accent on the second last syllable, aisEe. It's like the accents on the first e.
Student: Aisee.
Teacher: So, you'd be forgiven for not noticing that this is just the English I say but with the most Swahili
   sound to it. And it's used quite commonly. You could say something like I say, you're laughing
   at me. How would that be?
Student: Aisee, unanicheka.
Teacher: Aisee, unanicheka. I say, do you see me?
Student: Aisee, je…
Teacher: So, it's like the je sound but with less friction and we're starting kind of more smiley. So, je, je,
   je.
Student: Aisee, je unaniona?
Teacher: Good. Aisee, je unaniona? Aisee, unaniona? Good.
Swahili Track 05
Teacher: What was to want, again?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. Kutoka. So, k-u-t-o-k-a means to get or go out, to exit. Kutoka.
Student: Kutoka.
Teacher: So, how would you say I'm going out now.
Student: Ninatoka sasa.
Teacher: Very good. Ninatoka sasa or just natoka sasa with the shortcut that we have for I, no? So, how
   would you say I want to get out, I want to go out.
Student: Ninataka kutoka.
Teacher: Yep. Ninataka kutoka or nataka kutoka. Good. Kutoka, to get out can also be used like I am
   from; like I am out of America, for example, I am from America. The word for America is
   Marekani. Marekani.
Student: Marekani.
Teacher: So, it's just the word America but played around with a little bit the sound more Swahili, no?
   Swahili likes very much consonant vowel, consonant vowel, consonant vowel, which we can
   see already with the words we've learned kulala, kutaka, kutoka, no? So, Marekani, America.
   So, if you want to say I am from America, you will say I get out America. So, how is to get out,
   to go out?
Student: Kutoka.
Teacher: Kutoka. So, tell me I'm from America.
Student: Ninakutoka Marekani.
Teacher: A little slower. So, give me the first bit, I go out or I get out.
Student: Ninatoka.
Teacher: Ninatoka. Good. Not kutoka, no? We get rid of the ku. Ninatoka or natoka with a shortcut.
   America.
Student: Marekani.
Teacher: All together.
Student: Ninatoka Marekani.
Teacher: Ninatoka or natoka Marekani. Are you from Kenya? Kenya is the same in Swahili.
Student: Unatoka Kenya?
Teacher: Good. Unatoka Kenya? Or if you want to use the marker je, unatoka Kenya? The word for
  where in Swahili is wapi. Wapi.
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: W-a-p-i, wapi.
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: Now, if you want to say where are you from. The most common position for wapi is after the
  verb. So, you are from where is how we would say it in Swahili. So, how would that be where
  are you from, you are from where?
Student: Unatoka wapi?
Teacher: Unatoka wapi? Very good. And when we have a question word like wapi we're not likely to
  hear this je, the question sound. Unatoka wapi? What was to want?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. Where do you want to sleep? So, we will say you want to sleep where.
Student: Unataka kulala wapi?
Teacher: You want to sleep where.
Student: Unataka kulala wapi.
Teacher: Good. Unataka kulala wapi. We never want to push ourselves to go just a little bit faster than
  what we comfortable with, no? Because it's very easy to jump over ideas or to think we've dealt
  with an idea that we haven't. So, slowly and we make a very solid clear pathway in our mind.
  Unataka kulala wapi. And what was to eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula. Where do you want to eat?
Student: Unataka kula wapi?
Teacher: Good. Unataka kula wapi? Where do you sleep? Where are you sleeping?
Student: Unalala wapi?
  
Teacher: Unalala wapi? Very good. We can also make the order like when you tell somebody to do
   something, no? Like sleep, no? If you tell somebody to sleep, sleep. We can also do that in
   Swahili very easily. We just do what we do in English. We drop the to from the verb. So, we
   have to sleep, kulala and to tell somebody to sleep we just say sleep all by itself.
Student: Lala.
Teacher: Lala. You might hear also in Swahili lala salama which means sleep well, no? Literally
   something like sleep peacefully. We have salama like in Arabic, salaam alaikum meaning piece
   or peacefully. You might say that lala salama. To want?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. To exit, to get, out to be from?
Student: Kutoka.
Teacher: Kutoka. Get out.
Student: Toka.
Teacher: Toka. To travel in Swahili is kusafiri, kusafiri.
Student: Kusafiri.
Teacher: Now most verbs in Swahili end in an a as we've seen and mentioned, no? Kutaka, kutoka,
   kulala, kula, kucheka, kuona. We've seen a lot of verb so far. Kusafiri doesn’t end in a and
   it's from Arabic. So, most verbs from Arabic they won't end in an a. They will look a little bit
   different, like kusafiri. Which bit in kusafiri is about traveling?
Student: Safri.
Student: Safiri. Ku just means to, no? And does safiri look or sound like anything in English? Safiri.
   Safari.
Student: Aahh.
Teacher: So, this is like I mentioned actually from Arabic origin but it seems to have entered English
   through Swahili, not Arabic. So, that's where we get safari from, no? Kusafiri, to travel. What
   are the vowels in safiri? The vowel sounds.
Student: A-i-i.
  
Teacher: Yes. It's a good job just to note it when you have a word that has a lot of vowels. The vowels
  are what most often get lost in the memory. So, this isn’t a memorizing we don’t want to sit
  there and go like a-i-i, a-i-i. We just want to go to ourselves and what are the vowel sounds
  there? A-i-i. And I’m making the vowel sound, not the letter, no? The letters are a-i-i; s-a-f-i-r-
  i. And just getting in the habit of doing that safiri: a-i-i is very helpful for the memory. Kusafiri.
  What is do you want? Do you want?
Student: Unataka?
Teacher: Good. Unataka? Je unataka? Do you want to travel?
Student: Unataka kusafiri?
Teacher: Unataka kusafiri? Good. Where do you want to travel? You want to travel where?
Student: Unataka kusafiri wapi?
Teacher: Very good. Unataka kusafiri wapi? Good. And if in the sentence like this you have any
  insecurity you know what is the word for where, don't think about it until you get there. Just
  work out what did you need to think about first and just think about that bit. So, you want to
  travel where? Unataka kusafiri wapi? I am traveling, I'm traveling.
Student: Ninasafiri.
Teacher: Ninasafiri. I'm traveling now.
Student: Ninasafiri sasa.
Teacher: You are travelling.
Student: Unasafiri.
Teacher: Are you traveling?
Student: Je unasafiri?
Teacher: Unasafiri? Je unasafiri? Where are you traveling?
Student: Unasafiri wapi?
Teacher: Unasafiri wapi? Good. And where does wapi go?
Student: To the end.
   
Teacher: At the end? Or how did we describe it? After the verb, because if you say something like where
   are you traveling now?
Student: Unasafiri wapi sasa?
Teacher: Very good. Unasafiri wapi sasa? or Sasa unasafiri wapi? So, the question word like wapi
   doesn't go on the end rather after the verb. And if you just tell somebody to travel? If you give
   the order?
Student: Safiri.
Teacher: Safiri. Good. So, as I mentioned this verb is from Arabic and Swahili has a lot of vocabulary
   from Arabic. In fact, the word Swahili comes from the Arabic word for costs. Swahili being the
   language on the east coast of Africa, so, Swahili just means costs, coastal.
Swahili Track 06
Teacher: So, what was to want, to want?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. And to get out, to be from.
Student: Kutoka.
Teacher: Kutoka. Good. And the word for where?
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: Wapi. So, where are you from?
Student: Unatoka wapi?
Teacher: Very good. Unatoka wapi? And you took the time to think about if it was talking toka or taka
   I guess, no? Good. So, if we have two elements that are similar you know we can use that to
   our benefit like kutaka, kutoka but also can take a little time just to not get them mixed up.
   Very good. Are you from Kenya?
Student: Je unatoka Kenya?
Teacher: Good. Je unatoka Kenya? So, apart from these sounds for people ni for I or me, u for you we
   also have words for people. So, these are sounds that we use to connect to our verbs, no? To
     
  show who's doing what but we also have words. So, ni shows I or me but the word for I or me
  is mimi, m-i-m-i. Like English me, no? But with an i. Mimi.
Student: Mimi.
Teacher: And, of course another double syllable like sasa, now; like the lala of kulala, to sleep. So, you
  don't have to use mimi but you can to be emphatic for example, or maybe just for another second
  think, or to contrast or whatever. It's also commonly used to introduce that you're talking about
  yourself for the first time, no, in a conversation and then dropped. You don't have to use it again.
  So, listen out to see how people use it in real life, in different dialects with the Swahili speakers
  you're practicing with. What was the world for America?
Student: Marekani.
Teacher: Marekani. Good. So, I'm from America.
Student: Ninatoka Marekani.
Teacher: Ninatoka Marekani. But if you were talking about yourself for the first time for example and
  you wanted to use the word for I? So, me, I'm from America.
Student: Mimi ninatoka Marekani.
Teacher: Very good. Mimi ninatoka Marekani. Mimi natoka Marekani, no, because we also that
  shortcut. Or maybe you would want to use this mimi to contrast like if you say for example: no,
  I'm from America. The word for no is hapana. Hapana.
Student: Hapana.
Teacher: It’s change three syllables for no, no? Hapana. So, how would you say that: no, I'm from
  America.
Student: Hapana, mimi ninatoka Marekani.
Teacher: Very good. Hapana, mimi ninatoka Marekani. Very good. So, I've mentioned a little bit about
  dialects, no? Swahili or any language really, is a concept more than a thing. The only thing that
  really exists in the real world are dialects, no? A certain dielectic group together as a language
  and often choose one to be official. So, you will get slightly different habits in different dialects
  of Swahili so for example in some places it's very common to hear la for no. La.
 
Student: La.
Teacher: Which is just Arabic word, la, otherwise hapana. What is I want?
Student: Ninataka.
Teacher: Ninataka. I want to go out.
Student: Ninataka kutoka.
Teacher: Ninataka kutoka. Good. I'm going out now.
Student: Ninatoka sasa.
Teacher: Very good. Ninatoka sasa. So, na is a sound for present, no? So, I in the present is.
Student: Nina.
Teacher: Nina. And you in the present.
Student: Una.
Teacher: Una. Na also means and. You will see Swahili recycling sounds quite a bit in this way. So. we
  have na for the present and also for the word and.
Student: Na.
Teacher: I want to eat.
Student: Ninatoka… no Ninataka kula.
Teacher: Very good. Ninataka kula. Very good. I want to sleep and eat. So, that would be I want to
  sleep and to eat.
Student: Ninataka kulala na kula.
Teacher: Very good. Ninataka kulala na kula. So, we have na for the present and for the word and.
  What was the sound for I or me.
Student: Ni.
Teacher: Ni. And the word for I or me?
Student: Mimi.
 
Teacher: Mimi. If we want to say I want to go out, and you?; I want to eat and you? Well we need the
  word for you. What was the sound for you?
Student: U.
Teacher: U. So, u is the sound for you and that's what we use, no, when we're building our verbs but the
  word for you is wewe, wewe.
Student: Wewe.
Teacher: That's w-e-w-e. So, that's not we, no? Even though it's going to look like we, wewe, w-e-w-e.
  So, that for you. So, how would you say and you?
Student: Na wewe?
Teacher: And here would be very common to use our je to show that we are making a question. Here we
  would actually put it on the end. Na wewe je?
Student: Na wewe je?
Teacher: It's a bit awkward to interrupt and you puting je anywhere else. So, usually we've seen that we
  have it at the beginning but it could also be flexible when it needs to be. I want to go out, and
  you?
Student: Ninataka kutoka, na wewe je?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Ninataka kutoka, na wewe je? And as we’re making a contrast here I
  want to go out, and you? then it would be very common to use mimi hear the word for I. Mimi
  nataka or mimi ninataka kutoka, na wewe je? What was to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: Kulala. I want to sleep, and you? Let's use the word for I. I want to sleep; I wanna sleep, and
  you?
Student: Mimi nataka kulala, na wewe je?
Teacher: Good.
Student: Hehe.
Teacher: Very good. Mimi nataka kulala or mimi ninataka kulala, na wewe je? To eat.
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula. I want to eat now, and you?
Student: Mimi ninataka kula sasa, na wewe je?
Teacher: Very good. Mimi ninataka kula sasa, na wewe je? Na other than the present and other than
  and also means with, so you could say I want to eat with you. How would that be?
Student: Ninataka kula na wewe.
Teacher: Ninataka kula na wewe. Very good. I want to eat with you. Ninataka kula na wewe. I'm going
  out now, and you?
Student: Ninatoka sasa, na wewe je?
Teacher: Ninatoka sasa, na wewe je? Do you want to go out with me? So, let's begin with Do you want?
Student: Je unataka kutoka na mimi?
Teacher: Very good. Je uanataka kutoka na mimi? Me, I'm from Kenya. Where are you from?
Student: Mimi ninatoka Kenya.
Teacher: Where are you from?
Student: Wewe unatoka wapi?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Me, I'm from Kenya. Where are you from? Mimi ninatoka Kenya.
  Wewe unatoka wapi? What was the word to laugh?
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. And I'm laughing.
Student: Ninacheka.
Teacher: And what if we wanted to it with I? I'm laughing.
Student: Mimi nacheka.
Teacher: Mimi nacheka, mimi ninacheka. Are you laughing?
Student: Unacheka?
Teacher: Good, but if we have this emphasis on the word for you? Are you laughing?
   
Student: Wewe unacheka?
Teacher: Wewe unacheka? Good. Are you laughing at me? What am I emphasizing there? Are you
  laughing at me?
Student: Me.
Teacher: Good.
Student: Unamimicheka.
Teacher: So, mimi is the word for me. What's the sound for I or me?
Student: Ni.
Teacher: Ni. So, the sound is what we use when we're building the verbs, no? So, let's try that again. Are
  you laughing at me?
Student: Unanicheka?
Teacher: Good. Unanicheka. And we said that we were emphasizing. Are you laughing at ME? So, we
  just repeat the information. Unanichake mimi?
Student: Unanicheka mimi?
Teacher: Je unanicheka mimi? You can even stress both things if you want to. Are YOU laughing at
  ME? How would that be?
Student: Wewe unanicheka mimi?
Teacher: Very good. Wewe unanicheka mimi? Je wewe unanicheka mimi? And there we’re repeating
  all of the information, no? Wewe and u; and mimi and ni. Wewe unanicheka mimi. So, these
  are the words we just use them to be emphatic, to contrast, to give us a second to think and often
  when we are talking about somebody for the first time, no? Very good.
Swahili Track 07
Teacher: To see, to see was kuona. Ku-ona, kuona.
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: And how would you say I see?
    
Student: Ninaona.
Teacher: Good, but it’s I see. We’re being emphatic.
Student: Mimi naona.
Teacher: Good. Mimi naona. Mimi ninaona. When you put mimi you leave up the ni, I noticed which
  is quite intuitive because you will hear people do this. It's kind of especially unnecessary, no, if
  you have the mimi to have ni as well. You will also hear people shorting mimi to mi. So, you
  might just hear minaona, no, which might just sound like Ninaona. I see it, do you? And we
  don't need one for it if we're not referring to an object. So, if we say, you know, do you see it
  that thing that's happening over there we don't need it. So, I see it and you?
Student: Mimi naona, na wewe.
Teacher: And make it a question.
Student: Na wewe je?
Teacher: Very good. Mimi naona; mimi ninaona, na wewe je? So, the je here is especially important
  because na also means with, no? So, otherwise it might just sound like I see it with you. What
  do you see with? Hehehe. So, to make that very clear we can have je on the end there. Ninaona;
  mimi ninaona, na wewe je? What if we want to stress you? Do YOU see it?
Student: Je wewe unaona?
Teacher: Je wewe unaona? Je unaona wewe? Good. So, wewe is quite flexible, like we said it's
  emphatic. The information of you is already included in the verb structure with u, no? Unaona.
  So, that wewe being extra is very flexible. Wewe unaona. Unaona wewe. Do you see me?
Student: Una… Unaniona mimi?
Teacher: Very good, if you’re stressing the me, no? Do you see ME? You could add the mimi there. Je
  unaniona mimi? Kufanya. Kufanya means to do or to make. Kufanya.
Student: Kufanya.
Teacher: So, which bit there has the meaning of doing or making?
Student: Fanya.
Teacher: Fanya. Good. And that's f-a-n-y-a. Kufanya. I'm doing it.
 
Student: Ninafanya.
Teacher: Ninafanya. You are doing it.
Student: Unafanya.
Teacher: Unafanya. Are you doing it?
Student: Je unafanya?
Teacher: Je unafanya? This marker je that we used to introduce a question, can also be used like how;
  like the word how but for this meeting we stick it on the end of the verb. We hook it onto the
  end of the verb. So, it's not a word in its own right anymore. It becomes part of the verb, which
  means if you say something like how do you do it? it's all one word in Swahili. So, do you want
  to try that? How do you do it? And the je is going to come at the end. You do it how?
Student: Una… unafanya… unaFANyaJE?
Teacher: Good, but if you say unaFANyaJE it sounds like a separate word but the word for how becomes
  part of the verb. Where does the accent go in Swahili words? The stress.
Student: Last syllable. No, second last.
Teacher: The second last syllable, no? So, when you put that je on the end of unafanya well, the accent
  will move.
Student: Unafanyaje?
Teacher: That's it. Unafanyaje? How do you do it? Unafanyaje, no? So, it all becomes one word and
  we hear that because the accent moves.
Student: Unafanyaje.
Teacher: Good. How was to travel, like safari in English?
Student: Kusafiri.
Teacher: Kusafiri. Good. Do you travel?
Student: Je unasafiri?
Teacher: Unasafiri. Je unasafiri? How do you travel?
Student: Unasafirije?
   
Teacher: Very good. Very good for moving the accent, no? Unasafirije. So, this means How do you
   travel not Are you traveling? but how. So, when we have je on the end of the verb we get the
   meaning of how. Unasafirije. How do you travel? You know, like by car, plane, with your
   savings; how. To say or even to speak, in some dialects this is used like to speak, is kusema.
   Kusema.
Student: Kusema.
Teacher: How do you think we spell that?
Student: K-u-c-e-m-a.
Teacher: C?
Student: S.
Teacher: S would be much more natural. C-e is much more English or Latin, like French.
Student: French. Hahaha.
Teacher: Kusema. K-u-s-e-m-a. So, that's to say or even to speak. So, how would you say: you say; you
   speak?
Student: Unasema.
Teacher: Unasema. How do you say?
Student: Unasemaje?
Teacher: Unasemaje? And this is just like What, come again? Like if you don't understand somebody or
   something you can say How do you say? Unasemaje? You wouldn't use this to ask how to say
   something, no? Just like What, come again? Unasemaje? I mentioned how Swahili comes from
   the word coast in Arabic. And Kiswahili is how you say Swahili in Swahili. So, Swahili in
   Swahili is Kiswahili.
Student: Kiswahili.
Teacher: Ki means something like language of. So, Kiswahili is like language of the costs in the mixture
   of Bantu or Swahili and Arabic. Kiswahili. So, ki is a little bit we add on the beginning to mean
   language of. Do you speak Swahili?
Student: Una… Unasema Kiswahili?
    
Teacher: Unasema Kiswahili? Good. And I should mention again that this verb is used for to speak
  only in some dialects. In others, it will sound quite peculiar when used like to speak not to say.
  So, another common verb for to speak in this sense is kuongea. So, you might hear Unaongea
  Kiswahili? Unaongea Kiswahili? So, like always you can listen out to the dialect of the people
  you're practicing with. The word for England is Uingereza. Uingereza.
Student: Uingereza.
Teacher: So, then we break that down. You have u, at the beginning which often is for countries.
  Countries often have an u at the beginning. And then ingereza. England. I-n-g-e-r-e-z-a. So,
  we have u for country and ki for language. So, u mean something like land of. Uingereza, land
  of England. So a bit repetitive actually, land of England. Uingereza. And you know, we don't
  always have this u we've seen Marekani, Kenya. It's not there. What was to get out or to be
  from.
Student: Kutoka.
Teacher: Kutoka. I'm from England, and YOU? Pay attention to the stresses, no? I am from England,
  and YOU?
Student: Mimi natoka Ing... I forgot what’s England.
Teacher: So, how does it start?
Student: Uingereza.
Teacher: U is just how does start. It is the most helpful question you can ever ask yourself whether you're
  building a sentence or looking for a word. How does it start? Very good. Uingereza. So I'm
  from England.
Student: Mimi natoka Uingereza.
Teacher: Mimi natoka Uingereza. And you?
Student: Na wewe je?
Teacher: Good. Na wewe je? Are you from China? How do you think China might be in Swahili?
Student: Uchina.
Teacher: Uchina. Good. Although you will also hear China used in Swahili. So, Uchina or China. Are
  you from china?
Student: Unatoka China, Uchina?
Teacher: Unatoka Uchina? Je unatoka Uchina? What was the word for England again?
Student: Uingereza.
Teacher: Uingereza. English is Kiingereza. So, we get rid of the u for country and we put ki for
  language. Language of England, Kiingereza. So, we have two is there. Kiingereza.
Student: Kiingereza. Kiingereza.
Teacher: Do you speak English?
Student: Unasema Kiingereza? Je unasema Kiingereza? and as I mentioned you could hear kuongea
for this as well. Unaongea Kiingereza? What was China again?
Student: Uchina.
Teacher: Uchina. And what is Chinese?
Student: Kichina.
Teacher: Kichina. Do you speak Chinese?
Student: Unasema Kichina?
Teacher: Unasema Kichina? Unaongea Kichina?
Swahili Track 08
Teacher: What was to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: Kulala. Are you sleeping?
Student: Je unakula… no Je unalala?
Teacher: Je unalala? Sleep.
Student: Lala.
Teacher: Lala. Sleep. If you're telling someone to sleep. So, we have to sleep. Kulala. And what was to
  eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula. Verbs that are very short like this, like kula. Ku and then just one other syllable often
  keep the ku outside of the true form. So, for example if we say I'm eating it’s ninakula rather
  than ninala, no? So, we keep ku when we start to build with the verb and they're very short like
  this. So, how would you say you are eating.
Student: Unakula.
Teacher: Unakula. Are you eating?
Student: Je unakula?
T. Unakula? Je unakula? Where?
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: Wapi. Where are you eating?
Student: Unakula wapi?
Teacher: Unakula wapi? Unakula wapi? So, wapi goes after the verb but it doesn't hook onto it, no?
  It's a separate word and you hear to accents unaKUla WApi. But how, how if we say how do
  you eat? that's something we hook on to the end of the verb and changes how it all sounds. So,
  how would you say that: How do you eat?
Student: Unakulaje?
Teacher: Unakulaje? How do you eat? So, maybe you would say this if I don't know somebody had the
  dental work or some accident or something. So, we have unakulaje and we keeping that ku of
  kula. In the same way if you tell someone to eat like you give the order, you don't lose the ku,
  you would just say to eat.
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Eat now.
Student: Kula sasa.
Teacher: Eat now. Kula sasa. To do or to make was kufanya.
Student: Kufanya.
Teacher: I'm doing it.
Student: Ninafanya.
Teacher: Ninafanya, no? So, generally we lose our ku, no, when we start building with a verb. So,
   kufanya and then I'm doing it ninafanya. Are you doing it?
Student: Je unafanya?
Teacher: Je unafanya? Do it now.
Student: Fanya sasa.
Teacher: Fanya sasa. So, in all of these examples it doesn't refer to an object, it refers to an action, no,
   so we don't translate it. I'm doing it, ninafanya. Do it now, fanya sasa. Another important verb
   like kula with just one syllable after ku is to come, kuja. K-u-j-a.
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. I'm coming now.
Student: Ninakuja sasa.
Teacher: Ninakuja sasa. Are you coming?
Student: Je unakuja?
Teacher: Je unakuja? How are you coming?
Student: Unakujaje?
Teacher: Very good. Unakujaje? The word for here is hapa. H-a-p-a. Hapa.
Student: Hapa.
Teacher: That's here. Are you coming here?
Student: Je unakuja hapa?
Teacher: Unakuja hapa? Je unakuja hapa? How are you coming here?
Student: Unakujaje hapa?
Teacher: Very good. Unakujaje hapa, how are you coming here. So, give me again to come.
  
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. To know is kujua. K-u-j-u-a. Kujua.
Student: Kujua.
Teacher: How would you say I know?
Student: Ninajua.
Teacher: Very good, because jua is two syllables, no, so we don't keep a ku there. Ninajua. I want to
  know.
Student: Ninataka kujua.
Teacher: Ninataka kujua. Do you know?
Student: Unajua?
Teacher: Unajua? Do you know me?
Student: Unanijua?
Teacher: Very good. Unanijua? And what if you want to emphasize me. Do you know ME?
Student: Unanijua mimi?
Teacher: Unanijua mimi? Good. How do you know me?
Student: Unani… Unanijuaje mimi?
Teacher: If you’d wanted to emphasize? Mimi, no? Good. How do you know me? Unanijuaje? How do
  you know ME? if you want to emphasize it unanijuaje mimi. Very good. So, we have kula, to
  eat; kuja, to come and these most of the time keep the ku and we build with them because they
  have just one syllable. Ku-la, ku-ja. So, if you tell somebody to, to sleep, how is it?
Student: Lala.
Teacher: But if you tell somebody to eat.
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Very good. Come, the order like come; come here is very strange. It’s njoo. So, that’s n-j-o-o.
  Njoo.
   
Student: Njoo.
Teacher: So, we start just with n sound without any vowel before, no? We don't say enjoo but n, n,
  njoo.
Student: Njoo.
Teacher: Good. And the accent is on the end, no? So, it has 2 o's. It's like the two o, they pretend to be
  two syllables, no, and the accent goes on the first one. Njoo.
Student: Njoo.
Teacher: Like in aisee, no? I say, a-i-s-e-e and we had accident the first e. NjOo, aisEe. On the first of
  the double vowel. Njoo, come. Come here.
Student: Njoo sasa.
Teacher: That would mean come now.
Student: Njoo hapa.
Teacher: Njoo hapa. Come here now.
Student: Njoo hapa sasa.
T Njoo hapa sasa. Very good. Njoo hapa sasa. Very good.
Swahili Track 09
Teacher: What was to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: And here?
Student: Hapa.
Teacher: Hapa. I sleep here, and you?
Student: Mimi nalala hapa, na wewe je?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Mimi ninalala hapa; mimi nalala hapa, na wewe je? Are you sleeping
  here?
Student: Je unalala hapa?
 
Teacher: Unalala hapa? Je unalala hapa? To eat, what was to eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula. And I eat or I'm eating.
Student: Ninakula.
Teacher: Ninakula. Good..We keep the ku, no, because it's a short verb, kula. Are you eating now?
Student: Unakula sasa?
Teacher: Unakula sasa? And what if we wanted to use the word for you: You, are you eating now?
Student: Wewe unakula sasa?
Teacher: Very good. Wewe unakula sasa? So, we might use this wewe to contrast, to get the attention…
  Wewe unakula sasa? If you want to say something like I will sleep; I'm going to sleep, now
  we don't use na anymore, which is for the present. We use ta, t-a. Ta.
Student: Ta.
Teacher: which is for the future. So, what is the sound for I in the future?
Student: Nita.
Teacher: Good. And the sound for you in the future?
Student: Uta.
Teacher: Uta. So, how would you say I will sleep here.
Student: Nitalala hapa.
Teacher: Very good. Nitalala hapa. The word for later, later in Swahili is baadae. Baadae.
Student: Baadae.
Teacher: That’s b-a-a, and you pronounce both d-a-e. And we've seen already in two examples like njoo,
  come, the order and also aisee, no, I say got into Swahili, that when we have two vowels together
  they count like two syllables, no? So, we have the accent on the penultimate one, on the da.
  BaaDAe. But we still have two at the beginning so you pronounce both a’s at the beginning but
  the da is still accented. BaaDAe.
Student: Baadae.

Teacher: Very good. Baadae, later. I will sleep later.
Student: Nitalala baadae.
Teacher: Nitalala baadae. Good. I will eat here.
Student: Nitakula hapa.
Teacher: Nitakula hapa. What was to come?
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. And to know?
Student: Kujua.
Teacher: Kujua. Do you know where you will eat? So, let's break that up. Do you know?
Student: Utajua?
Teacher: Utajua would mean will you know.
Student: Ahh, unajua?
Teacher: Unajua. Where you will eat; you will it where?
Student: Utakula wapi?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Do you know where you eat? Do you know you will eat where? Unajua
  utakula wapi? So, in the future for I we have nita and in the present we have…
Student: Nina.
Teacher: Nina. What was to eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula. And later?
Student: Baadae.
Teacher: Baadae. I will eat later.
Student: Nitakula baadae.
Teacher: Very good. Nitakula baadae. And here?
 
Student: Hapa.
Teacher: Hapa. Will you eat here later? will you eat here later?
Student: Je utakula hapa baadae?
Teacher: Very good. Je utakula hapa baadae? Will you eat here later? Very good. What was to want?
Student: Kutaka.
Teacher: Kutaka. This ta that we use for the future actually comes from kutaka often taka, no, just like
  will in English which is just the German word for want. We can even use will like want in
  English, no? My will is to go… The will to live… And also, Greek and the number of other
  languages express the idea of future this way, with the idea of wanting. So, Swahili is no
  exception in this case our ta, for future, is just from kutaka, to want. What was to do; to make?
Student: Kufanya.
Teacher: Kufanya. Good. I will do it later.
Student: Nitafanya… Nitafanya baadae.
Teacher: Very good. Nitafanya baadae. You will do it. Let's put that emphasis. YOU will do it.
Student: Wewe utafanya.
Teacher: Wewe utafanya. Will you do it later?
Student: Wewe utafanya baadae?
Teacher: Wewe utafanya baadae? Good. Utafanya baadae? How will you do it?
Student: Utafanyaje?
Teacher: Utafanyaje? Very good. What was to come?
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. Will you come later?
Student: Utakuja baadae?
Teacher: Utakuja baadae? How are you coming later? How will you come later?
   
Student: Utakuyaje baadae?
Teacher: Very good. Utakuyaje baadae? Very good. When you have a word like later or some other
  strong context that shows you're talking about the future you can also get away with using na
  in Swahili. Like how in English you say how are you coming later they use the present, no, how
  are you coming later and also how will you come later they mean the same and you can do the
  same in Swahili as well. So, unakuyaje baadae or utakuyaje baadae but to be sure that you
  are correct you can stick with na for the present and ta for the future. So, we have kula, to eat;
  kuja, to come. Two shoot verbs that keep their ku when we start building with them because
  they have just one syllable, no? Kula, kuja. Another verb like this is kuwa, kuwa which means
  to be. That's k-u-w-a, to be.
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: Kuwa. I will be here later. I will be… So, first we will build I will be from kuwa, to be.
Student: Nitakuwa.
Teacher: Nitakuwa. Here later.
Student: Hapa baadae.
Teacher: Good. Nitakuwa hapa baadae. Baadae nitakuwa hapa. Will you be here later?
Student: Utakuwa hapa baadae?
Teacher: Very good. Utakuwa hapa baadae? Baadae utakuwa hapa? What was the word for where?
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: Wapi. Where will you be later?
Student: Utakuwa wapi baadae?
Teacher: Very good. So, we have wapi after the verb, no, rather than at the end. Utakuwa wapi baadae
  or Baadae utakua wapi. So, kuwa is to be and kwa very similar sounding kwa, k-w-a means
  for.
Student: Kwa.
Teacher: Kwa kuwa can be used like because, for to be.Kwa kuwa, for to be, because.
Student: Kwa kuwa.
    
Teacher: What was to do or to make?
Student: Kufanya.
Teacher: Kufanya. Very good. I will quit later because I want to eat now. So, I will do it later; I will do
  it.
Student: Nitafanya.
Teacher: Nitafanya. Later.
Student: Baadae.
Teacher: Because or for to be.
Student: Kwa kuwa.
Teacher: Kwa kuwa. I want to eat now.
Student: Ninataka kula sasa.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. I will do it later because I want to eat now. Nitafanya baadae kwa
  kuwa nataka or kwa kuwa ninataka kula sasa. Very good.

Teacher: So, we've seen we have sounds for people, no? Ni for I or me, u for you and sounds for time na
  for the present and we've seen for the future we have…
Student: Ta.
Teacher: Ta. What is to travel?
Student: Kusafiri.
Teacher: Kusafiri. I'm traveling.
Student: Ninasafiri.

Teacher: Utasafirije? Where?
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: Wapi. Where will you travel?
Student: Utasifiri wapi?
Teacher: Very good. Utasafiri wapi? You will travel where? The word for what is nini, n-i-n-i. So, of
  course another double syllable, no, nini, what.
Student: Nini.
Teacher: And this goes after the verb like wapi. What was to laugh or to laugh at?
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. What do you laughing at? or You are laughing at what?
Student: Unacheka nini?
Teacher: Unacheka nini? And what if you want to be emphatic? What are you laughing at?
Student: Wewe unacheka wiwi, ehh nini?
Teacher: Wewe unacheka nini? Good. What was to know?
Student: Kujua.
Teacher: Kujua. Good. If you want to say in Swahili what do I know, you know like, what do I know
  about that; I don't have a clue, you can say how do I know now.
Student: Ninajuaje sasa?
Teacher: Good. Ninajuaje sasa? And being a fixed expression it's very common to drop the ni, no?
  Najuaje sasa? How should I know? Or mi najuaje sasa. Mimi, it can also be shoorten to mi,
  no? Mimi najuaje sasa. Mi najuaje sasa. So, you might hear that, What do I know?. What was
  to see?
    
Student: Kuana.
Teacher: Kuona.
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: What do you see?
Student: Unaona nini?
Teacher: Good. Unaona nini? What do you want to see?
Student: Unataka kuona nini?
Teacher: Very good.
Student: Hahaha.
Teacher: Unataka kuona nini? What was the word for here?
Student: Hapa.
Teacher: Hapa. What do you want to see here? And we mentioned before how the question word comes
  after the verb rather than at the end, no? So, in Swahili we have You want to see what here?
Student: Unataka kuona nini hapa?
Teacher: Very good. Unataka kuona nini hapa? The word for today is leo. L-e-o.
Student: Leo.
Teacher: What do you want to see today? What do you want to see today?
Student: Unataka kuona nini leo?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. I left you there to deal with the older and just think what do I have to
  deal with first, no? Unataka kuona nini leo? You want to see what today? What was to do or
  to make?
Student: Kufanya.
Teacher: Kufanya. What are you doing?
Student: Unafanya nini?
Teacher: Unafanya nini? What are you doing today?
   
Student: Unafanya nini leo?
Teacher: Unafanya nini leo? So, this is actually an example of where we're talking about the future, no?
  What are you doing today? means What will you do today? It's the future. So, that's enough
  context with leo, we don't need to use ta but we can. So, we could hear Unafanya nini leo? or
  Utafanya nini leo? So, what is what?
Student: Nini.
Teacher: Nini. When is lini, l-i-n-i. So, very similar to what. We have nini for what and lini for when.
Student: Lini.
Teacher: When will you do it?
Student: Unafanya lini?
Teacher: Okay. So, this means When do you do it? Unafanya lini? No? If we had the strong context that
  we were talking about the future it could be okay Unafanya lini? but to be clear that you mean
  When will you do it? rather than When do you do it?
Student: Utafanya lini?
Teacher: Utafanya lini? And to eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula. What will you eat today?
Student: Utakula nini leo?
Teacher: Very good. What will you eat today? Utakula nini leo? So, we keep the ku, no, we have kula
  that short verb and we keep the ku when we build with it. What was to be?
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: Kuwa. Very good. When will you be here? You will be when here?
Student: Utakuwa lini hapa?
Teacher: Good. So, we have You will be when here? No? Utakuwa lini hapa? Will you be here later?
Student: Utakuwa hapa baadae?
Teacher: Utakuwa hapa baadae? Badaae utakuwa hapa? Very good. What was to come?
    
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. Good. When do you come?
Student: Uta… Una or Uta.
Teacher: Exactly, it depends, no? It depends on the context. So, if you meant generally When do you
  come?
Student: Unakuja lini?
Teacher: Unakuja lini? When you come? But if you want to say When will you come? When are you
  coming? When are you going to come?
Student: Utakuja lini?
Teacher: Utakuja lini? And as I mentioned that's quite flexible depending on the context that's around.
  You can use na sometimes to talk about the future as we do in English but if you want to be
  sure you're using the right one then na for present and ta future.
Swahili Track 11
Teacher: What was to travel?
Student: Kusafiri.
Teacher: Kusafiri. Good. And the word for where?
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: Wapi. And what was the word for what?
Student: Nini.
Teacher: Nini. Good. And the word for when which was very similar to mimi?
Student: Lini.
Teacher: Lini. Very good. When will you travel? When will you travel?
Student: Utasafiri lini?
Teacher: Very good. Utasafiri lini? Utasafiri lini? The sound for he and she is a.
Student: A.
 
Teacher: So, that's the sound for he and she. It’s the same for he and she, a. So, well what is he or she in
  the present?
Student: Ana.
Teacher: Ana. And in the future?
Student: Ata.
Teacher: Ata. What was to do or to make?
Student: Kufanya.
Teacher: Kufanya. Very good. He is doing it.
Student: Anafanya.
Teacher: Anafanya. What is he doing?
Student: Je anafanya?
Teacher: Je anafanya? would be Is he doing it?
Student: Anafanya nini?
Teacher: Very good. Anafanya nini? What is he doing? What is he doing later?
Student: Anafanya nini baadae?
Teacher: Very good. So, we have baadae, later; so, we can actually use a present there, no? Ana…
  Anafanya nini baadae? But, we could also use the future. So, how would that be?
Student: Atafanya nini baadae?
Teacher: Atafanya nini baadae? So, what is nini and when?
Student: Lini.
Teacher: Lini. When will he do it?
Student: Atafanya lini… Atafanya lini?
Teacher: Atafanya lini? What was to know?
Student: Kujoa.
Teacher: Kujua.
    
Student: Kujua.
Teacher: Do you know?
Student: Unajua?
Teacher: Unajua? Do you know when she will do it?
Student: Unajua atafanya lini?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Unajua atafanya lini? Very good. And the word for where? What was
  the word for where?
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: Wapi. Where will she do it? where will she do it?
Student: Atafanya wapi?
Teacher: Atafanya wapi? Where does she want to do it?
Student: Anataka kufanya wapi?
Teacher: Very good. Anataka kufanya wapi? What does the word for here?
Student: Hapa.
Teacher: Hapa. Very good. What does he want to do here? So, what is the first bit you think about?
Student: He does.
Teacher: Does, he does would be an unintuitive place to start, no, because this is just the marker, this is
  just the question What does he want So, you don't want to start there. You will use kufanya
  where what we want is What does he want so that's what you start, Does he want rather than
  Does he, no?
Student: Anataka?
Teacher: Good. So, What does he want to do here?
Student: Anataka kufanya nini hapa?
Teacher: Anataka kufanya nini hapa? Very good. So, we have nini after the verbs, no? Anataka
  kufanya nini hapa? Here. He wants to do what here? So, we have hapa for here or right here.
 
  Hapa refers to a very specific place, right here. We also have a word for here which gives me
  the feeling of around here, in this zone, in this area and that’s huku.
Student: Huku.
Teacher: Huku. H-u-k-u. Huku.
Student: Huku.
Teacher: So, how would you say What does he want to do around here?
Student: Anataka kufanya nini huku?
Teacher: Very good. Anataka kufanya nini huku? You know like Why is he… Why is he in the zone?
  Why is he in the area? What does he want to do around here? Anataka kufanya nini huku?
  What was to be? It was another short verb like kula, to eat; kuja, to come; and to be?
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: Kuwa. Very good. Will you be here later? Will you be here later?
Student: Utakuwa hapa. Ah, baadae?
Teacher: Very good. Utakuwa hapa baadae? Baadae utakuwa hapa? Good. Will you be around here
  later? Around here, in the area, in the zone.
Student: Utakuwa huku baadae?
Teacher: Very good, or as you see that I'm doing we can put baadae first. Baadae utakuwa huku? What
  was to come?
Student: Kujae.
Teacher: Kuja.
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. What do the verbs tend to end in? What do the verbs in Swahili tend to end in?
Student: A.
Teacher: So, this can help you when you're trying to find Oh, what is the sound? no? What we know
  about the language can also help us access, no, our memory. So, kuj... no it's more likely to be
 
  kuja, no? So, knowing that our verbs tend to end in a will help us. So, to come is kuja. He is
  coming; he comes.
Student: Anakuja.
Teacher: Anakuja. We keep the ku, no, with these short verbs. He's coming here.
Student: Anakuja hapa.
Teacher: Anakuja hapa. The word for today was leo. Leo. L-e-o.
Student: Leo.
Teacher: Is he coming today?
Student: Je anakuja leo?
Teacher: Good. Je anakuja leo? And what else could be used for that? Je anakuja leo? And instead of
  anakuja, what else could we say?
Student: Ah, atakuja.
Teacher: Because it’s the future, no? Atakuja leo? Leo, today; it's later today, in the future. So, we could
  have atakuja leo but it's not necessary anakuja leo is fine because leo gives us the context, no?
  So, we can hear both atakuja leo, anakuja loe. When is he coming?
Student: Ata or anakuja lini?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. So, we could have anakuja lini if the context in the situation or in the
  conversation was clear that we were referring to the future otherwise it would just sound like
  When does he come? It might sound like a general question, no? So, in a case like this where
  we don't have a heavy context we just to be safe say atakuja lini, no? When is he coming?
  Atakuja lini? How will he come today? How will he come today?
Student: Atakujaje leo? Lini leo. No, oh. Hahaha.
Teacher: Of course, we can’t have how when together, no? How will he come today? Atakujaje leo?
  And again, here with leo, you know, you know that it's today that hasn't happened yet, so, maybe
  you could hear na. Anakujaje leo? So, like I said there's a slight crossover with the two tenses
  as there is in English but if you want to be safe then you just stick to na for present and ta for
  future.
  
Swahili Track 12
Teacher: The word for thing, thing in Swahili is kitu, kitu.
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: K-i-t-u, thing, kitu.
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: And that can also be used like something. How would you say Do you want?
Student: Unataka?
Teacher: Unataka? Do you want something?
Student: Unataka kitu?
Teacher: Unataka kitu? Good. Do you want to eat something here?
Student: Unataka kitu hapa?
Teacher: That means Do you want something here? but Do you want to eat something here?
Student: Unataka kula kitu hapa?
Teacher: Good. Unataka kula kitu hapa? Do you want to eat something around here? Don't worry
   about around here until you get there. So, again Do you want?
Student: Unataka?
Teacher: To eat something.
Student: Kula kitu.
Teacher: Good. Around here. The question always is how does it start, no? So how did you start?
Student: Huku.
Teacher: Huku. So, Do you want to eat something around here?
Student: Unataka kula kitu huku?
Teacher: Do you want to eat something around here? Unataka kula kitu huku? Good. And Do you
   know? How would that be Do you know?
Student: Unajua?
      
Teacher: Unajua? Do you know what you want to eat?
Student: Unajua kula nini?
Teacher: So, you're jumping very fast over the idea, no? So, what we need to do is to slow it right down,
  to make sure that we’ve dealt with each piece of information. So, the first bit is Do you know?
Student: Unajua?
Teacher: Unajua? What? We can have it here to be kind of emphatic, Do you know WHAT you want to
  eat? or we can leave it for later. What would you like to do?
Student: Nini?
Teacher: Okay, nini, we put it here. You want.
Student: Unataka.
Teacher: To eat.
Student: Kula.
Teacher: There you are, ah? So, we must go slowly. And the more Swahili we learn the more we want to
  show ourselves that we know it, so, we just want to say it and we want to say it forever quicker.
  But, during the course, no, especially, we want to take as much time as we need to think it
  through slowly and make sure that we are building these nice clear pathways of dealing with
  these ideas one by one, no? Do you know? Unajua? What. Nini. You want. Unataka. To eat.
  Kula. No? Or maybe more natural Unajua unataka kula nini? So, nini is what, nini. Who is
  nani.
Student: Nani.
Teacher: N-a-n-i, nani, who.
Student: Nani.
Teacher: How would you say Who wants? Who wants? Who wants to? So, who is like he or she, no? He
  wants. Who wants? No? So, how would you say that Who wants?
Student: Anataka nani?
Teacher: Anataka nani? And nani would be much more… I know you put nani on the end because it's
  like a question word, no, like wapi and nini, but nani is also a look like the person. It's like
 
  saying he, who, no? So, you would also find it at the beginning very commonly without
  emphasis in Swahili. Nani anataka? would be the most natural order. Who wants to come?
Student: Nani anataka kuja?
Teacher: Nani anataka kuja? Good. Who wants to know?
Student: Nani anataka kujua?
Teacher: Nani anataka kujua? Who is coming?
Student: Nani anakuja?
Teacher: Very good. Nani anakuja? Who knows? Who knows?
Student: Nani anajua?
Teacher: Nani anajua? And this is also an expression in Swahili like it is in English, no? Who knows?
  Nani anajua? And I should mention that Swahili is spoken quite fast. Also, you’ll notice that
  we have so much information in one word that we might have in four or five words in English,
  no? And that one work has you know just one stress, so, it's spoken quite fast. So, in Swahili
  you should look for, try to home in on the verb and the context. The context, what's going on,
  will give you most of the information about, you know, who is doing what because at the
  beginning especially when you're practicing Swahili you might not hit it, you might just catch
  the verb at the end. But as you practice mode and you listen to Swahili more, Swahili will slow
  down to your ear and you will start hearing all of the little sounds before the verb that show
  who's doing what much more clearly. But at the beginning you might hear for example
  Nananajua. Nani anajua? said very quickly: nanana, nananajua, no? The nani and the ana
  can just blend together to nanana.
Student: Nananajua?
Teacher: Yes, but only if you say it very quickly and very fluidly. So, you’ll notice that it can go very
  fast in Swahili, but, you know, in real life you will hear jua and hear nani, you don't need to
  worry about, you know, whether you’re picking up the na for present, you would get this in the
  context and as you continue the speed of Swahili will slow down to your ear.
 
Swahili Track 13
Teacher: What was to be?
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: Who will be here later?
Student: Nani atakuwa baadae?
Teacher: Here later.
Student: Hapa baadae.
Teacher: Perfect. Who will be here later? Nani atakuwa hapa baadae? So, here is hapa, and around
  here?
Student: Huku.
Teacher: Very good. You just thought about how it starts, no? Huku. Who will be around here later?
  Who will be in the area later?
Student: Nani atakuwa hutu baadae?
Teacher: You were thinking about badaae when you were saying huku. So, you get hutu. So, again
  another thing you want to do is, you know, get used to giving one hundred percent attention just
  to the bit that we’re on. Then we say it, it's been heard, it's been understood, we don't need to
  think about it anymore and we think just about the next bit. Who will be around here later?
  Nani atakuwa huku baadae? You remember what was to see?
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. And the word for thing or something; can be used like something? Think about how it
  begins only.
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: Kitu. So, I want to see something here.
Student: Ninataka kuona kitu hapa.
Teacher: Very good. Ninataka kuona kitu hapa. He wants to see something around here. So, he wants
  to see something around here. What is he wants?
    
Student: Anataka.
Teacher: Anataka. To see.
Student: Kuona kitu huku…
Teacher: And that’s it. Around here, huku. He wants to see something around here. Anataka kuona
  kitu huku. What was the word for what?
Student: Nini.
Teacher: And the word for when?
Student: Lini.
Teacher: When will he see me? When will he see me?
Student: Ananikuona, no. Ataniona. Ataniona lini?
Teacher: Ataniona lini? Very good. Ataniona lini? He will me see when? And what if you wanted to
  trust me? When will you see ME?
Student: Ataniona lini mimi?
Teacher: Good. Ataniona lini mimi? So, the question word likes to be closer to the verb, no? Ataniona
  lini mimi? And also for more emphasis on mimi, we could put it first. Mimi ataniona lini?
  So, the sound for he or she is a, no? That's the sound for he or she. The word for he or she is
  yeye. That's y-e-y-e, yeye.
Student: Yeye.
Teacher: Good. So, this is the same for both he and she. Yeye means he and she. So, it doesn't give any
  more information at all, no? Like before we just use it to be a little more emphatic, when we
  change who we’re talking about or just throw it around where it might feel good, you know?
  So, you should listen up to how Swahili speakers use yeye, mimi, wewe. So, if you want to
  stress he or she and we say When will HE see me? When will SHE see me? We can use yeye.
  So, how would that be?
Student: Yeye ataniona lini?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Yeye ataniona lini? Ataniona lini yeye? I will be here later, and her?
  What is to be?
    
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: I will be here later, and her?
Student: Nitakuwa hapa baadae.
Teacher: Nitakuwa hapa baadae. Or maybe we'd like to say mimi as with contrasting. Mimi nitakuwa
  hapa baadae. And her? And we're making a question. And her?
Student: Je na yeye?
Teacher: Good. but when it's like, and her we won't really interrupt this with je, there at the beginning,
  so, we'll put it at the end.
Student: Na yeye je?
Teacher: Na yeye je? So, this isn't like when je is how and we make it into one word, it's still a separate
  word. Na yeye je? And we said that na also means with, so, for example you could say I will
  be here later with her, no? How would that be?
Student: Nitakuwa hapa baadae na yeye.
Teacher: Exactly, no? Nitakuwa hapa baadae na yeye. She wants to see me. So, let's do the first bit
  first. She wants.
Student: Anataka.
Teacher: Anataka. And now we have to see me. So, based on what you know already about Swahili, if
  you had to make an informed guess on how you would build to see me, what do you think you
  might do?
Student: Kuona mimi?
Teacher: So, this is not based on what you know about Swahili, is it, no? So, based on what you know
  about Swahili, what might you do? So, kuona is to see. What is the sound for me or for I?
Student: Ni.
Teacher: Ni. And how you put them together based on what you already know?
Student: Ni kuona?
Teacher: Which is an informed guess. Ni kuona. But is not like this, it’s kuniona, kuniona.
     
Student: Kuniona.
Teacher: So, the ni goes before the ona like always, no? Our sounds like ni they go before ona, before
  cheka, no, before taka. But here we have to see me, so, we still have the ku as well. Kuniona,
  no? So, there was no reason really for you to get that I just wanted you to think about it based
  on what you know already. So, now as you gave me even though it was wrong it was based on
  what you know, no? The first answer not so much kuona mimi, the second answer yes, but the
  way it is, is kuniona. So, give me that She wants to see me or Does she want to see me?
Student: Je anataka kuniona?
Teacher: Je anataka kuniona? Good. Or just, Anataka kuniona? Does she want to see ME? and we
  emphasize me.
Student: Je anataka kuniona mimi?
Teacher: Very good. So, we repeat the information, no? Kuniona mimi. Je anataka kuniona mimi?
  Good. And let's emphasize she. When, when does she want to see me? She wants to see me
  when?
Student: Yeye anataka kuniona lini? Very good. Yeye anataka kuniona lini? Very good.
Swahili Track 14
Teacher: What was to be?
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: Kuwa. Kwa kuwa. Kwa kuwa, for to be, I mentioned can be used like because. We have kwa
  for for and kuwa for to be. Kwa sababu also means because and it's much more common than
  kwa kuwa. And this means literally something like for reason or for cause. Sababu means
  reason or cause, just like because. Because actually means by cause. So kwa sababu means
  for cause or by cause. Kwa can also be used like by in some situations, kwa sababu.
Student: Kwa sababu.
Teacher: What are the vowels in sababu?
Student: A-a-u.
         
Teacher: A-a-u. Just good to notice it. Kwa sababu. A-a-u. So, this literally means something like for
  or by cause; for or by reason. So, how would you say He will be here later because he wants to
  see me. So, He will be is the first bit.
Student: Atakuwa.
Teacher: Here later.
Student: Hapa baadae.
Teacher: Because he wants to see me.
Student: Kwa sababu atnataka kuniona.
Teacher: Very good. He will be here later because he wants to see me. Atakuwa hapa baadae kwa
  sababu anataka kuniona. And of course, if you forget kwa kuwa you can use kwa kuwa but
  you will hear kwa sababu much more. Kwa nini, kwa nini means why.
Student: Kwa nini.
Teacher: So, that's literally for what, no? And many languages make the word for why in this way: Arabic,
  Greek, Spanish, French, no? So, kwa nini, for what, means why. And thus, kwa nini is for what
  rather than what, nini. We have for what, kwa nini. We don't need to stick it after the verb
  necessarily when we say why something we can start with kwa nini. So, Why are you coming?
Student: Kwa nini unakuja?
Teacher: So, Kwa nini unakuja? might sound like Why do you come? depending on the context. If you
  have context for future would be fine but if you want it to show that this future because in
  English when we say Why are you coming? we mean the future, unless we’re on the phone, no?
  Unless we’re on the phone and somebody says I'm coming. Why are you coming? No? So, Why
  are you coming? and we mean the future.
Student: Kwa nini utakuja?
Teacher: Kwa nini utakuja? Why are you coming? What was to do or to make?
Student: Kufanya.
Teacher: Kufanya. Why are you doing it?
Student: Kwa nini utafanya?
   
Teacher: So, we don't want to get too automatic, no? We want to think about what do we mean. Why are
  you doing it? When you say Why are you doing it? in English most of the time do you mean
  the present or do you mean the future Why will you do it?
Student: Kwa nini unafanya?
Teacher: Kwa nini unafanya? Why are you doing it? Now, no? Why, why are you doing it? Why will
  you do it?
Student: Kwa nini utafanya?
Teacher: Kwa nini utafanya? I want to know why he is doing it and let’s stress he, you know? I want to
  know what HE is doing it. So, I want.
Student: Ninataka.
Teacher: To know.
Student: Kujua.
Teacher: Why.
Student: Kwa nini.
Teacher: He is doing it.
Student: Yeye anafanya.
Teacher: Good. Ninataka; nataka kujua kwa nini yeye anafanya. Or kwa nini anafanya yeye. Good.
  I want to know how he does it. I want to know.
Student: Ninataka kujua.
Teacher: How he does it.
Student: Anafanyaje.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Nataka; ninataka kujua anafanyaje. I want to know how he will do
  it.
Student: Ninataka kujua atafanyaje.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Ninataka kujua anafanyaje. Very good. What was to travel?
Student: Kusafiri.
 
Teacher: Kusafiri. And the word for why or for what.
Student: Kwa nini.
Teacher: Kwa nini. Why do you want to travel around here? So, now we have around here. Why do you
  want to travel around here?
Student: Kwa nini unataka kusafiri huku.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Kwa nini unataka kusafiri huku. No? Why we want to travel around
  here? Kwa nini unataka kusafiri huku. What was to see?
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. Why does he want to see me?
Student: Kwa nini anataka kuniona?
Teacher: Kwa nini anataka kuniona? Good. Why does he want to see me? Do you know, why he wants
  to see me? Do you know?
Student: Unajua kwa nini unataka kuniona?
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Unajua kwa nini anataka kuinona? Good. What was the word for
  what?
Student: Nini.
Teacher: And the word for who?
Student: Nani.
Teacher: Nani. So, we have nini and nani. Give me what again.
Student: Nini.
Teacher: And when?
Student: Lini.
Teacher: So, we have nini and lini. Give me what again.
Student: Nini.
Teacher: And why?
    
Student: Kwa nini.
Teacher: Kwa nini. So, we have nini and kwa nini. So, starting from nini we can find quite a few
  question words. Who will do it?
Student: Atafanya nani?
Teacher: Atafanya nani? or Nani atafanya? Nani is very common first as it's like a person; like yeye
  or mimi, no? Nani atafanya? Who will do it? Who wants to do it?
Student: Nani anataka kufanya?
Teacher: Very good. Nani anataka kufanya. What was the word for what?
Student: Nini.
Teacher: Nini. What will she do? What will she do?
Student: Atafanya nini?
Teacher: Good for changing the position. Atafanya nini? More common to have nini on the end.
  Atafanya nini? Why will she do it?
Student: Kwa nini atafanya?
Teacher: Very good. Kwa nini atafanya? Kwa nini is more common at the beginning but again we have
  a flexibility; or emphasis you could say Atafanya kwa nini? You know? She will do it why?
  but the common unemphatic position Kwa nini atafanya?
Swahili Track 15
Teacher: What was the word for thing or something?
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: Kitu. You just think about how it begins, no? Kitu. Who wants to eat something?
Student: Nani anataka kula kitu?
Teacher: Good. Nani anataka kula kitu? Good. To laugh. What was to laugh?
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. How would you say Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?
       
Student: Kwa nini wewe unacheka?
Teacher: Kwa nini wewe unacheka? Kwa nini unacheka wewe? Why is he laughing at me? And let’s
  user the word for he. Why is he laughing at me?
Student: Kwa nini yeye ananicheka?
Teacher: Good. Kwa nini yeye ananicheka? Kwa is a very flexible word. We've already seen it as for,
  no, like in kwa kuwa; for to be. Kwa can also be used like by in the sense of by bus or by train;
  kwa basi, kwa treni. So, this is maybe what it is also like I mentioned when we say kwa
  sababu, for because. Maybe there it's also by, no? We don't know if it's for reason, for course
  or by reason, by cause; like in English because, no? So, kwa can be for or by in some
  circumstances. By bus, kwa basi.
Student: Kwa basi.
Teacher: Basi. B-a-s-i. Or kwa treni, by train.
Student: Kwa treni.
Teacher: What was to travel?
Student: Kusafiri.
Teacher: Why is she traveling by bus?
Student: Kwa nini anasafiri kwa busi?
Teacher: Basi.
Student: Basi.
Teacher: Good. So, it's with an a, it's written with an A to kind of represent the a sound of u in English
  makes when we say bus, no? So, basi. Why is she traveling by bus? Kwa nini anasafiri kwa
  basi? So, it’s very flexible word is kwa and you will hear it about often. You're going to hear
  kwa all over Swahili doing different things. I will come by bus because I want to sleep. So, I
  will come by bus.
Student: Ninakuja kwa basi.
Teacher: I will come.
Student: Nitakujya.
 
Teacher: The first thing you should do before you start working with a verb is to be sure what is the
  verb. So, you need to say to yourself what is to come, which I often do it for you, but sometimes
  I leave it for you to do, no? So, what is to come?
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. I will come by bus.
Student: Nitakuja kwa basi.
Teacher: Because.
Student: Kwa kuwa. Kwa sababu.
Teacher: Kwa sababu is better. I want to sleep.
Student: Ninataka kulala.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Nitakuja kwa basi kwa sababu ninataka kulala. You can also use
  kwa to say at someone's place, like at someone's house if you use kwa and the name of a person
  you can get at their place. So, for example if I say kwa Aisha, no, it will be at Aisha’s place,
  no? Kwa Aisha. So at Aisha’s place is just for I Aisha or by Aisha. What was to be?
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: Kuwa. I will be at Aisha's place later.
Student: Nitakuwa kwa Aisha baadae.
Teacher: Good. Nitakuwa kwa Aisha baadae. And you could also say I will be with Aisha later. What
  was the word for with?
Student: Na.
Teacher: Na, like present like and. I will be with Aisha later.
Student: Nitakuwa na Aisha baadae.
Teacher: nitakuwa na Aisha baadae. What was the word for today?
Student: Leo.
Teacher: Lwo. Who will be at Aisha's place today?
Student: Nani atakuwa?
    
Teacher: Nani atakuwa? At Aisha’s place.
Student: Kwa Aisha.
Teacher: Today.
Student: Leo.
Teacher: Nani atakuwa kwa Aisha leo? Good. So, Aisha means life. It’s a name but it means life and
  become from Arabic. So, the name carries the meaning of life in Arabic and Swahili also made
  a word out of Aisha, which means life, which is maisha. So, the word got Swahilified a little
  bit. Swahili added an m on the beginning of the name and then Swahili uses maisha for life. So,
  if you wanted, if you wanted to say for life, how would that be?
Student: Kwa maisha.
Teacher: Kwa maisha. But at Aisha’s place.
Student: Kwa Aisha.
Teacher: Kwa Aisha. At whose place? How would you say that?
Student: Kwa nani?
Teacher: Kwa nani? Whose place will you be at later? You will be at whose place later?
Student: Utakuwa kwa nani baadae?
Teacher: Very good. Utakuwa kwa nani baadae? And we will find that the sentence orders are quite
  flexible depending on what we want to stress, no? We could have Kwa nani utakuwa baadae?
  Baadae utakuwa kwa nani? Utakuwa kwa nani baadae? No? There's quite a lot of
  flexibility.
Swahili Track 16
Teacher: The word for town or city in Swahili is mji.
Student: Mji.
Teacher: This is m-j-i. Mji.
Student: Mji.
 
Teacher: So, we want to avoid any temptation to put like a vowel before that m. It's literally starting with
  an m. Mji.
Student: Mji.
  Teacher: So, this means town or city and it also means the town, the city or a town, a city. We don't
     have a word for the or a in Swahili. It was just included there in mji. Do you know the town?
  Student: Unajua mji?
  Teacher: Unajua mji? To see? What is to see?
  Student: Kuona.
  Teacher: Kuona. Do you want to see the town?
  Student: Unataka kuona mji?
  Teacher: Unataka kuona mji? When will you see the town?
  Student: Utaona lini mji?
  Teacher: Very good. Utaona lini mji? So, we have lini, the question word after the verb, generally,
     no? So, mji last. Utaona lini mji? To say in the town, to the town, at the town, all of this we
     can get, by adding a little sound after mji; and this sound is ni, just like the sound for I or
     me, no, ni; but obviously nothing to do with that. So, we've already noticed that in Swahili
     you know, we like to recycle sounds for a lot of things. We have na for the present, for and
     for with and now we have ni for I or me and also, for in, at or to. And we add this onto the
     end of the noun. And we've seen what happens then we add things onto the end of words.
     That it moves the accent, no, like when we add on je, you know. Uasafiri, You travel. How
     do you travel? Unasafirije? It moves the accent. So, if we have mji for town and then we
     want to say in the town, at the town, to the town, and we add ni on the end. How would that
     sound?
  Student: mJIni.
  Teacher: Good. mJIni. Good. So, we have accent on the ji now, no? Mjini. What do you want to see
     in town? What do you want to see in town?
  Student: Unataka kuona nini mjini?
    
  Teacher: Very good. Very good. Unataka kuona nini mjini? Are you coming to town? and we mean
     now, maybe we're on the phone.
  Student: Unakuja mjini?
  Teacher: Unakuja mjini? When are you coming to town?
  Student: Utakuja lini mjini?
  Teacher: Very good. Very good for going to the future there. Utakuja lini mjini? No? When will you
     come to town? Who is coming to town?
  Student: Nani anakuja mjini?
  Teacher: Good. Naji anakuja mjini? Do you know when he will come to town? Do you know when
     he will come to town?
  Student: Unajua lini atakuja mjini?
  Teacher: Good. Unajua lini atakuja mjini? or Unajua atakuja lini mjini? Very good. What was the
     word for today?
  Student: Leo.
  Teacher: Leo. L-e-o. Leo. Do you know how you will come to town today? Do you know how you will
     come to town today? So, what is the first bit you deal with?
  Student: Do you know?
  Teacher: Do you know?
  Student: Unajua?
  Teacher: Unajua? How you will come? You have to deal with all of that together, no? It's one word.
     How you will come?
  Student: Utakujaje?
  Teacher: Good. Do you know how you will come? Unajua utakujaje? Do you know how you will
     come to town today?
  Student: Mjini leo?
  Teacher: Very good. very good. Unajua utakujaje mjini leo? By bus.
    
  Student: Kwa basi.
  Teacher: Kwa basi. By train.
  Student: Kwa treni.
  Teacher: Kwa treni. Very good. The word for coffee in Swahili is kahawa, kahawa.
  Student: Kahawa.
  Teacher: That’s k-a-h-a-w-a, kahawa.
  Student: Kahawa.
  Teacher: So, kahawa and coffee and café and all of that comes from Arabic. In Arabic is kahwa but
     already we see in Swahili that we have the habit of consonant vowel, consonant vowel,
     consonant vowel. So, kahwa becomes kahawa, no? Consonant vowel, consonant vowel. K-
     a-h-a-w-a. Do you want coffee?
  Student: Je unataka kahawa?
  Teacher: Good. Je unataka kahawa? Mkahawa, mkahawa or mgahawa, in some dialects the k gets
     off into a g by the m. Mkahawa or mgahawa means something like the place of coffee.
     Mkahawa.
  Student: Mkahawa.
  Teacher: Which means restaurant. The place of coffee became a general word to refer to restaurants.
     So, how would you say in the restaurant.
  Student: MkahawaNI.
  Teacher: Good, but the accent. If you move the stress it's going to make it easier to say.
  Student: MkahaWAni.
  Teacher: MkahaWAni. What is to eat?
  Student: Kula.
  Teacher: Kula. I want to eat at the restaurant.
  Student: Ninataka kula mkahawani.
 
  Teacher: Good. And what if you wanted to say Me, I want to eat at the restaurant? You know? Putting
     that little emphasis on you.
  Student: Mimi ninataka kula mkahawani.
  Teacher: Very good. Mimi ninataka kula mkahawani. What was the word for thing or something?
     How does it start?
  Student: Kitu.
  Teacher: Kitu. Amazing how that works, no? Do you want to eat something at the restaurant?
  Student: Unataka kula kitu mkahawani?
  Teacher: Good. Good. Do you want to eat something at the restaurant? Unataka kula kitu
     mkahawani? Very good.
Swahili Track 17
Teacher: To say or to speak in some dialects was kusema, kusema.
Student: Kusema.
Teacher: You are saying or in some dialects you are speaking, you speak.
Student: Unasema.
Teacher: Unasema. Why are you speaking? For what are you speaking?
Student: Kwa nini unasema?
Teacher: Kwa nini unasema? What was Swahili in Swahili?
Student: Kuswahili.
Teacher: Kiswahili.
Student: Kiswahili.
Teacher: So, ku we have for verbs, no? Ki is a little sound that means something like language of in this
  case. Kiswahili, language of Swahili, language of the costs, no? Why do you speak Swahili?
  How comes you speak Swahili?
Student: Kwa nini unasema Kiswahili?
    
Teacher: Good. Kwa nini unasema Kiswahili? China was Uchina, you could also just here China. How
  would we say Chinese?
Student: Kichina.
Teacher: Kichina. How comes he speaks Chinese? Why does he speak Chinese?
Student: Kwa nini anasema Kichina?
Teacher: Kwa nini anasema Kichina? What was the word for for?
Student: Kwa.
Teacher: Kwa. To say in Swahili, you say kwa Kiswahili, in Chinese you say kwa Kichina, in English?
Student: Kwa Kiingereza.
Teacher: Kwa Kiingereza. Very good. So, kwa here probably means by actually: by Swahili, by English
  because this is the way Arabic does it. In Arabic you say by English, no? So, maybe this is a
  habit from there. So, we've seen kwa as by as in kwa basi, by bus; kwa sababu, by cause,
  because. So, again kwa as by kwa Kiswahili, by Swahili, in Swahili. What was to come?
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. And to know?
Student: Kujua.
Teacher: So, kujua, kujua is to know or to know. So, if we follow that by a true form like Do you know
  how to speak? then we don't need that how. We have kujua, which is to know, to know how and
  then to speak. Do you know how to speak English?
Student: Unajua kusema Kiingereza?
Teacher: Good. Unajua kusema Kiingereza? And as I mentioned before kusema will sound quite
  strange for to speak in some dialects of Swahili, where kuongea would be preferred for to speak
  although kusema is always to say, no? So, using kuongea how would you say I speak Swahili.
Student: Ninaongea Kiswahili.
Teacher: Ninaongea Kiswahili. Naongea Kiswahili. I’m mentioning some differences between the
  dialects and sometimes this by the frightened some learners, you know, like What does this
  mean I need to memorize all the differences in the dialects? and no, of course not, even native
    
  speakers are very surprised to find the differences in different dialects of their own language
  and things that sound very strange to them. So, just listen and when you notice people around
  you using a different work to you then change and pick it up, pick up the verb they are using,
  no? Maybe this is a mistake that you correct for your listening or maybe this is just a dialect
  preference that you are using that is different somewhere else and you can always just kind of
  adjust your speech to mirror what you hear around you. What was at Aisha’s place?
Student: Kwa Aisha.
Teacher: Kwa Aisha. And this name means life, Aisha. And we can get the word for life from Aisha.
Student: Maisha.
Teacher: Maisha. So, Swahili put an m on it to get the meaning life, on this Arabic word. So, just how
  verbs in their standard form in Swahili begin with a k-u, no, kula, kulala, kusafiri. Nouns,
  words we put the or a in front of in English at least, no, because we don't have these words in
  Swahili, the town, the life, the restaurant also tend to start in one of a few ways. Like with an
  m for example. We saw mji, maisha, mkahawa, no, the coffee place, the restaurant. We have
  these nouns starting m. Or with ki, we've seen nouns starting ki, k-i, like the word for thing.
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: Kitu. Or like languages Chinese.
Student: Kichina.
Teacher: Kichina. What was to laugh?
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. So, this is a verb and it starts with ku but we also have the noun a laugh or laughter,
  kicheko, kicheko.
Student: Kicheko.
Teacher: Kicheko. So, we notice, we can notice the nouns, words we can put the or a in front of in
  English mostly, the life, the coffee, the thing, tend to start in one of a few ways in Swahili. Like
  with an m: mji, mkahawa or like with a ki: kitu, kicheko. The word for book or a book or the
  book is kitabu, kitabu.
  
Student: Kitabu.
Teacher: So, when we come across a new noun, we can check if it begins with something familiar to us,
  no? So, we come across this new noun, we look up in the dictionary book, we find kitabu and
  we go: Oh another one starting key, no? And we just process the vocabulary that we come
  across in this way, which is really helpful for our memory. Again, we're not trying to memorize,
  just noticing. Kitabu, Oh a ki one, okey. How is he or she wants?
Student: Anataka.
Teacher: Anataka. She wants the book.
Student: Anataka kitabu.
Teacher: Anataka kitabu. And kitabu is spelled k-i-t-a-b-u. They want is wanataka, wanataka.
Student: Wanataka.
Teacher: So, what is the sound for they?
Student: Wa.
Teacher: Wa. They is the plural of he and she. That's not very obvious in English because he and she
  looks so different to they, but if you think two he’s, is they; two she’s is they. So, they is the
  plural of he or she, which is why a and wa sound so similar. So, we get a for he or she and wa
  for they. So, they in the present is.
Student: Wana.
Teacher: Wana. And in the future?
Student: Wata.
Teacher: Wata. They want the book.
Student: Wanataka kitabu.
Teacher: Wanataka kitabu. They will want the book.
Student: Watataka kitabu.
Teacher: Watataka kitabu. They want coffee.
Student: Wanataka kahawa.
Teacher: Wanataka kahawa. Coffee is a noun, no? We can have the coffee or a coffee. Does it start with
  something familiar to us? Kahawa. Not familiar with us, no? We were seeing a ki, so this one
  doesn't. But what was restaurant?
Student: Mkahawa.
Teacher: Mkahawa. And this one is familiar to us, no, this beginning. What other nouns start like this?
Student: Mji.
Teacher: Mji. No? Another place starting m. We said that mkahawa is like the place of coffee, no? Mji
  a town or a city. Very good.
Swahili Track 18
Teacher: So, what was to come in Swahili?
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. And to know?
Student: Kujua.
Teacher: Kujua. Does he know?
Student: Je anajua?
Teacher: Very good. Anajua? Je anajua? Do they know?
Student: Wanajua?
Teacher: Very good. Wanajua? Do they know English?
Student: Wanajua Kiingereza?
Teacher: How do they know English?
Student: Wanajuaje Kiingereza?
Teacher: Very good. Wanajuaje Kiingereza? Wanajuaje Kiingereza? Very good. So, how do they
  know all one word: wanajuaje. What was the word for when?
Student: Lini.
Teacher: When will they know? When will they know?
  
Student: Watajua lini?
Teacher: Very good. Watajua lini? When will they come?
Student: Watakuja lini?
Teacher: Good. Watakuja lini. Good. What was to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: Kulala. And word for town or city; or the town, the city; a town, a city?
Student: Mji.
Teacher: Mji. In the town, to town, at the town.
Student: Mjini.
Teacher: Mjini. Very good. So, we add on this ni and then the accent moves as well when we add on a
  syllable. So, we have the stress on m, mji and then mjini, in the town, at the town, to the town.
  They will sleep in town.
Student: Watalala mjini.
Teacher: Good. Watalala mjini. They will eat in town.
Student: Watakula mjini.
Teacher: Very good. Watakula mjini. What was the word for coffee?
Student: Kahawa.
Teacher: Kahawa. And the word for a restaurant?
Student: Mkahawa.
Teacher: Mkahawa. And this can also be heard and written with a g sound. Mgahawa. Depending on
  the dialect the m might soften the k of kahawa. So, mkahawa or mgahawa. So, that's
  restaurant. The word for night is usiku, usiku.
Student: Usiku.
Teacher: What was word for today?
Student: Leo.
   
Teacher: Leo. Good. Tonight is usiku wa leo. Usiku wa leo.
Student: Usiku wa leo.
Teacher: Which literally means night of today. Usiku wa leo. That's quite a mouthful, no? Usiku wa leo.
  And in spoken Swahili it would be shortened to leo usiku. So, today night, no, literally like
  tonight, leo usiku; but writing you will see it usiku wa leo.
Student: Usiku wa leo.
Teacher: But in spoken?
Student: Leo usiku.
Teacher: Leo usiku. Good. So, They will eat in the restaurant tonight. So, don't hold on to tonight. Think
  about it again when we get there. So, They will eat at the restaurant tonight.
Student: Watakula mkahawa leo usiku.
Teacher: I think you were holding on to tonight which is why you said they would eat the restaurant. So,
  mkahawa is the restaurant and how do you say in the restaurant?
Student: Mkahawani. Watakula mkahawani leo usiku.
Teacher: Good. Watakula mkahawani, we will move the accent, no, when we put the ni. Watakula
  mkahawani leo usiku or usiku wa leo. Good. They will eat in the restaurant in town tonight.
Student: Watakula mkahawani mjini leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good.Watakula mkahawani mjini leo usiku. Good. They will come to town by train
  tonight. They will come.
Student: Watakuja.
Teacher: Watakuja. To town.
Student: Mjini.
Teacher: By train.
Student: Kwa treni.
Teacher: Tonight.
Student: Leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good. Watakuja mjini kwa treni leo usiku. To love or to like is kupenda, kupenda.
Student: Kupenda.
Teacher: How do you think penda is spelt?
Student: P-e-n-d-a.
Teacher: P-e-n-d-a. Kupenda. Just to like or to love. How would you say I like or I love.
Student: Ninapenda.
Teacher: Ninapenda. I love to eat.
Student: Ninapenda kula.
Teacher: Ninapenda kula. A lot or very much is sana, s-n-s-a, sana.
Student: Sana.
Teacher: So, if you wanted to say I like to eat very much; I like to eat a lot.
Student: Ninapenda kula sana.
Teacher: Very good. Ninapenda kula sana. What is you like or you love?
Student: Unapenda.
Teacher: Unapenda. You like me; you love me.
Student: Unanipenda.
Teacher: Unanipenda. Good. He or she likes or loves.
Student: Anapenda.
Teacher: Anapenda. They like.
Student: Wanapenda.
Teacher: Wanapenda. They like to travel a lot.
Student: Wanapenda kusafiri sana.
Teacher: Good. Wanapenda kusafiri sana. And it’s flexible, no? Maybe you would say: Wanapenda
   sana kusafiri. It's flexible. Wa other than the sound for they, is also the sound for them. So, wa
 
  means they end them. So, if we say for example: he likes them; he loves them. How would that
  be?
Student: Anawapenda.
Teacher: Anawapenda. Good. I like them.
Student: Ninawapenda.
Teacher: Ninawapenda. They like me.
Student: Wananipenda.
Teacher: Wananipenda. Good. They like them, one group likes another group.
Student: Wanawapenda.
Teacher: Very good. Wanawapenda. What was to laugh?
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. You're laughing.
Student: Unacheka.
Teacher: You're laughing at them.
Student: Unawacheka.
Teacher: Unawacheka. He's laughing at them.
Student: Anawacheka.
Teacher: Anawacheka. Very good. So, what was to eat?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: To come.
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. To be.
Student: Kuwa.
  
Teacher: Kuwa. So, we have these verbs that just have ku and then one syllable, no, and then they keep
  their ku when we start building with them most of the time. Another verb like this is kunywa,
  which means to drink. Kunywa.
Student: Kunywa.
Teacher: Good. That's spelt k-u-n-y-w-a. Nywa.
Student: Nywa.
Teacher: Think about each letter separately n-y-w-a. Nywa.
Student: Nywa.
Teacher: Kunywa.
Student: Kunywa.
Teacher: How many syllables does nywa have?
Student: One.
Teacher: Just one, no? So, if you say: I'm drinking.
Student: Ninakunywa.
Teacher: Ninakunywa. You keep the ku. Very good. Ninakunywa. Ninakunywa. You drink.
Student: Unakunywa.
Teacher: Unakunywa. Do you drink coffee? Are you drinking coffee?
Student: Je unakunywa kahawa?
Teacher: Very good. Je unakunywa kahawa? Are they drinking coffee? Do they drink coffee?
Student: Je wanakunywa kahawa?
Teacher: Very good. Je wanakunywa kahawa? Do they want to drink coffee in the restaurant? Do they
  want to drink coffee in the restaurant?
Student: Wanataka kunywa kahawa mkahawani?
Teacher: It's very important to move the accent when you put the ni there.
Student: Mkahawani.
    
Teacher: Good, because then the accent draws your attention to the fact that you have that change in
  meaning as much as the ni does, no? So, mkahawa, mkaHAwani you don't really hear it very
  much but mkahaWAni already, even before you hear the ni, you hear the accent moves so,
  you're waiting for something else, no? So that’s really important. Do they want to drink coffee
  in the restaurant? Wanataka kunywa kahawa mkahawani? How do we say tonight?
Student: Leo usiku.
Teacher: Leo usiku. So, I mentioned before that, when we have a lot of vowels, maybe a word is a harder
  to remember, no? So, here we start with a vowel and we finished with a vowel: u-si-ku. It's
  quite easy to get these vowels mixed up. So, we can just process that by asking ourselves what
  other vowels in usiki? U-i-u. And the vowel sound, no? U-i-u, okey usiku. What was the word
  for thing, also used like something? How does it begin?
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: They will drink something in town tonight. So, They will drink.
Student: Watakunywa
Teacher: Something.
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: In town tonight.
Student: Mjini leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good. They will drink something in town tonight. Watakunywa kitu mjini leo usiku.
  Very good.
Swahili Track 19
Teacher: What was to drink?
Student: Kunywa.
Teacher: Kunywa. Nya. K-u-n-y-w-a.
Student: Kunywa.
Teacher: Good. The word for house is nyumba, nyumba.
    
Student: Nyumba.
Teacher: N-y-u-m-b-a. So, again we have this n-y sound starting a syllable, ny, nyumba, like in nywa
  but here is slightly easier nyumba, house.
Student: Nyumba.
Teacher: How would you say at the house.
Student: Nyumbani.
Teacher: Nyumbani. Good. Nyumbani. So, this can be at the house or even at home, no, in the right
  context. They will drink something at home tonight for example. How would that be They will
  drink something at home tonight.
Student: Watakunywa kitu nyumbani leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Watakunywa kitu nyumbani leo usiku. Very good. So, They will
  drink something a home tonight and I will be in town. So, how would we say that bit: and I will
  be in town.
Student: Na mimi nitakuwa mjini.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Na mimi nitakuwa mjini. And na mimi can contract to nami. So, we
  could have Nami nitakuwa mjini. Nami for and me. The word they is wao, w-a-o. Wao.
Student: Wao.
Teacher: W-a-o. So, we have the sound wa for they or them and the word for they or them is while wao,
  w-a-o. I want to drink something at home with them. So, I want to drink something at home with
  them.
Student: Ninataka kunywa kitu nyumbani na wao.
Teacher: Ninataka or nataka kunywa kitu nyumbani na wao. And I mentioned before that na can
  contract like na mimi can contract to nami and na wao contracts to nao, n-a-o. Nao for na
  wao. And you should listen out generally for contractions like these in Swahili. What was to
  say or to speak.
Student: Kusema.
Teacher: Kusema. Good. Do they speak Swahili? And let’s use the word they. Do they speak Swahili?
    
Student: Wao, wanasema Kiswahili?
Teacher: Very good. Wao, wanasema Kiswahili? Do they speak English?
Student: Wao, wanasema Kiingereza?
Teacher: Very good. Wao, wanasema Kiingereza? So, we have kusema which to say or to speak. To
  read is kusoma, kusoma, s-o-m-a, kusoma.
Student: Kusoma.
Teacher: So, I'm reading.
Student: Ninasoma.
Teacher: Ninasoma. What was the word for house or home sometimes?
Student: Nyumba.
Teacher: Nyumba. Very good. I will read at home later.
Student: Nitasoma nyumbani baadae.
Teacher: Very good, Very good. Nitasoma nyumbani baadae. Good. What was the word for what?
Student: Nini.
Teacher: Nini. Very good. What will they read? They, what will they read? How would that be?
Student: Wao, watasoma nini?
Teacher: Good. Wao watasoma nini. Very good. Kusoma, other than to read can also mean to study.
  So, this could mean What will they study? Watasoma nini? What was the word for where?
Student: Wapi.
Teacher: Wapi. So, how would you say: Where are they reading? or Where are they studying?
Student: Wanasoma wapi?
Teacher: Wanasoma wapi? What is word for thing?
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: Kitu. Good. And Swahili?
Student: Kiswahili.

Teacher: Kiswahili. English?
Student: Kiingereza.
Teacher: Kiingereza. Book, the book or a book was kitabu, kitabu.
Student: Kitabu.
Teacher: So, again beginning ki, k-i and kitabu is another word of Arabic origin. If you speak Turkish,
  Persian or even some in some Greek dialects and other languages you will find a similar word
  for book. What is to say or to speak?
Student: Kusema.
Teacher: Kusema. And to read and in some contexts to study?
Student: Kusoma.
Teacher: Kusoma. Good. I will read a book at home tonight. You can make the same order is in English
  but, you know, you should listen to Swahili word order because it's quite flexible and you can
  move things around with different emphasis, but for now we can use exactly same models
  English. So, I will read a book at home tonight.
Student: Nitasoma kitabu nyumbani leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Nitasoma nyumbani leo usiku. How would you say read like you’re
  giving the order: read.
Student: Soma.
Teacher: Soma. Read a book.

Teacher: Tunapenda kitabu. We are reading a book.
Student: Tunasoma kitabu.
Teacher: Very good. Tunasoma kitabu. And we understand the difference between a book and the book
  by the context. Tu, other than the sound for we is also the sound for us. So, if we want to say:
  They like us we can use tu. So, how would that be? They like us.
     
Student: Wanatupenda.
Teacher: Wanatupenda. And what if we were to use the word for they?
Student: Wao, wanatupenda.
Teacher: Good. Wao, wanatupenda. Good. And, We like them.
Student: Tunawapenda.
Teacher: Tunawapenda. Good. And to see, what was to see?
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. They see us.
Student: Wanatuona.
Teacher: Good. Wanatuona. Wao, wanatuaona. And, We see them.
Student: Tunawaona.
Teacher: Good. Tunawaona. Very good. We see them.
Swahili Track 20
Teacher: What does to know?
Student: Kujua.
Teacher: Kujua. Good. And, We know them.
Student: Tunawajua.
Teacher: Very good. Tunawajua. They know us.
Student: Wanatujua.
Teacher: Very good. Wanatujua or wao wanatujua. Good. How do they know us?
Student: Wanatujuaje?
Teacher: Very good. Wanatujuaje? Good. How do they know us? All one word. So, we saw that we
  have ni for I or me; we have u for you; wa for they or them; tu for we or us and a for he or she
  but not him or her. Him or her, the sound for him or her is mu.
  
Student: Mu.
Teacher: Mu. But when it comes before the consonant the u is lost, so, we just get an m, m. So, if we say
  I like him or her because penda begins with a consonant, we won't have mu for him or her just
  an m. So, I like him or her.
Student: Ninampenda.
Teacher: Ninampenda. Good. and it would come together, no? We won't stop to say nina-m-penda,
  ninampenda. Very good. So, we have a for he or she and mu for him or her. And this mu
  would become just a m, m before a consonant sound. The word for he or she was yeye.
Student: Yeye.
Teacher: So, yeye is also the word for him or her. The word is the same he, she, him, her: yeye. So, if
  you wanted to say: I like him; I like her stressing that him or her.
Student: Yeye ninampenda.
Teacher: You could put yeye first, no, for extra emphasiStudent: Yeye ninampenda but more naturally on the
  end: Ninapenda yeye. Nibampenda yeye. What was the word for a lot; very much?
Student: Sana.
Teacher: Sana. They like him or her a lot.
Student: Wanampenda sana.
Teacher: Wanampenda sana. Good. And, We like her a lot.
S. Tunampenda sana.
Teacher: Tunampenda sana. Good, and if we were to stress her.
Student: Tunampenda sana yeye.
Teacher: Good. Tunampenda sana yeye. How would you say: He knows me.
Student: Ananijua.
Teacher: Ananijua. So, this could mean: He knows me. She knows me. How about, He knows her.
Student: Anamjua.
 
Teacher: Anamjua. Good. So, this could mean: He knows her, He knows him, She knows her, She knows
  him, no? It could mean any of that. Anamjua. And if we add yeye we don't get any more
  information because yeye means he or she, him or her. How does he know her? How does she
  know her? How does she know him? Etc.
Student: Anamjuaje?
Teacher: Anamjuaje. Good. So, for he or she we get a and for him or her mu but as we've seen the u is
  lost before a consonant and we left just with m like in ninampenda, ninamjua. What was to
  laugh?
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. And why or for what.
Student: Kwa nini.
Teacher: Kwa nini. Good. Why are you laughing at him?
Student: Kwa nini unamcheka?
Teacher: Kwa nini unamcheka? Kwa nini unamcheka yeye? So, before a consonant the mu for him
  or her becomes m just an m but before a vow the u of mu can become a w. So, it may stay as
  mu or it might become mw. And whether you hear this or not, may really depend on the dialect.
  So, we could have either mu or mw before a vowel. What was to see?
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. And, what is the bit meaning see?
Student: Ona.
Teacher: Ona. And this starts with a vowel, no? So, if we say: I see him or I see her.
Student: Ninamwona.
Teacher: Good. Ninamuona or ninamwona. We will see him at home tonight. We will see him at home
  tonight.
Student: Tutamuona nuymbani leo usiku.
   
Teacher: Very good. We will see him, at home; in the house tonight. Tutamwona, very good for using
  the future but we could also use the present there as we have some context. So, we could say
  tutamuona or tunamuona nyumbani leo usiku. So, what was the word for today?
Student: Leo.
Teacher: Leo. And tonight was?
Student: Leo usiku.
Teacher: Leo usiku, no, in spoken, otherwise writing will say usiku wa leo, the night of today, but in
  spoken, to shorten it, leo usiku. The word for tomorrow is kesho, kesho.
Student: Kesho.
Teacher: K-e-s-h-o. Kesho.
Student: Kesho.
Teacher: That's tomorrow. Will you see them tomorrow?
Student: Utawaona kesho?
Teacher: Utawaona kesho? Utawaona kesho? Will you see him tomorrow?
Student: Utamuona kesho?
Teacher: Very good. Utamuona kesho? Utamuona kesho? Tomorrow night is usiku wa kesho in more
  efficient Swahili. Usiku wa kesho, night of tomorrow or in spoken, more colloquial Swahili
  just kesho usiku.
Student: Kesho usiku.
Teacher: So, They will see us tomorrow night. They will see us tomorrow night.
Student: Watatuona kesho usiku.
Teacher: Watatuona kesho usiku. Very good.
Swahili Track 21
Teacher: What was the word for today?
Student: Leo.

Teacher: Leo. And tonight?
Student: Leo usiku.
Teacher: Leo usiku. Tomorrow?
Student: Kesho.
Teacher: Kesho. Tomorrow night?
Student: Kesho usiku.
Teacher: Kesho usiku. What was the sound for we or us?
Student: Tu.
Teacher: Tu. The word for we or us is sisi. S-i-s-i. Sisi.
Student: Sisi.
Teacher: So, that doesn’t look like the sound we have for we or us, no? Tu, sisi, the word for we or us.
   What was to drink?
Student: Kunywa.
Teacher: Kunywa. K-u-n-y-w-a. Kunywa. Do you want to drink something with us tomorrow night? So,
   Do you want?
Student: Unataka?
Teacher: Unataka? To drink.
Student: Kunywa.
Teacher: Kunywa. Something.
Student: Kitu.
Teacher: Kitu. With us.
Student: Na sisi.
Teacher: Tomorrow night.
Student: Kesho usiku.
    
Teacher: Very good. Very Good. Do you want to drink something with us tomorrow night? Unataka
  kunywa kitu na sisi kesho usiku? We want to eat in the restaurant tonight. And let’s use the
  word for we. We want to eat in the restaurant tonight.
Student: Sisi tunataka kula mkahawani leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Sisi tunataka kula mkahawani leo usiku. What was to see?
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. Does he see us?
Student: Je anatuona?
Teacher: Je anatuona? And let’s use the word for us. Does he see us?
Student: Sisi anatuaona?
Teacher: So, you could put sisi first, no? Sisi anatuona? But that would be especially enfatic, no, because
  sisi here is us rather than we. So, you could put it there but you would have to show it with your
  voice, you know? SISI anatuona? To show you’re not making a mistake, otherwise more
  naturally it would be on the end.
Student: Je anatuona sisi?
Teacher: Good. Anatuona sisi? Je anatuona sisi? Good. We will see him tonight. And let’s stress we
  and him using the word for we and him. We will see him tonight.
Student: Sisi tutamuona yeye.
Teacher: Tonight.
Student: Leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good. Very good. Sisi tutamuona yeye leo usiku. We will see him tonight. We will be at
  home tonight. Where will they be? So, We will be at home tonight.
Student: Tutakuwa nyumbani leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good. We will be at home tonight. Tutakuwa nyumbani leo usiku. Where will they be?
  So, we can say: They, where will they be?
Student: Wao watakuwa wapi?
   
Teacher: Very good. Wao watakuwa wapi? And we could just say: And they? and make it a question.
Student: Na wao.
Teacher: Na wao. And make it a question.
Student: Na wao je?
Teacher: Na wao je? Good. We will be at home tonight with them.
Student: Tutakuwa nyumbani leo usiku na wao, nao.
Teacher: Good. We will be at home tonight with them. Tutakuwa nyumbani leo usiku nao or na wao.
  And, as I mentioned, the order is quite flexible, so, you should listen out to whatever dialect of
  Swahili you are practicing with to see what are the preferred orders, no? We could also have,
  for example: Tutakuwa nao nyumbani leo usiku. Tutakuwa nyumbani nao leo usiku. So,
  we saw how ni is I or me, wa is they or them, tu means we or us, he or she is a and him or her,
  we have a change, we have mu. We also have two sounds for you. In You see, for example, we
  have u. What is you see?
Student: Unaona.
Teacher: Unaona. But in I see you, the sound for you is ku. K-u. Ku.
Student: Ku.
Teacher: Ku. So, it’s not news to us, no, by now, that Swahili likes to recycle sounds, no? We’ve seen
  na for the present, for and and for with; we’ve seen ni for the sound for I and also like in or at
  and now we see ku for you as in I see you rather than you see and of course we’ve seen ku until
  now as to, no, as in to sleep, to laugh. So, what is to see?
Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. You see.
Student: Unaona.
Teacher: Unaona. Do you se me?
Student: Je unaniona?
Teacher: Good. Je unaniona? But I see you there we don’t have u for you anymore but ku. So, how is
  thiStudent: I se you.
  
Student: Ninakuona.
Teacher: Ninakuona. So, in listening we must be careful not to confuse this kuona with to see, no? This
   is I, present, you, see. Ninakuona. So, now we need to open our minds to the idea that when
   we hear ku it’s not just to, no? It could be you. How would you say I want to see you.
Student: Ninataka kukuona.
Teacher: Yes. Ninataka kukuona. No? So, we get the two kus together but which is which? Which ku
   refers to to and which ku refers to you in kukuona?
Student: First one for you and then kuona.
Teacher: How was to see me?
Student: Ah no. Second one is for you.
Teacher: Yes. So, just to run through it at loud. What was to see me?
Student: Kuniona.
Teacher: Kuniona. No? Kuniona. So, yes in kukuona second ku is the you, no? Good. I want to see
   you. Nataka; ninataka kukuona. What was to laugh?
Student: Kucheka.
Teacher: Kucheka. He’s laughing at you.
Student: Anakucheka.
Teacher: Anakucheka. They are laughing at you.
Student: Wanakucheka.
Teacher: Wanakucheka. I know you.
Student: Mimi ninakujua.
Teacher: Very good. Mimi ninakujua. We know you. Stressing we. The word for we doesn’t sound like
   tu.
Student: Sisi.
Teacher: Very good. Sisi. We know you.
    
Student: Sisi tunakujua.
Teacher: We know you. Sisi tunakujua. And, he knows you.
Student: Yeye anakujua.
Teacher: Good. He knows you. Yeye anakujua. And how would you say: he knows you emphasizing
   you.
Student: Anakujua wewe.
Teacher: Good. Anakujua wewe. So far, we’ve seen the na sound for present and the ta sound for the
   future. To make a sentence in the past, I laught for example, it’s just as simple. We have a sound
   for the past, which is li. L-i. Li.
Student: Li.
Teacher: So, I in the past sounds like.
Student: Nili.
Teacher: Nili. You in the past.
Student: Uli.
Teacher: Uli. He or she in the past.
Student: Ali.
Teacher: Ali. They.
Student: Wali.
Teacher: Wali. And we in the past.
Student: Tuli.
Teacher: Tuli. I laught.
Student: Nilicheka.
Teacher: Nilicheka. He laught; she laught.
Student: Alicheka.
   
Teacher: Alicheka. He laught at you.
Student: Alikucheka.
Teacher: Alikucheka. I laught at you.
Student: Nilikucheka.
Teacher: Nilikucheka. You laught.
Student: Ulicheka.
Teacher: Ulicheka. Good. You laught. Ulicheka. Did you laugh?
Student: Je ulicheka?
Teacher: So, there is a big change there in English between: You laught and Did you laugh, no? But not
  in Swahili. You laught. Ulicheka. Did you laugh? Ulicheka? Je ulicheka? Did you laugh at
  him?
Student: Ulimcheka?
Teacher: Ulimcheka? Very good. Je ulimcheka?
Swahili Track 22
Teacher: What was to say or to speak?
Student: Kusema.
Teacher: Kusema. What did you say?
Student: Ulisema nini?
Teacher: Ulisema nini? What was to read?
Student: Kusoma.
Teacher: Kusoma. What did you read?
Student: Ulisoma nini?
Teacher: Ulisoma nini? And the word for book.
Student: Kitabu.
Teacher: Kitabu. Good. I read the book or I read a book.
Student: Nilisoma kitabu.
Teacher: Nilisoma kitabu. What was the word for house?
Student: Nyumba.
Teacher: Nyumba. Good. We read a book at home.
Student: Tulisoma kitabu nyumbani.
Teacher: Very good. Tulisoma kitabu nyumbani. The word for what.
Student: Nini.
Teacher: Nini. And when.
Student: Lini.
Teacher: Lini. Very good. When did they read it? And this it doesn't refer to an object or the book it
  refers to, you know, the news, that, this thing happened or whatever, you know? When did they
  read it? And this it we don't translate it.
Student: Tuli…
Teacher: When did they.
Student: Walisoma lini?
Teacher: Walisoma lini? No? Walisoma lini? When did they read? When did they read it? But if we
  say: When did they read it? and we mean the book, we refer to a specific object, no? We have
  a word for it. Just as we have different sounds for people in Swahili: ni, u, a, wa, tu, no? In
  Swahili, there are many different sounds for things too, rather than one bored it that refers to all
  things, like in English. We've already noticed that nouns in Swahili start in different ways. With
  an m: like in mji town, maisha life, mkahawa restaurant; or with a ki: like in kitu thing, kitabu
  book, Kiswahili Swahili. So, when we say it referring to a ki noun, for example, we just take
  the beginning of kitabu, kitu, etc, ki and that's it. That’s our word for it, ki. But only when we
  referring to one of these ki nouns, like: kitabu, kitu… So, if you say: When did they read it?
  and you mean the book, the word for it is ki. So, how would that be? When did they read it?
  And we mean the book.
Student: Walikisoma lini?
Teacher: Very good. Walikisoma lini? No? Walikisoma lini? Very good. What was to like or love?
Student: Kupenda.
Teacher: Kupenda. Did they like it? And this it doesn't refer to any object. So, like: Did they like it? the
  weekend you spent together?
Student: Walipenda?
Teacher: Walipenda? Did they like it? And we mean the book.
Student: Walikipenda?
Teacher: Walikipenda? To buy in Swahili is kununua. Kununua.
Student: Kununua.
Teacher: So, let's talk our way through this, no? We have a repeated syllable no, nunu and then our a
  that most of our verbs n Swahili end with. Nunua. Kununua. To buy.
Student: Kununua.
Teacher: I bought a book.
Student: Nilinunua kitabu.
Teacher: Very good. Nilinunua kitabu. I bought it and we mean the book.
Student: Nilikinunua.
Teacher: Very good. Nilikinunua. Nilikinunua. I bought it in town.
Student: Nilikinunua mjini.
Teacher: Very good. Nilikinunua mjini. So, as I mentioned we have different sounds for it. So, this it ki
  is only to refer to nouns beginning ki. I bought it in town. Nilikinunua mjini. I bought the book
  in town.
Student: Nilinunua kitabu mjini.
Teacher: Very good. Nilinunua kitabu mjini. And I should mention you might also hear the information
  repeated as well but it's totally optional. Nilikinunua kitabu. So, you know, we could include
 
  the it for kitabu even though we say kitabu, but we don't have to. Nilikinunua kitabu or
  nilinunua kitabu mjini. So, ki is it for nouns beginning ki. What was tonight?
Student: Leo usiku.
Teacher: Leo usiku. I bought a book in town today because I want to read it at home tonight. So, I bought
  a book in town today.
Student: Nilinunua kitabu mjini leo.
Teacher: Very good. Nilinunua kitabu mjini leo or nilikinunua kitabu mjini leo. Because.
Student: Kwa kuwa.
Teacher: Kwa kuwa. Or maybe more common. A bit better than kwa kuwa is.
Student: Kwa sabanu.
Teacher: Sababu.
Student: Sababu.
Teacher: Good. Kwa sababu. Or kwa kuwa, no? Either are fine. I want to read it at home tonight. And
  what does this it refers to: I want to read it.
Student: The book.
Teacher: The book. So…
Student: Ninataka kikusoma.
Teacher: What was to see me.
Student: Kuniona.
Teacher: Kuniona. So, to read it is.
Student: Kukisoma.
Teacher: Kukisoma. No? So, we moved the ku of to read and the ki goes next to the base of that verb:
  soma, no? To it read, kukisoma. At home.
Student: Nyumbani.
Teacher: Nyumbani. Tonight.
Student: Leo usiku.
Teacher: Very good. So, all together: I bought a book in town today because I want to read it at home
  tonight. Nilinunua kitabu mjini leo kwa sababu nataka or ninataka kukisoma nyumbani
  leo usiku. What was the word for tomorrow? So you remember?
Student: Kesho.
Teacher: Kesho. And to do, to make.
Student: Kufanya.
Teacher: Kufanya. I did it today because I want to get out; I want to go out; I want to get out tomorrow.
  So, I did it today.
Student: Nilifanya leo.
Teacher: Good. Nilifanya leo. And this it we don't translate it because: I did it, is an action; it's not a
  thing. So, nilifanya leo, because.
Student: Kwa sababu.
Teacher: Kwa sababu, kwa kuwa. I want to get out tomorrow.
Student: Ninataka kutoka kesho.
Teacher: I did it today because I want to get out tomorrow. Nilifanya leo kwa sababu nataka, ninataka
  kutoka kesho. So, kesho is tomorrow and tomorrow night.
Student: Kesho usiku.
Teacher: Kesho usiku. Good. I will do it tomorrow night because tonight, I will drink something with
  her. So, I will do it tomorrow night.
Student: Nitafanya kesho usiku.
Teacher: Good. I will do it tomorrow night. Nitafanya kesho usiku. Because.
Student: Kwa sababu.
Teacher: Kwa sababu. Tonight, I will drink something with her.
Student: Leo usiku, nitakunywa kitu na yeye.
    
Teacher: Very good. I will do it tomorrow night because tonight, I will drink something with her.
  Nitafanya kesho usiku kwa sababu leo usiku, nitakunywa kitu na yeye.

Teacher: Nilikuwa hapa jana usiku. Where were you?

Teacher: Ulikuwa wapi? And what if we wanted to emphasize you? Where were you last night?

Student: Kuona.
Teacher: Kuona. Hotel or the hotel or a hotel is hoteli. Hoteli.
Student: Hoteli.
Teacher: Hoteli.
Student: Hoteli.
Teacher: How would you say in the hotel?
Student: Hotelini.
Teacher: Very good. And you move the accent as well hotelini. Very good. Did you see them in the hotel
  yesterday? So, the first bit iStudent: Did you see them? You saw them? So, what's the first bit of
  information you have to deal with? You saw them? Did you see them?
Student: Did you.
Teacher: Yeah. Or just: You saw them? No?
Student: Uliwaona?
Teacher: Very good. Uliwaona? So, it’s just that, you know, we have an idea with many elements and
  we just think where do we begin. So, Did you see them in the hotel yesterday? Did you see
  them? You past them saw, no? Uliwaona? In the hotel yesterday.
Student: Hotelini jana.
Teacher: Good. Did you see them in the hotel yesterday? Uliwaona hotelini jana? Did you see us
  yesterday night, last night? Did you see us last night?
Student: Ulituona jana usiku?
Teacher: Very good. Ulituona jana usiku? Ulituona jana usiku? I saw you in town. I saw you in town.
Student: Nilimwana.
Teacher: That would be: I saw him or her. So, we have u for you in: You see and I see you. What do we
  get for you? A sound we recycle from somewhere else.
    
Student: Ku.
Teacher: Ku. So, I saw you in town.
Student: Nilikuona mjini.
Teacher: That's it. Nilikuona mjini. What was to buy? We had a repeated syllable in to buy.
Student: Kununua.
Teacher: Kununua. Very good. We bought the book in town. We bought the book in town.
Student: Tulinunua kitabu mjini.
Teacher: Very good. Tulinunua kitabu mjini. And we could repeat the information as well. We could
  say: We bought it, the book in town. You will also hear that in Swahili. Tulikinunua kitabu
  mjini. Tulikinunua kitabu mjini. We bought it in town. And we mean the book.
Student: Tulikinunua mjini.
Teacher: Tulikinunua mjini. Where did they buy it? And we still mean the book. Where did they buy
  it?
Student: Walikinunua wapi?
Teacher: Walikinunua wapi? Very good. So, we have na for present, no? We've seen and na also for
  and; and also for with. How do you say: with who?
Student: Na nani?
Teacher: Na nani. Good. Who was he with? So, we will say: He was with who? He was with who?
Student: Alikuwa na nani?
Teacher: Alikuwa na nani? Very good. So, what is to be?
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: Kuwa. To express to have in Swahili, interestingly, there's no verb to express this concept of
  possession in the same way we do in English. In Swahili, instead of saying to have we say to
  be with. Kuwa na. So, kuwa na, to be with is used like to have. So, if you want to say: I will
  have the book, you will say: I will be with the book; I had the book, I was with the book. So,
  what is I was from kuwa.
    
Student: Nilikuwa.
Teacher: Nilikuwa. I had to book yesterday. I was with the book yesterday.
Student: Nilikuwa na kitabu jana.
Teacher: Very good. Nilikuwa na kitabu jana. What was the word for house or home?
Student: Nyumba.
Teacher: Nyumba. I had a house in town. I was with a house in town.
Student: Nilikuwa na nyumba mjini.
Teacher: Nilikuwa na nyumba mjini. Good. The word for car in Swahili is gari. Gari.
Student: Gari.
Teacher: It's just the English word but the c has been softened to a g and we get an i on the end. So, car,
  gari. G-a-r-i. Will they have the car today?
Student: Tutakuwa na gari leo?
Teacher: Okay. You said perfectly: Will we have the car today? Will they have the car today?
Student: Watakuwa na gari leo?
Teacher: Good. So, it's useful also to notice if you have a recording error and try to figure out why? So,
  you do this quite a bit I think, mixing the they and the we. But if you just notice why it happens?
  Why do you think it might happen?
Student: I don’t know.
Teacher: They are the two plural ones, no? So, there's some subconscious connection, no? So, if we
  realize that, we go, okay we just have to take one microsecond more to make sure we didn't get
  the wrong one there and we will sort that out. So, Will they have the car today? Watakuwa na
  gari leo? No, they had the car yesterday. The word for no was hapana, hapana.
Student: Hapana.
Teacher: So: No, they had the car yesterday.
Student: Hapana, wao walikuwa na gari jana.
 
Teacher: Hapana, wao walikuwa na gari jana. We will have the car today. We, and let's use the word
  for we, we will have the car today.
Student: Sisi tutakuwa na gari leo.
Teacher: Very good. Sisi tutakuwa na gari leo. Very good.
Swahili Track 24
Teacher: Did you watch the Lion King?
Student: Yes.
Teacher: So, you heard Hakuna Matata?
Student: Yes.
Teacher: Did you know it was Swahili?
Student: I saw it on Wikipedia.
Y: Ah yeah? When you are researching the course we would do? Okay. So, hakuna matata means
  there is no trouble, there is no trouble. We can learn a lot from this phrase. Firstly, the words
  for trouble which is matata, and hakuna, which means there isn't or there aren’t. And this
  word, hakuna is what we can learn the most from. If we get rid of ha for example, if we get rid
  of ha from hakuna, how would it sound?
Student: Kuna.
Teacher: Kuna. And this means there is or there are. So, we learned that ha, in fact, is the negative.
  Actually, like in hapana the word for no. That ha of hapana is the same ha. So, we have kuna
  for there is or there are and hakuna, like in hakuna matata, there isn't, there aren't. So, how
  would you say: There is a train.
Student: Kuna treni.
Teacher: Kuna treni. There isn't a train. There are no trains.
Student: Hakuna treni.
Teacher: Hakuna treni. There's no buses.
  
Student: Hakuna basi.
Teacher: Hakuna basi. There is no bus. Hakuna basi. She is traveling by bus because there are no trains
  today. So, she is traveling by bus.
Student: Anasafiri kwa basi.
Teacher: Very good. Kwa basi for by bus. Anasafiri kwa basi. Because.
Student: Kwa kuwa.
Teacher: Kwa kuwa. Kwa sababu. There are no trains today.
Student: Hakuna treni leo.
Teacher: She's traveling by bus because there are no trains today. Anasafiri kwa basi kwa sababu
  hakuna treni leo. So, we have kuna and hakun, no? Kuna looks like a to verb, no? Kuna, but
  it isn't. What was to be?
Student: Kuwa.
Teacher: Kuwa. And to have or to be with?
Student: Kuwa na.
Teacher: Kuwa na. And what was the word for here?
Student: Hapa.
Teacher: Hapa. And the word for around here?
Student: Huku.
Teacher: Huku. Good. So, kuna actually means around here has. What we say to express this idea of
  there is or there are is around here has. So, hapa literally means this precise place or something
  like that and huku literally means this around place. So, ku from huku and na from kuwa na,
  we join them together and we get kuna meaning something like around here has. Kuna. So,
  it's quite a similar way of expressing the idea of there exists now that we have in English when
  we say there is. It's a complicated thing to express it in many languages and many likely to do
  this a little bit strangely. In German, for example, to say there is or there are you say it gives, it
  gives, no? So, this is quite the strange concept to express in many languages there is, there are
  and in Swahili we do it like this kuna, around here has. You will also use this there is, there
         
   isn't for some things you wouldn't do so far in English. For example, if you want to say it's cold,
   like the weather, you will say there is cold, rather than it is cold. So, what was there is?
Student: Kuna.
Teacher: Kuna. The word for code is baridi, baridi.
Student: Baridi.
Teacher: B-a-r-i-d-i. Baridi.
Student: Baridi.
Teacher: Baridi, which is an Arabic word, bard, it means cold, but again, we swahilified, consonant
   vowel, consonant vowel, consonant vowel. Baridi. So, it's cold we will just say there is cold.
Student: Kuna baridi.
Teacher: Kuna baridi. Around here has cold. What if you wanted to say: It is cold around here.
Student: Huku kuna baridi.
Teacher: Huku kuna baridi. So, the ku of huku and the ku of kuna is the same ku. In the same way, if
   you want to say: It is hot, you will say: There is heat. Heat is joto. J-o-t-o.
Student: Joto.
Teacher: Joto. It is hot here. Here, there is heat.
Student: Hapa kuna joto.
Teacher: Hapa kuna joto. It is hot around. Around here, there is heat.
Student: Huku kuna joto.
Teacher: Huku kuna joto. It's not hot, it's cold. So, it's not hot. There isn't heat.
Student: Hakuna joto, kuna baridi.
Teacher: Very good. No, just thinking about how it starts and we get it. Baridi. So, Hakuna joto, kuna
   baridi. I will be at home today because it's hot. I will be at home today because it's hot. I will
   be.
Student: Nitakuwa mjini.
  
Teacher: At home today.
Student: Nyumbani leo.
Teacher: Because it's hot.
Student: Kwa sababu kuna joto.
Teacher: Very good. I will be at home today because it's hot. Nitakuwa nyumbani leo kwa sababu
   kuna joto. Very or a lot, we said was sana. So, if you want to say: It's very hot you say: There
   is heat a lot.
Student: Kuna joto sana.
Teacher: Kuna joto sana. Good. We will be at home today because it's very hot in town. We will be at
   home today because it's very hot in town. So, the first bit iStudent: We will be at home today.
Student: Tutakuwa nyumbani leo.
Teacher: Tutakuwa nyumbani leo. Because.
Student: Kwa sababu.
Teacher: It's very hot in town.
Student: Kuna joto sana mjini.
Teacher: Very good. We will be at home today because it's very hot in town. Tutakuwa nyumbani leo
   kwa sababu kuna joto sana mjini.
Swahili Track 25
Teacher: So, what was there isn't or they aren't as in there's no trouble.
Student: Hakuna.
Teacher: Hakuna. And there is or there are.
Student: Kuna.
Teacher: Kuna. Hakuna nad kuna also let us see on how to have works in the present, which is a little
   odd. We've already seen how we literally say to be with when we say to have and we've seen to
   have in the past and the future not in the present yet. Well we've seen it in the present only in
  
  kuna, no? Kuna is a present construction of to have, around here has, kuna. And to have
  always works like this in the present. So, I have is just nina. I with, nina.
Student: Nina.
Teacher: Nina or mimi nina or mi nina for short. So, you have would be.
Student: Una.
Teacher: We have.
Student: Tuna.
Teacher: Tuna. He/she has.
Student: Ana.
Teacher: They have.
Student: Wana.
Teacher: Wana. So, although, generally we use the structure kuwa na to talk about possession, like in
  the past or the future, for example, in the present, we have this shortcut ninna, una, tuna, etc.
  So, I have a car.
Student: Nina gari.
Teacher: Nina gari. We have a car.
Student: Tuna gari.
Teacher: Tuna gari. How might we don't have be? So, if kuna is there is and hakuna is there isn't.
  Tuna, we have and we don't have.
Student: Hatuna.
Teacher: Hatuna. We don't have a car.
Student: Hatuna gari.
Teacher: Hatuna gari. They don't have a car.
Student: Hawana gari.
Teacher: Hawana gari. They had a car. So, then we go back to the longer: They were with have a car,
  no? So, they had a car.
Student: Walikuwa na gari.
Teacher: Walikuwa na gari. We, and let's use the word for we, We will have the car later.
Student: Sisi tutakuwa na gari baadae.
Teacher: Good, but you pronounce kuwa na like it's one word. So, I just want to clarify that it's two.
  Kuwa na and there you have like kind of two different stresses, no? TutaKUwa NA GAri
  rather than tutakuWAna. What is the word for tomorrow?
Student: Kesho.
Teacher: Kesho. We will have the car tomorrow.
Student: Tutakuwa na gari kesho.
Teacher: Good. Tutakuwa na gari kesho. If we want to say: we won't have the car tomorrow then, what
  might we add to that?
Student: Hatuta.
Teacher: Good. So, you add ha, no? So, starting ha we have the negative, like in kuna, there is; hakuna,
  there isn't. So, we will not be with the car tomorrow.
Student: Hatutakuwa na gari kesho.
Teacher: Good. Hatutakuwa is all one word, no, which is part of what makes my he live fast, that you
  get these long words with one stress on them. So, Hatutakuwa, hatutakuwa, hatutakuwa na
  gari kesho. What was to buy?
Student: Kununua.
Teacher: Kununua. I want to buy the car. I want to buy a car.
Student: Ninataka kununua gari.
Teacher: Ninataka kununua gari. Nataka kununua gari. We want to buy a car.
Student: Tunataka kununua gari.
Teacher: Good. Tunataka kununua gari. We will buy a car.
    
Student: Tutanunua gari.
Teacher: Tutanunua gari. We won't buy a car.
Student: Hatutanunua gari.
Teacher: Hatutanunua. Hatutanunua. When you put it fluently, no, you have hatutanunua.
  Hatutanunua gari. So, like I mentioned before Swahili, at the beginning especially, you want
  to just try to pick up the key information you can and the context, using the context to help
  understand what's going on and the more Swahili you here the slower it will become to your
  ear. And the more you think about any Swahili you expose yourself to and try to work out what's
  going on, beyond whether you really understand what's being said or not, you know,
  recognizing pieces that you know and thinking about them, then the language will slow down
  to the ear. What is to come?
Student: Kuja.
Teacher: Kuja. We will come by car.
Student: Tutakuja gari.
Teacher: By car.
Student: Kwa gari.
Teacher: Tutakuja kwa gari. We won't come by car we’ll come by train.
Student: Hatutakuja kwa gari.
Teacher: We’ll come by train.
Student: Tutakuja kwa treni.
Teacher: We won't come by car we’ll come by train. Hatutakuja kwa gari, tutakuja kwa treni. Very
  good.
