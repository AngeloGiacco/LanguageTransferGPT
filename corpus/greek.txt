General	approach:	Transliteration	is	provided	at	the	first	appearance	of	a	phrase,	but	this	
is	 not	 generally	 repeated	 for	 nearby	 subsequent	 occurrences.	 If	 a	 phrase	 reappears	
further	 into	 the	 transcript	 (e.g.,	 a	 following	 track),	 transliteration	 is	 generally	 repeated	
there.	 The	 model	 is	 based	 on	 English	 pronunciation,	 with	 the	 sound	 indicated	 in	 square	
brackets,	e.g.,	[af].	Word	stress	is	shown	as	in	Greek,	by	an	accent	mark,	e.g.,	γιατί	[yatí].

Complete	Greek,	Track	01	–	Language	Transfer	
	
Welcome	 to	 the	 all-new	 and	 re-mastered	 Complete	 Greek.	 For	 those	 of	 you	 that	
don’t	 know,	 the	 Language	 Transfer	 project	 came	 to	 life	 in	 the	 divided	 capital	 of	
Cyprus,	Nicosia,	where	I,	Mihalis,	the	founder	of	this	project,	began	to	make	courses	
in	 Greek	 and	 Turkish,	 to	 help	 unite	 the	 divided	 island	 of	 Cyprus.	 Five	 years	 on,	 the	
methodology	has	grown	immeasurably,	which	is	why	I	wanted	to	re-master	and	re-
record	 the	 Greek	 course,	 including	 in	 this	 course	 all	 of	 the	 developments	 in	 the	
methodology	which	have	occurred	over	these	past	four	or	five	years.	If	you	already	
started	the	previous	Greek	courses	that	were	online,	you	should	still	start	this	course	
from	the	beginning.	Although	a	lot	of	the	material	or	the	content	will	be	familiar	to	
you,	the	outlook	will	be	very	different.	This	is	a	journey	that’s	worth	taking	right	from	
the	beginning	again.	This	new	course	will	also	address	reading	and	writing	in	Greek.		
	
Now	for	those	of	you	that	are	not	familiar	with	this	way	of	learning,	you’re	about	to	
experience	a	new,	although	extremely	natural	way	of	learning,	that	might	make	you	
question	how	you	were	taught	to	learn	and	the	relationship	you	were	made	to	have	
with	learning	and	with	information	in	most	of	our	industrialised	education	systems.	
During	this	course	you	will	learn	a	great	amount	of	Greek	and	a	great	amount	about	
language.	You	will	become	your	own	teacher,	able	to	analyse	the	language	that	you	
encounter	around	you,	and	to	use	that	to	improve	and	to	fill	out	your	Greek.		
	
This	 course	 will	 be	 recorded	 with	 various	 volunteer	 students,	 whilst	 the	 LT	 project	
travels	 around	 Europe,	 developing	 Complete	 Greek	 and	 Complete	 German	 in	 open	
public	workshops.	So	this	course	represents	a	real	live	learning	experience,	which	is	
edited	for	your	use.		
	
During	the	course,	I’ll	explain	something	about	Greek	and	how	it	works;	then	I’ll	ask	
you	to	build	a	sentence	from	what	I’ve	explained.	It’s	extremely	important	that	you	
pause,	relax,	take	your	time	to	think	through	your	sentence,	and	to	say	it	out	loud.	
You	 may	 feel	 a	 voice	 or	 an	 impulse	 trying	 to	 force	 you	 to	 spit	 out	 your	 answer	
quickly,	 and	 that’s	 probably	 left	 over	 from	 school.	 We	 don’t	 care	 about	 quick	
answers,	and	we	definitely	don’t	want	automatic	and	memorised	answers.	What	we	
want	to	do	here	is	to	take	our	time	to	think	through	our	sentence,	piece	it	together,	
and	 then	 say	 it	 out	 loud;	 and	 then	 un-pause	 and	 listen	 to	 the	 follow-up	 –	 you	 will	
hear	the	student’s	response	and	my	reply.		
	
It’s	 very	 important	 also	 that	 you	 don’t	 try	 to	 memorise	 during	 the	 course.	 You	 will	
exercise	 everything	 that	 you	 are	 learning	 through	 the	 sentences	 that	 you	 are	
creating,	and	nothing	else.	All	you	need	to	worry	about	is	building	those	sentences,	
and	concentrating	and	engaging	actively	with	the	audio,	following	the	explanations	
and	 forming	 your	 own	 sentences.	 Enjoy	 the	 thinking	 process;	 enjoy	 building	 your	
sentence.	It’s	this	very	thinking	process	that	is	installing	Greek	in	your	mind.	It’s	the	
thinking	process,	not	the	answer,	that	is	the	most	important	part	of	our	experience	
together.	 We	 will	 think	 slowly	 to	 learn	 quickly.	 Don’t	 try	 to	 actively	 memorise;	 of	
course,	you	need	to	remember,	but	not	through	memorisation.	Memorisation	is	the	
most	inefficient	way	to	remember.	We	will	do	many	other	things	to	make	sure	that	


                                                                                                 6
we	remember	what	we	learn	together.	Just	listen	and	make	sure	you	understand	the	
explanations;	 don’t	 worry	 about	 memorising.	 Memorisation	 is	 distracting,	 stressful,	
and	very	much	inhibits	our	learning	process.	Don’t	worry	about	remembering	words;	
some	 you	 will	 forget,	 and	 that’s	 normal	 and	 expected.	 There	 will	 be	 many	 tips	
throughout	the	course	on	how	to	find	what	you	think	you	may	have	forgotten.		
	
Don’t	write!	I	know	it’s	very	tempting	to	write.	The	structure	we	create	together	in	
our	minds	is	not	very	easy	to	reproduce	on	paper.	Doing	so,	or	trying	to	do	so,	will	be	
very	unhelpful.	If	you	write	words	or	structures	down	that	we	see	during	the	course,	
you	will	be	denying	yourself	of	certain	mental	processes	that	are	required	for	you	to	
find	and	use	those	structures.	What	that	means	is	that	piece	of	paper	that	you	write	
down	on,	acts	something	like	an	external	brain	cell.	When	you	don’t	have	that,	you	
might	find	it	quite	difficult	to	speak	Greek.	So	please,	do	not	write.	You	can	visualise,	
that’s	fine,	and	you	will	be	helped	in	your	visualisation,	as	I	describe	throughout	the	
course	 how	 letters	 look	 in	 Greek.	 But	 please	 don’t	 write;	 it	 really	 does	 change	
everything,	 and	 all	 of	 the	 mental	 processes	 that	 are	 necessary	 for	 us	 to	 learn	 a	
language	 in	 this	 exciting,	 exhilarating,	 and	 liberating	 way.	 This	 doesn’t	 mean	 to	
demonise	writing	generally.	Reading	and	writing	in	a	language	that	you	are	learning	
is	a	very	good	practice.		
	
As	you	can	understand	by	now,	this	course	is	not	something	you	should	have	in	the	
background.	 It	 should	 be	 something	 that	 you	 engage	 with	 actively,	 when	 you	 have	
energy	to	think,	to	concentrate,	and	to	follow	the	explanations	that	are	being	given.	
Try	to	find	a	time	in	your	day	where	you	have	both	the	calmness	and	the	energy	to	
relax	and	engage	in	this	time	that	is	for	you.	Do	as	much	of	the	course	as	what	feels	
exciting,	and	then	take	a	break.	When	you	start	to	get	tired,	when	you	make	careless	
mistakes,	 it’s	 time	 to	 take	 a	 break.	 There’s	 no	 reason	 to	 push	 yourself	 or	 to	 force	
yourself;	 learning	 is	 not	 about	 pain.	 Learning	 is	 about	 satiating	 curiosity,	 about	
having	 fun.	 Also,	 10	 to	 20	 minutes	 a	 day	 is	 much	 better	 than	 four	 or	 five	 hours	
crammed	 over	 the	 weekend.	 So	 just	 an	 audio	 or	 two	 a	 day	 will	 have	 a	 profound	
effect.		
	
The	 most	 important	 thing	 I	 can	 tell	 you	 is	 not	 to	 just	 listen	 and	 follow	 the	 audio.	
Always	 pause,	 think	 through	 your	 own	 answer	 before	 hearing	 the	 volunteer	
student’s	reply,	and	then	continue.	If	you	don’t	do	this,	everything	will	make	sense	
what	 you’re	 listening	 to,	 you	 will	 follow	 and	 it	 will	 be	 logical,	 but	 you	 will	 not	 be	
having	 your	 own	 learning	 experience.	 You	 will	 only	 be	 witnessing	 somebody	 else’s	
learning	experience.	The	learning	experience	is	in	the	thinking,	so	you	must	do	that	
yourself	 before	 you	 hear	 the	 volunteer	 student’s	 reply.	 If	 it’s	 been	 a	 while	 since	
you’ve	engaged	in	active	learning,	don’t	worry;	you	will	feel	your	concentration	span	
increase	 very	 rapidly.	 It’s	 also	 not	 necessary	 to	 memorise	 this	 advice;	 it	 will	 be	
revisited	constantly	during	the	course.		
	
As	I	mentioned,	the	Language	Transfer	project	started	in	Cyprus,	and	since	then	the	
project	has	grown	beyond	my	wildest	dreams,	thanks	to	the	users.	The	LT	project	so	
far	 is	 not	 an	 organisation;	 let’s	 say	 it	 is	 just	 the	 fruit	 of	 the	 collaboration	 between	
myself	and	you,	the	users	of	Language	Transfer.	The	project	is	growing,	and	it	would	


                                                                                                    7
be	impossible	without	both	the	volunteer	collaborations	of	Language	Transfer	users,	
and	 the	 financial	 support.	 The	 Language	 Transfer	 project	 is	 independent,	
unsponsored,	 unaffiliated,	 unfunded.	 This	 means	 that	 I	 maintain	 the	 freedom	 to	
create	the	best	and	most	profound	learning	experiences,	without	having	to	appease	
the	promotional	desires	of	funders,	for	example.	If	you	love	this	course	and	the	way	
the	work	is	realised	with	the	Language	Transfer	project,	please	consider	joining	the	
Patreon	 Campaign	 –	 Patreon,	 that’s	 PATREON.com,	 patreon.com/languagetransfer,	
which	 is	 a	 monthly	 crowd	 funding	 campaign	 to	 help	 keep	 me	 in	 the	 freedom	 to	
continue	giving	what	I	love	to	give	freely.	So	please	help	support	and	shape	Language	
Transfer,	joining	the	Patreon	Campaign	where,	with	your	donation,	you	can	also	vote	
for	the	next	language	course	to	be	created	with	the	Thinking	Method.	Or,	of	course	
you	 can	 make	 an	 occasional	 donation	 through	 the	 website,

T:		Μένω.	 So	 this	 is	 I	 stay	 or	 I’m	 staying.	 It	 covers	 both	 in	 Greek.	 You	 may	 have	
    noticed	that	two	words	are	becoming	one	here.	We	don’t	need	to	say	the	word	
    for	“I”	in	Greek;	that’s	included	in	μένω.	Actually,	it’s	that	[o]	(ω)	on	the	end	that’s	
    showing	us	that	it’s	“I”	–	I	stay,	I’m	staying.	So	μένω	is,	I	stay	or	I	am	staying.		
	
	 You	will	notice	that	most	Greek	words	are	built	of	parts,	and	a	lot	of	these	parts	
    we	already	know	them	from	English,	although	we	may	not	realise	that	we	know	
    them.	 For	 example,	 in	 English	 we	 have	 the	 word	 perimeter,	 we	 have	 the	 word	
    period,	 periphery	 –	 this	 “peri”	 that	 we	 have	 in	 perimeter,	 period,	 periphery,	
    means	around	or	near,	in	Greek.		
	
	 If	we	stick	that	to	the	beginning	of	μένω	–	so	we	said	that	μένω	means	I	stay	or	
    I’m	staying	–	if	we	stick	this	“peri”	to	the	beginning	of	that,	firstly	how	would	it	
    sound,	if	we	stick	peri	(περι)	to	μένω	[méno]?	
	
S:		Περιμένω	[periméno].		
	
T:		Περιμένω,	good.	So	περιμένω,	“around	stay”,	means,	I	wait	or,	I’m	waiting.		
	
S:		Περιμένω.		
	
T:		Περιμένω.	So	tell	me	again,	what	is,	I	stay	or	I’m	staying?		
	
S:		Μένω.		
	
T:		Μένω,	good.	And,	I	wait	or	I’m	waiting,	or	I’m	around	staying?	
	
S:		Περιμένω.		
	
T:		Περιμένω,	good.	The	word	for	don’t	or	not	in	Greek	is,	δεν	[dhen].		
	
S:		Δεν.		
	
T:		This	 is	 spelt	 with	 δέλτα	 [dhélta],	 the	 Greek	 letter	 that	 looks	 like	 a	 d	 (δ),	 or	 in	
    capitals	it	looks	like	a	triangle	(Δ).	Δεν/δεν.		
	
S:		Δεν.		
	
T:		So	this	is	like	the	TH	sound	in	the	English	word	“then”,	like,	I	came	then	I	saw	him;	
    it’s	 the	 same	 sound.	 So	 in	 Greek,	 we’re	 writing	 this	 sound	 with	 the	 letter	 δέλτα	


                                                                                                    9
   (δ),	which	looks	like	a	D/d,	but	we	shouldn’t	let	that	confuse	us.	We	can	just	look	
   back	to	the	English	word,	“then”,	and	import	the	sound	right	over	into	Greek.	It’s	
   the	same	sound.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	I	don’t	stay	or,	I’m	not	staying,	you	can	just	
   put	that	first,	that	δεν	[dhen]	before	the	verb.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:		Δεν	μένω	[dhen	méno].		
	
T:		Δεν	μένω,	good.	And	I’m	not	waiting	or,	I	don’t	wait?		
	
S:		Δεν	περιμένω	[dhen	periméno].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	δεν	περιμένω.		
	
	 This	[o]	sound	with	verbs,	words	like	μένω,	περιμένω,	that	shows	us	that	it’s	“I”,	is	
    written	with	a	letter	that	looks	like	a	“w”	when	it’s	small	(ω),	or	something	like	a	
    rounded	tophat	in	capitals	(Ω).	This	is	the	letter	ωμέγα	[omégha].	You	don’t	have	
    to	worry	about	remembering	the	letter	names	or	even	how	the	letters	look.	I’m	
    just	mentioning	them	in	case	you	are	exposing	yourself	to	written	Greek.		
	
	 In	 fact,	 vowels	 were	 not	 previously	 written	 in	 the	 script	 that	 became	 the	 Greek	
    and	 the	 Latin	 script,	 and	 [o]	 was	 adapted	 from	 “w”	 in	 English.	 So	 we	 see	 that	
    connection	there	with	this	letter	in	Greek	that	looks	like	a	W	and	produces	an	[o]	
    sound	 –	 the	 letter,	 ωμέγα	 [omégha].	 Ωμέγα.	 In	 other	 scripts,	 such	 as	 Arabic	 for	
    example,	we	also	see	this	connection,	where	W	and	O	is	actually	the	same	letter.	
    Arabic,	Greek,	Latin	–	the	English	script	–	they	all	come	from	the	same	root,	they	
    all	 come	 from	 the	 same	 parent	 script.	 So	 this	 [o]	 sound	 like	 in	 μένω	 [méno]	 or	
    περιμένω	 [periméno],	 looks	 like	 a	 “w”	 in	 Greek.	 So	 give	 me	 again,	 I	 stay	 or,	 I‘m	
    staying.		
	
S:		Μένω.		
	
T:		Μένω,	good.	And	I	wait	or,	I’m	waiting.		
	
S:		Περιμένω.		
	
T:		Περιμένω.	So	we	see	that	this	[o]	or	this	w-letter	shows	us	that	it’s	“I”.	If	we	want	
    to	make,	He	stays	or,	He	is	staying,	She	stays/she	is	staying,	It	stays/it	is	staying,	
    we	 change	 this	 [o]	 sound	 to	 an	 [i]	 sound,	 then	 we	 get	 the	 version	 of	 the	 verb	
    which	works	for	he,	she	or	it.	How	would	that	sound?		
	
S:		Μένει	[méni].		
	
T:		Μένει,	 brilliant,	 μένει.	 So	 μένει	 gives	 us,	 he	 stays,	 he’s	 staying,	 she	 stays,	 she’s	
    staying	or,	it	stays,	it’s	staying	–	all	of	that	with	μένει.	He	waits	or,	She	waits?		
	
S:		Περιμένει	[periméni].		
	


                                                                                                  10
T:		Περιμένει.	She	isn’t	waiting?		
	
S:		Δεν	περιμένει	[dhen	periméni].		
	
T:		Δεν	περιμένει.	Very	good.		
	
	 Now,	if	you	want	to	make	it	a	question	–	Is	she	waiting?	Is	he	waiting?	–	we	do	
    something	that	in	English	will	form	the	question,	we	invert	the	“is”	and	the	“he”:	
    She	is	waiting	–	Is	she	waiting?	He	is	waiting	–	Is	he	waiting?	But	you	don’t	have	to	
    worry	 about	 that	 in	 Greek.	 In	 Greek,	 all	 you	 need	 to	 do	 to	 make	 a	 question	 is	
    make	it	sound	like	a	question.	So,	if	you	want	to	say,	Is	he	waiting?	Is	she	waiting?	
    how	would	that	be?		
	
S:		Περιμένει;	[periméni?].		
	
T:		That’s	it.	Περιμένει;	Isn’t	she	waiting?		
	
S:		Δεν	περιμένει;	[dhen	periméni?].		
	
T:		Δεν	περιμένει;	Good.	The	word	for	“me”	in	Greek	is	the	same	as	in	English;	you	
    just	pronounce	it	more	like	how	it’s	written,	με	[me].	Με.		
	
S:		Με.	
	
T:		So	that’s	“me”.	If	you	want	to	say,	He’s	waiting	for	me,	firstly	we	don’t	need	the	
    for,	we	will	say	something	like,	He’s	awaiting	me,	She’s	awaiting	me,	and	that	me,	
    that	 με	 [me],	 is	 going	 to	 come	 before	 the	 verb,	 it’s	 going	 to	 come	 first.	 So	 how	
    would	you	say	that,	He	is	waiting	for	me,	She	is	waiting	for	me.		
	
S:		Με	περιμένει	[me	periméni].		
	
T:		Very	good,	με	περιμένει.	She’s	not	waiting	for	me.	So	this	με	[me]	wants	to	come	
    just	before	the	verb.	What	will	come	first	is	the	not.	So,	Not	she	is	waiting	for	me/	
    he	is	waiting	for	me.		
	
S:		Δεν	με	περιμένει	[dhen	me	periméni].		
	
T:		Very	good,	δεν	με	περιμένει.	Isn’t	she	waiting	for	me?	Isn’t	he	waiting	for	me?	
	
S:		Δεν	με	περιμένει;	[dhen	me	periméni?].		
	
T:		Δεν	με	περιμένει;	Well	done.

T:	 Μένω,	good.	And,	He	stays,	she	stays,	it	stays.		
	
S:	 Μένει	[méni].		
	
T:	 Μένει.	Good.	So	we	change	the	[o]	sound	to	an	[i]	sound	and	we	get	he,	she,	or	it.	
    How	about,	He’s	not	staying?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μένει	[dhen	méni].

T:	 Περιμένω.	Very	good.	And,	He	waits,	She	waits?		
	
S:	 Περιμένει	[periméni].		
	
T:	 Περιμένει.	Very	good.	The	word	for,	where	in	Greek	is	πού	[pu].	Πού.

T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	Where	does	he	stay?	Where	does	she	stay?	Or,	Where	is

T:	 Very	good.	Πού	με	περιμένει;	This	[i]	sound	with	the	verbs	that	gives	us,	he,	she,

    otherwise	 known	 as	 έψιλον	 [épsilon]	 and	 γιώτα	 [yóta],	 together	 (ει).	 So	 E	 and	 I	
    together	 in	 Greek	 gives	 us	 [i].	 So	 there’s	 a	 few	 ways	 of	 writing	 the	 [i]	 sound	 in

S:	 Δεν	περιμένει	[dhen	periméni].		
	
T:	 Δεν	περιμένει,	very	good.	We’ve	seen	how	περιμένω,	for	example,	is	μένω,	I	stay,	
    with	 this	 extra	 περι	 [peri]	 at	 the	 beginning,	 which	 means	 around,	 giving	 us	 the	
    meaning	 of	 wait:	 I	 around	 stay,	 I	 stay	 around,	 I	 wait.	 And	 we	 found	 this	 peri	 in	
    English.	 It’s	 not	 something	 we	 need	 to	 memorise	 or	 worry	 about	 remembering.	
    We	have	it	there	in	English	–	period,	periphery,	etc.		
	
	 We	can	look	back	at	English	again	and	find	another	word-building	element	used	in	
    Greek.	In	English,	we	have	the	words,	episode,	epiphany,	epicentre.	This	epi	means	
    something	like,	on.	So	epicentre,	no,	is	the	strongest	point	of	an	earthquake,	for	
    example	–	it’s	on	the	centre.	So	how	would	it	sound	if	we	built,	On	stay?	Firstly,	
    how	would	that	sound?		
	
S:	 Επιμένω	[epiméno].		
	
T:	 Επιμένω,	επιμένω.	So	επιμένω	means	I	insist.	So	in	Greek,	to	stay	on,	I	stay	on,	I	
    insist	–	επιμένω.		
	
S:	 Επιμένω.		
	
T:	 I’m	not	insisting,	I	don’t	insist.		
	
S:	 Δεν	επιμένω	[dhen	epiméno].

S:	 Επιμένει	[epiméni].

    and	then	having	the	equivalent	pop	into	your	mind.	It’s	about	thinking,	“Oh,	how	
    did	we	find	that?”	Just	starting	that	chain	of	thought,	relaxed,	most	of	the	time	is	
    going	to	take	you	to	the	word.	So	we	just	want	to	go,	for	insist,	for	example.	Now	
    what	was	insist,	now	what	did	it	relate	to?	So,	what	do	we	start	with?

S:	 Γιατί	δεν	με	περιμένει;	[yatí	den	me	periméni?].		
	
T:	 And	the	sound	of	δεν	[dhen]	is	like	the	soft	TH	that	we	have	in	English,	like	in	the	
    English	 word	 “then”.	 No?	 We	 shouldn’t	 get	 confused	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 this	 letter	
    looks	like	a	D,	and	that	we	might	visualise	it	in	that	way	as	well.	We	can	just	think	
    of	the	English	sound,	“then”.

    languages.	You	have	por	meaning	“because	of”,	or	“for”,	and	then	qué,	meaning

    we’re	 not	 translating	 it,	 no?	 Tι	 περιμένεις;	 What	 are	 you	 awaiting?	 Are	 you	
    waiting	for	me?	Are	you	waiting	for	me?		
	
S:	 Με	περιμένεις;	[me	periménis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Με	περιμένεις;	Aren’t	you	waiting	for	me?		
	
S:	 Δεν	με	περιμένεις;	[dhen	me	periménis?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	με	περιμένεις;		
	
	 Let’s	learn	a	new	verb.	The	verb	for	“I	do”	or	“I	make”,	is	κάνω	[káno].	Κάνω.		
	
S:	 Κάνω.		
	
T:	 Like,	Κ-Α-Ν-Ο,	and	of	course	this	is	the	o,	the	[o]	that’s	showing	that	it’s	“I”	with	
    the	 verbs,	 so	 it’s	 going	 to	 look	 like	 that	 letter	 which	 is	 a	 “w”	 (ω),	 the	 ωμέγα	
    [omégha],	or	like	a	curved	top	hat	when	it’s	in	capitals	(Ω).	I	do,	or	I	make,	or	I’m	
    doing,	or	I’m	making	–	κάνω.		
	
S:	 Κάνω	[káno].		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	He	does,	He’s	doing,	She	does,	She’s	doing,	It	does,	It	is	doing,	
    It	is	making?		
	
S:	 Κάνει	[káni].		


                                                                                                17
	
T:	 Κάνει.	You	do?	
	
S:	 Κάνεις	[kánis].		
	
T:	 Κάνεις,	κάνεις.	How	would	you	say,	What	are	you	doing?	You	can	think	of	“why”	
    to	find	“what”.		
	
S:	 For	what,	τι	για,	τι,	τι	κάνεις;	[ti	kánis?].		
	
T:	 Τι	κάνεις;	Very	good.	So	this	could	mean,	What	are	you	doing?	And	it	also	means,	
    How	 are	 you?	 This	 is	 used	 in	 Greek	 like,	 How	 are	 you?	 Τι	 κάνεις;	 Actually,	 you	
    might	 have	 difficulties	 trying	 to	 make	 Greeks	 understand	 that	 you	 are	 asking,	
    What	 are	 you	 doing?	 and	 not,	 How	 are	 you?	 when	 you	 say,	 τι	 κάνεις;	 Mostly,	
    people	are	going	to	understand,	How	are	you?	They’re	going	to	reply	Kαλά	[kalá]	
    mostly,	“well”,	καλά.	But	you	might	mean,	you	know,	What	are	you	doing?	What	
    are	you	doing?	Τι	κάνεις;	And	they	will	repeat	you,	καλά.	Maybe	to	make	it	clear	
    you	 mean,	 What	 are	 you	 doing?	 …	 You	 might	 want	 to	 say	 something	 like,	 What	
    are	you	doing	now?	The	word	for	“now”	is	τώρα	[tóra],	τώρα:	T-O-R-A.		
	
S:	 Τώρα.		
	
T:	 Good.	So	how	would	that	be,	What	are	you	doing	now?		
	
S:	 Τι	τώρα	κάνεις;	[ti	tóra	kánis?].		
	
T:	 Don’t	 worry	 about,	 τώρα	 yet,	 because	 it	 will	 interfere	 beforehand,	 no?	 Worry	
    about	it	when	you	get	there.	The	first	bit	is,	What	are	you	doing?	
	
S:	 Τι	κάνεις;		
	
T:	 Τι	κάνεις;	And	now	the	word	for	“now”.		
	
S:	 Τώρα.		
	
T:	 Good.	 Τι	 κάνεις	 τώρα;	 [ti	 kánis	 tóra?].	 So	 here	 we	 would	 understand,	 What	 are	
    you	 up	 to	 now?	 rather	 than,	 How	 are	 you	 now?	 It	 makes	 it	 a	 little	 clearer.	 How	
    would	you	say,	What	is	he	doing?	or,	How	is	he?	
	
S:	 Τι	κάνει;	[ti	káni?].		
	
T:	 Τι	κάνει;	And	if	you	want	to	make	it	clear,	What	is	he	doing?	maybe	you	will	use	
    again	the	word	for	“now”,	What	is	he	doing	now?		
	
S:	 Τι	κάνει	τώρα;	[ti	káni	tóra?].		
	
T:	 Τι	κάνει	τώρα;	Again,	what	is	I	do,	or	I	make?		


                                                                                               18
	
S:	 Κάνω	[káno].		
	
T:	 Κάνω,	good.	So	we	have	κάνω	for	I	do	or	I	make.	And	we	mentioned	how	we’re	
    not	using	the	word	for	“I”,	but	of	course	we	do	have	a	word	for	“I”	in	Greek,	and	
    you	can	use	it	if	you	like,	maybe	to	be	emphatic,	for	example.	The	word	for	“I”	in	
    Greek	is,	εγώ	[eghó].	Εγώ.		
	
S:	 Εγώ.		
	
T:	 So	we	have	a	new	sound	here,	it’s	like	a	“soft	g”	[gh],	which	hangs	around	in	the	
    throat:	εγώ,	εγώ.		
	
S:	 Εγώ.		
	
T:	 Good,	perfect.	Does	it	look	like	a	word	in	English?	If	you	imagine	how	it	would	be	
    written,	maybe?		
	
S:	 Then	it’s	“ego”.		
	
T:	 Ego,	of	course.	When	in	English	we	say,	you	have	a	big	ego,	it	means	you	have	a	
    big	“I”,	no?	Εγώ.	So	you	can	use	this	to	be	emphatic.	Maybe	you	want	to	say,	I’m	
    staying,	you	know,	not	somebody	else.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Εγώ	μένω	[eghó	méno].		
	
T:	 Εγώ	μένω,	or	μένω	εγώ,	it’s	flexible.	I’m	waiting.		
	
S:	 Εγώ	περιμένω	[eghó	periméno].		
	
T:	 Εγώ	περιμένω,	περιμένω	εγώ.	I’m	insisting,	I’m	the	one	that’s	insisting.		
	
S:	 Εγώ	επιμένω	[eghó	epiméno].		
	
T:	 Bravo.	 I	 saw	 there	 you	 had	 an	 initial	 worry	 about	 remembering	 the	 word,	 and	
    then	you	said,	“Okay,	stay	in	control,	look	back	at	English”,	and	you	found	it.	Well	
    done.	Εγώ	επιμένω	–	I	am	insisting,	I’m	the	one	that’s	insisting.		
	
	 I‘m	not	insisting.		
	
S:	 Εγώ	δεν	επιμένω	[eghó	dhen	epiméno].		
	
T:	 Good,	 εγώ	 first.	 Εγώ	 δεν	 επιμένω.	 Because	 εγώ	 is	 like	 something	 extra	 that	 we	
    don’t	really	need;	it’s	like	something	you	hook	on	right	at	the	beginning	or	right	at	
    the	 end	 –	 Εγώ	 δεν	 επιμένω	 [eghó	 dhen	 epiméno],	 Δεν	 επιμένω	 εγώ	 [dhen	
    epiméno	eghó].		
	


                                                                                           19
	 “I	know”	in	Greek,	I	know,	is	ξέρω	[kséro].	Ξέρω.		
	
S:	 Ξέρω.		
	
T:	 You	can	think	of	this	as	K-S-E-R-O,	no?	Ξέρω.	Now	KS	in	Greek	is	one	letter.	The	
    letter	 looks	 like	 a	 capital	 E	 with	 a	 little	 tail	 (ξ),	 or	 in	 capitals	 it	 looks	 like	 three	
    horizontal	lines	(Ξ).	This	is	one	letter	giving	us	[ks],	the	letter	ξι	[ksi],	ξι.	You	don’t	
    need	to	worry	about	remembering	these	or	anything,	you	don’t	need	to	know	the	
    names	of	the	letters	of	course	to	speak	Greek,	but	I	will	mention	them	as	we	go	
    through	 the	 course,	 just	 in	 case	 you	 find	 yourself	 wanting	 to	 clarify	 what	 letter	
    something	is	written	with,	then	it’s	good	to	know	the	letter	names,	and	this	way	
    you	 will	 pick	 them	up	 as	 we’re	 discussing	them.	 So	this	 letter,	 ξι,	 is	 like	 the	 X	 in	
    English,	 only	 the	 [ks]	 sound	 doesn’t	 come	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 a	 word	 in	 English.	
    Ξέρω,	I	know.		
	
S:	 Ξέρω	[kséro].		
	
T:	 I	don’t	know.		
	
S:	 Δεν	ξέρω	[dhen	kséro].		
	
T:	 Δεν	ξέρω.	He	knows,	or,	She	knows.		
	
S:	 Ξέρει	[kséri].		
	
T:	 Ξέρει.	You	know.		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	[kséris].		
	
T:	 Ξέρεις.	Why	don’t	you	know?	Why	don’t	you	know?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	δεν	ξέρεις;	[yatí	dhen	kséris?].		
	
T:	 Γιατί	δεν	ξέρεις;	You	know	me.		
	
S:	 Με	ξέρεις	[me	kséris].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Με	ξέρεις	–	You	know	me.	You	don’t	know	me.		
	
S:	 Δεν	με	ξέρεις	[dhen	me	kséris].		
	
T:	 Δεν	με	ξέρεις,	good.	I	know.	Let’s	put	that	emphasis	for	“I”.	I	know.		
	
S:	 Ερώ;	[eró?].		
	
T:	 Εγώ,	 εγώ	 [eghó].	 It’s	 more	 like	 a	 gargling	 sound,	 but	 without	 the	 heavy	 friction.	
    Εγώ,	εγώ.		


                                                                                                          20
	
S:	 Εγώ.		
	
T:	 Perfect.

Teacher:		What	was	the	word	for,	Where?		
	
Student:		Πού	[pu].		
	
T:	 Πού,	 good.	 Don’t	 you	 know	 where	 he’s	 staying?	 So	 you	 need	 to	 break	 up	 this	
    sentence	in	an	intuitive	place.	Tell	me	in	English,	in	English,	not	in	Greek,	what	is

    then	we	find	the	verb,	then	we	have	to	think,	“Who	does	the	verb	refer	to?”,	no,

S:	 Γιατί	[yatí].		
	
T:	 Γιατί.	Doesn’t	he	know	why	you’re	staying?		
	


                                                                                         22
S:	 Doesn’t	he	know	...		
	
T:	 Exactly,	well	done,	that’s	the	first	bit.	Doesn’t	he	know	...		
	
S:	 Δεν	ξέρω	…	ξέρει.

S:	 Δεν	ξέρω	τι	περιμένεις	[dhen	kséro	ti	periménis].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	δεν	ξέρω	τι	περιμένεις.	Very	good.		
	
	 The	verb	for	“I	want”,	I	want,	is	θέλω	[thélo].	Θέλω.		
	
S:	 Θέλω.		
	
T:	 Θέλω.	 This	 is	 the	 TH	 sound	 of	 English	 “thank”,	 for	 example,	 θέλω.	 It’s	 quite	
    different	to	the	sound	of	“that”.	So	if	we	look	at	English,	we	have	two	separate	TH	
    sounds,	which	are	written	in	the	same	way:	then,	that,	this,	that’s	one	TH	sound	
    that	we	have	in	English,	and	this	sound	is	represented	by	the	letter,	δέλτα	[dhélta]	
    in	Greek,	that	letter	that	looks	like	a	“d”	(δ)	or	triangle	in	capitals	(Δ).	And	then	we	
    have	the	TH	sound	in	English	of	thank,	think.	This	much	stronger	[th]	sound	is	the	
    sound	that	we	have	in,	θέλω.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	[thélo].		
	
T:	 So	let’s	practise	both	of	these	sounds	together,	saying	I	don’t	want.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	[dhen	thélo].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλω.	You	have	δεν	with	that	δέλτα	(δ)	looking	like	a	“d”,	or	in	capitals	looks	
    like	a	triangle	(Δ),	and	the	letter	giving	us	the	[th]	sound	of	θέλω	looks	like	a	zero	
    or	an	O	with	a	horizontal	line	running	through	the	middle	(Θ,	θ).	This	is	the	letter	
    θήτα	[thíta],	θήτα.		How	would	you	say,	He	wants/she	wants/it	wants?		
	
S:	 Θέλει	[théli].		
	




                                                                                          23
T:	 Θέλει,	good.	Θέλει	is	also	used	in	some	circumstances	like	“need”;	you	might	say	
    θέλει	νερό	[théli	neró],	It	wants	water,	or	It	needs	watering,	referring	to	a	plant.	
    Or	 you	 might	 hear,	 θέλει	 αλάτι	 [théli	 aláti],	 It	 wants	 salt,	 It	 needs	 a	 bit	 of	 salt,	
    referring	 to	 some	 food.	 So	 you	 might	 hear	 θέλει	 used	 in	 that	 way	 as	 well,	 like	
    “need”.	How	would	you	say,	You	want?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις	[thélis].		
	
T:	 Θέλεις.	What	do	you	want?		
	
S:	 Τι	θέλεις;	[ti	thélis?].		
	
T:	 Τι	θέλεις,	Very	good.	I	know,	was	…	?		
	
S:	 Ξέρω	[kséro].		
	
T:	 Ξέρω.	If	you	want	to	say,	I	want	to	know,	there	is	not	“to	know”	in	Greek;	to	know	
    doesn’t	exist.	There	is	only,	I	know,	you	know,	he	knows,	etc.	So	to	say	“I	want	to	
    know”	in	Greek,	you	must	say	“I	want,	I	know”,	and	you	connect	these	two	verbs	
    with	 a	 sound	 that	 doesn’t	 mean	 anything.	 The	 sound	 is	 just	 connecting	 them,	
    making	it	very	clear	that	rather	than	two	separate	sentences,	“I	want”,	“I	know”,	
    you	 are	 saying	 “I	 want	 to	 know”.	 So	 the	 sound	 that	 connects	 these	 verbs	 is	 να	
    [na].	Να.		
	
S:	 Να.		
	
T:	 So	in	Greek,	to	say	“I	want	to	know”,	you	will	say	“I	want”	να	“I	know”,	and	that’s	
    how	you	will	get,	I	want	to	know.	So	how	would	that	sound?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	ξέρω	[thélo	na	kséro].		
	
T:	 Exactly.	Θέλω	να	ξέρω,	θέλω	να	ξέρω,	I	want	to	know.	I	don’t	want	to	know,	so	
    where	do	we	begin?		
	
S:	 I	don’t	want	to,	δεν	θέλω	…		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλω.		
	
S:	 Να	ξέρω.		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	ξέρω	[dhen	thélo	na	kséro].	I	don’t	want	to	know.	Good.	I	don’t	want,	
    να,	I	know.	“Να”	doesn’t	have	any	meaning	by	itself;	it’s	a	function	word.	It	just	
    has	 some	 functions	 but	 no	 meaning.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 You	 want	 to	 know,	 of	
    course	you	will	say,	You	want,	να,	you	know.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις	να	ξέρεις	[thélis	na	kséris].		
	


                                                                                                     24

S:	 Τι	θέλεις	να	ξέρεις;	[ti	thélis	na	kséris?].

S:	 Θέλει	να	ξέρει	[théli	na	kséri].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	θέλει	να	ξέρει.	He	wants	to	know	where	I’m	staying.		
	
S:	 Θέλει	να	ξέρει	πού	μένω	[théli	na	kséri	pu	méno].		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 θέλει	 να	 ξέρει	 πού	 μένω.	 Very	 good.	 She	 wants	 to	 know	 why	 you’re	
    not	waiting	for	me.	So	here	we	have	a	much	bigger	sentence,	but	all	it	is	…	it’s	just	
    those	small	little	structures	that	we	made	before,	just	more	of	them	together,	no?	
    So	we	shouldn’t	be	put	off	by	the	fact	we	have	a	long	sentence;	it’s	exactly	what	
    we’ve	been	doing	until	now,	just	a	little	bit	more	of	it.	So	the	first	bit	is,	She	wants,	
    She	wants	to	know,	but	let’s	start	with		She	wants.		
	
S:	 Θέλει.		
	
T:	 Θέλει.	She	wants	to	know	…		
	
S:	 Θέλει	να	ξέρει.		
	
T:	 Θέλει	να	ξέρει.	Why	...		
	
S:	 Γιατί.		
	
T:	 Γιατί	...	You’re	not	waiting	for	me.	All	of	that	part	we	need	to	treat	it	as	one	part,	
    because	 there’s	 just	 one	 verb	 there:	 You’re	 not	 waiting	 for	 me,	 and	 everything	
    else	is	revolving	around	that	verb,	no?	So,	You’re	not	waiting	for	me.

T:		Very	good.	She	wants	to	know	why	you’re	not	waiting	for	me.	Θέλει	να	ξέρει	γιατί	
    δεν	με	περιμένεις	[théli	na	kséri	yatí	dhen	me	periménis].	Well	done.	I	don’t	want	
    to	wait.	How	would	that	be?	I	don’t	want	to	wait.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	περιμένω	[dhen	thélo	na	periméno].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θέλω	να	περιμένω.	Don’t	you	want	to	wait	for	me?	So	again,	if	we	
    think	 of	 this	 sentence	 as	 just	 one	 unit,	 we	 might	 mix	 all	 of	 the	 different	 bits	 of	
    information	 that	 we	 have	 there	 together.	 Don’t	 you	 want	 to	 wait	 for	 me?	 Don’t	
    we	want	to	start	with,	Don’t	you	want.	We	don’t	worry	about	anything	else	other	
    than,	Don’t	you	want,	then	we	worry	about	the	next	bit.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλεις;		
	
T:	 Now	we	worry	about,	Τo	wait	for	me.		
	
S:	 Να	περιμένεις,	but	where	do	you	place	the	“me”?		
	
T:	 Where	does	that	“me”	go	generally?		
	
S:	 In	front	of	the	verb.		
	
T:	 Exactly,	before	the	verb.		
	
S:	 Να	με	περιμένεις.		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 very	 good.	 Δεν	 θέλεις	 να	 με	 περιμένεις;	 [dhen	 thélis	 na	 me

    wait	for	me?	Why	don’t	you	want	to	wait	for	me?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	δεν	θέλεις	με	περιμένεις	…	να	με	περιμένεις;		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Γιατί	δεν	θέλεις	να	με	περιμένεις;	[yatí	dhen	thélis	na	me	periménis?].

Teacher:		With	this	structure	that	we've	learnt	using	να	[na],	to	say	things	like,	I	want	
    to	know,	θέλω	να	ξέρω,	you	could	also	say	things	like,	I	want	you	to	know.	All	we	
    have	to	do	is	say:	I	want,	να,	you	know	–	a	very	small	change.	So	how	would	you	
    say	that,	I	want	you	to	know?		
	
Student:		Θέλω	να	ξέρεις	[thélo	na	kséris].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	να	ξέρεις,	I	want	you	to	know.	Do	you	want	me	to	wait?	So	it's	
    very	important	to	break	this	up,	no?	Do	you	want?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις	με	περιμένω;	[thélis	me	periméno?]	Or	is	it,	να	περιμένεις	[na	periménis]?		
	
T:	 The	structure	here	in	English	is	a	little	bit	complicated:	Do	you	want	me	to	wait?	
    So	 you	 might	 feel	 like	 we	 need	 to	 translate	 this	 “me”.	 But	 if	 we	 take	 the	 in-
    between	 steps	 to	 understand	 what's	 happening	 in	 Greek,	 so	 we	 think,	 okay,	 in	
    Greek,	 Do	 you	 want	 me	 to	 wait,	 is,	 Do	 you	 want,	 να,	 I	 wait,	 then	 we	 realise	
    actually	we	have	no	“me”	here	in	Greek.	So,	Do	you	want?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις.		
	
T:	 Θέλεις,	and	we	will	connect	it	with?		
	
S:	 Να.		
	
T:	 Να,	I	wait.		
	
S:	 Περιμένω.		
	
T:	 That's	it.	Θέλεις	να	περιμένω;	[thélis	na	periméno?].	Do	you	want	that	I	wait?	So	
    here	in	English	we	use	the	word	“me”,	but	in	Greek	–	much	more	literal:	Do	you	
    want,	 να,	 I	 wait.	 Θέλεις	 να	 περιμένω.	 And	 if	 you	 were	 to	 use	 the	 word	 for	 “I”,	
    what	would	that	word	be?		
	
S:	 Εγώ	[eghó].		
	
T:	 Εγώ.		
	
S:	 Εγώ	(Laughing).	It's	awful.		
	
T:	 No.	It's	good,	it's	good.	You	just	have	to	relax.		
	
S:	 Εγώ	[eghó].		
	
T:	 Good,	εγώ.	Not	με	[me],	not	me,	no?	Because	it's	I,	I	wait.	So	you	could	also	hear,	
    Θέλεις	να	περιμένω	εγώ;	[thélis	na	periméno	eghó?].	So	what	was	the	word	for	


                                                                                               27
   “me”	in	Greek?		
	
S:	 Με.		
	
T:	 Με.	Are	you	waiting	for	me?		
	
S:	 Με	περιμένεις;	[me	periménis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Με	περιμένεις;	The	word	for	“you”	is	σε	[se].	So	we	have	με	and	σε.	And	
    again,	 this	 is	 the	 informal	 you,	 the	 one	 we	 will	 use	 to	 speak	 with	 friends	 and	
    people	we	know.	I'm	waiting	for	you.		
	
S:	 Σε	περιμένω	[se	periméno].		
	
T:	 Bravo.	Σε	περιμένω,	σε	before	the	verb,	just	like	με.	Σε	περιμένω.	Do	you	want	me	
    to	wait	for	you?	Again,	we	could	have	a	confusion	with	this	“me”,	no?	If	we	just	
    scoot	over	thε	sentence	very	quickly	and	try	to	translate	it	as	a	package,	we	might	
    want	to	put	“me”	in	somewhere.	But	if	we	think,	how	is	the	structure	in	Greek?	
    Do	you	want	me	to	wait	for	you?	Let's	work	our	way	through	it.	Do	you	want?	
	
S:	 Θέλεις;	
	
T:	 Θέλεις.	And	then	what	comes?		
	
S:	 Να.		
	
T:	 Να.	Do	you	want,	να,	I	wait	for	you?		
	
S:	 Σε	περιμένω.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	No	με,	no	“me”.	Θέλεις	να	σε	περιμένω;	[thélis	na	se	periméno?].	Do	
    you	want,	να,	I	wait	for	you?	What	was	the	word	for,	Where,	again?		
	
S:	 Πού	[pu].		
	
T:	 Πού.	Where	do	you	want	me	to	wait	for	you?	So,	Where	do	you	want?

T:	 Very	good.	Πού	θέλεις	να	σε	περιμένω;	[pu	thélis	na	se	periméno?].	Very	good.		
	
	 So	there	is	an	in-between	step	when	structures	vary	slightly	from	how	we	would	
    say	it	in	English	–	Do	you	want	me	to	wait	for	you?	We	can	take	this	in-between	
    step	 to	 think,	 how	 is	 the	 structure	 in	 Greek?	 Do	 you	 want,	 να,	 I	 wait	 for	 you.	 I	
    don't	want	him	to	know	where	I'm	staying.	So	the	first	bit	–	I	don't	want	…		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω.		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλω.	I	don't	want	him	to	know.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	ξέρει.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θέλω	να	ξέρει,	I	don't	want	him	to	know	…	where	I'm	staying.		
	
S:	 Πού	μένω.		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 θέλω	 να	 ξέρει	 πού	 μένω	 [dhen	 thélo	 na	 kséri	 pu	 méno].	 I	 don't	
    want	him	to	know	where	I'm	staying.	Δεν	θέλω	να	ξέρει	πού	μένω.		
	
	 The	word	for	“here”	in	Greek,	here,	is	εδώ	[edhó].	Εδώ.		
	
S:	 Εδώ.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	What	sound	do	you	think	you	hear	there	in	the	middle?	The	consonant	
    sound,	which	one	is	it?	Εδώ.		
	
S:	 It's	the	same	as	“thank”	and	θέλω	[thélo].		
	
T:	 Is	it?	The	same	as	θέλω?	Is	it	εθώ	[ethó],	or	εδώ	[edhó]?		
	
S:	 So	it's	more	“then”.		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 It's	 like	 the	 δεν	 [dhen],	 of	 δεν	 θέλω,	 no?	 Δεν.	 So	 again	 this	 word	 is	
    written	with	δέλτα	[dhélta],	the	letter	that	looks	like	a	“d”	(δ)	or	like	a	triangle	in	
    capitals	(Δ).	Εδώ,	and	this	is	the	word	for	“here”.		
	
S:	 Εδώ.		
	
T:	 Εδώ	is	spelt	Ε	(or	έψιλον	[épsilon],	Ε/ε),	δέλτα	(Δ/δ),	and	then	the	[o]	sound	there	
    is	 with	 the	 W	 shape,	 ωμέγα	 [omégha,	 Ω/ω].	 So	 that's	 not	 just	 for	 the	 verb	
    endings;	 you	 will	 also	 find	 it	 in	 other	 places	 –	 εδώ.	 We	 said	 that	 the	 verb	 for	 “I	
    make”	 or	 “I	 do”	 is	 κάνω	 [káno].	 How	 would	 you	 say	 What	 are	 you	 doing	 here?	
    What	are	you	doing	here?		
	
S:	 Τι	κάνεις	...	here?	(Laughing)		
	


                                                                                                    29
T:	 So,	 we	 might	 have	 lost	 the	 word,	 concentrating	 on	 the	 other	 bit,	 but	 we	 had	 a	
    little	discussion	about	the	sound	in	that	word.	So	think	about	that	…	maybe	that	
    brings	the	word	back.		
	
S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	ah?	Τι	κάνεις	εδώ;	[ti	kánis	edhó?].	I'm	staying	here.		
	
S:	 Μένω	εδώ	[méno	edhó].		
	
T:	 Μένω	εδώ.	I	don't	want	to	wait	for	you	here.	So	we	begin	with	...	?		
	
S:	 I	don't	want.		
	
T:	 Bravo.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω.		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλω,	to	wait	for	you	here.		
	
S:	 So,	να	περιμένω	εδώ.		
	
T:	 Yes,	but	we	missed	the	“you”,	actually.		
	
S:	 Να	σε	περιμένω	εδώ.		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 θέλω	 να	 σε	 περιμένω	 εδώ	 [dhen	 thélo	 na	 se	 periméno	 edhó].	 I	
    want	you	to	wait	for	me	here.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	περιμένεις	εδώ.		
	
T:	 So	again	you	thought	of	the	verb	first,	no,	which	is	perfect.	But	then,	maybe	you	
    want	to	make	a	little	check	if	you	included	all	of	the	elements,	because	it's	very	
    natural	to	think	of	that	verb	first.	So	did	you	mention	all	of	the	elements?	I	want	
    you	to	wait	for	me	here.		
	
S:	 Ah,	με.		
	
T:	 Good.		
	
S:	 Να	με	περιμένεις	εδώ.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Give	it	to	me	all	together:	I	want	you	to	wait	for	me	here.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	με	περιμένεις	εδώ	[thélo	na	me	periménis	edhó].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλω	να	με	περιμένεις	εδώ.	I	want,	να,	you	wait	for	me	here.

Teacher:		So	we've	learnt	some	verbs.	What	was,	I	stay?		
	
Student:		Μένω	[méno].		
	
T:	 Μένω.	I	wait,	or	I'm	waiting?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	[periméno].		
	
T:	 I	insist?		
	
S:	 Επιμένω	[epiméno].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	I	know?		
	
S:	 Ξέρω	[kséro].		
	
T:	 Ξέρω.	I	want?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	[thélo	].		
	
T:	 Θέλω.	 So	these	 are	verbs,	and	 we	change	them	for	 different	people,	 as	well.	So	
    we	have	θέλω	–	I	want.	He	wants/she	wants?		
	
S:	 Θέλει	[théli].		
	
T:	 You	want?		
	
S:	 	Θέλεις	[thélis].		
	
T:	 Θέλεις.	At	school	they	usually	describe	verbs	as	“doing”	words,	but	that	can	get	
    quite	confusing.	If	you	think	“to	be”,	you’re	not	really	doing	anything,	but	that’s	a	
    verb	and	we	can	recognise	it	as	a	verb	by	its	form.	It’s	“to”:	“to	be”.	In	the	same	
    way	at	school	you	may	have	heard	that	nouns	are	things.	But	then	again,	when	we	
    get	to	words	like	“peace”,	“dream”,	you	might	be	confused	about	whether	that’s	a	
    thing	or	not.	So	to	identify	different	types	of	word,	you	want	to	look	at	the	form	of	
    the	 word.	 So	 we	 said	 that	 “to”	 words	 are	 verbs,	 “to	 stay”,	 “to	 wait”,	 and	 words	
    that	 we	 can	 put	 “the”	 or	 “a”	 in	 front	 of	 are	 nouns.	 For	 example,	 “the	 dream”,	
    that’s	 a	 noun.	 “The	 peace”,	 that’s	 a	 noun.	 Now,	 I’m	 not	 very	 concerned	 with	
    grammatical	terminology,	so	generally	during	this	course	we’re	not	really	going	to	
    use	a	lot	of	grammatical	terminology.	It’s	not	very	useful	for	us,	but	what	is	useful	
    for	us	is	to	be	clear	on	what	are	different	types	of	words	–	only	because	different	
    types	 of	 words	 behave	 differently.	 Verbs	 behave	 in	 one	 way,	 nouns	 behave	 in	 a	
    different	way.	We	will	see	this	throughout	the	course,	but	that’s	about	as	deep	as	
    we	 will	 get	 into	 grammatical	 terminology.	 We	 will	 talk	 about	 the	 language	 in	 a	



                                                                                               31
   more	logical	way.	So	let’s	learn	a	noun	in	Greek.	The	“mobile	phone”	in	Greek	is	
   το	(that’s	the	word	for	“the”),	το	κινητό	[to	kinitó].	Το	κινητό.		
	
S:	 Το	κινητό.		
	
T:	 Good.	Where	is	the	accent,	or	the	stress	on	the	word,	το	κινητό?		
	
S:	 At	the	end?		
	
T:	 At	the	end!	Very	good.	Το	κινητό.	This	is	actually	quite	literally	the	word	“mobile”,	
    because	κινητό	is	“kinetic”.	We	have	the	word	“kinetic”	in	English,	which	means	
    “movement”,	no?	We	have	kinetic	energy,	energy	that	comes	from	movement.	So	
    we	are	saying	the	same	thing	when	we	say	“mobile”,	something	that	moves.	Το	
    κινητό	–	something	kinetic.	How	would	you	say,	I	want	the	mobile	phone?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	το	κινητό	[thélo	to	kinitó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	το	κινητό.	Don’t	you	want	the	mobile?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλεις	το	κινητό;	[dhen	thélis	to	kinitó?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 θέλεις	 το	 κινητό;	 To	 get	 the	 word	 for	 “it”	 in	 Greek,	 we	 can	 just	
    take	 the	 word	 for	 “the”.	 So	 what	 is	 the	 word	 for	 “the”	 here	 in	 “the	 mobile”,	 το	
    κινητό?		
	
S:	 To	[to].		
	
T:	 To.	We	can	just	take	the	word	for	“the”	and	put	it	before	the	verb.	And	there	we	
    get	the	word	for	“it”.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	I	want	it,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Το	θέλω	[to	thélo].		
	
T:	 Το	θέλω.	Good.	I	want	the	mobile	phone:	Θέλω	το	κινητό.	I	want	it:	Το	θέλω.	We	
    just	take	the	word	for	“the”,	and	we	put	it	first,	like	με,	like	σε.	Το	θέλω.	I	don’t	
    want	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	θέλω	[dhen	to	thélo].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	θέλω.	Good,	δεν	first.	Δεν	το	θέλω.	Το,	με,	σε	wants	to	be	next	to	the	verb,	
    so	δεν	goes	first.	Δεν	το	θέλω.	I’m	doing	it,	I’m	doing	it,	I’m	making	it.		
	
S:	 Το	κάνω	[to	káno].		
	
T:	 Το	κάνω.	Very	good.	I	want	to	do	it/I	want	to	make	it.

T:	 So	 here,	 your	 brain	 is	 actually	 being	 a	 bit	 too	 powerful,	 no?	 You’re	 doing	 it	 all	
    together	and	you	put	that	“το”	at	the	beginning,	no?	Because	you	can	work	fast,	
    but	 you	 don’t	 need	 to	 work	 fast	 to	 be	 correct.	 You	 need	 to	 work	 slowly	 to	 be	
    correct,	no?	So,	actually	what	we	want	is,	I	want	to	do	it/to	make	it.	So	the	first	bit

S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
	
T:	 Εδώ.	 Where	 is	 the	 accent	 on	 these	 words?	 Where	 is	 the	 stress	 on	 these	 words,	
    εγώ,	εδώ?		
	
S:	 At	the	end.		
	
T:	 At	the	end.	Good.	Έχω	[ékho],	έχω	means	“I	have”.		
	
S:	 Έχω.		
	
T:	 Έχω.	So	we	have	the	stress	at	the	beginning,	and	we	also	have	a	new	sound	here,	
    another	new	sound	for	us	in	Greek.	This	sound	is	written	with	a	letter	that	looks	
    like	an	X	(χ)	in	Greek,	and	it	gives	us	this	[kh]	sound,	έχω	[ékho].		
	
S:	 Έχω.		
	
T:	 A	little	bit	of	friction	in	the	throat,	έχω.		
	
S:	 Έχω.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	have	the	mobile	phone/I	have	the	mobile/I	have	the	kinetic?		
	
S:	 Έχω	το	κινητό	[ékho	to	kinitó].		
	
T:	 Έχω	το	κινητό.	And	what	if	you	wanted	to	say,	I	have	it?		
	
S:	 Το	έχω	[to	ékho].		
	
T:	 Το	έχω.	Good.	I	don’t	have	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	έχω	[dhen	to	ékho].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	έχω.	Good.	When	this	X	in	Greek,	which	gives	us	[kh]	here	in	έχω,	when	it’s	
    followed	 by	 an	 [i]	 sound	 –	 when	 it’s	 followed	 by	 an	 [i]	 sound,	 it’s	 slightly	 softer	
    [ch].	Actually,	we	see	this	in	the	name	of	this	letter,	which	is	“χι”	[chi],	so	you	can	
    see	it’s	softer	there,	the	letter	χι.	So	how	would,	He	has/she	has/it	has	sound?		
	
S:	 Έχει	[échi].		


                                                                                                   34
	
T:	 Έχει.	Good.	It’s	more	like	a	“H”,	no?	Less	friction.	You	will	notice	this	in	the	Greek	
    word	for	“no”,	which	is,	όχι	[óchi].	Όχι.		
	
S:	 Όχι.		
	
T:	 Όχι.	So	we	have,	He	has/she	has/it	has	–	έχει.	And,	You	have?		
	
S:	 Έχεις	[échis].		
	
T:	 Έχεις.	Again,	softer	here	because	it’s	followed	by	an	[i]	sound.	How	would	you	say,	
    What	do	you	have?		
	
S:	 Τι	έχεις;	[ti	échis?].		
	
T:	 Τι	έχεις;	Very	good.	And	this	can	also	be	used	like,	What’s	wrong?	Τι	έχεις;	What’s	
    wrong/what’s	 up?	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 What	 does	 he	 have?	 or	 What’s	 up	 with	
    him?	It	could	mean	either:	What	does	he	have?	What	does	she	have?	What’s	up	
    with	him?	What’s	up	with	her?		
	
S:	 Τι	έχει;	[ti	echi?].		
	
T:	 Τι	έχει;	Very	good.	What	was	again	the	word	for	“mobile”,	the	mobile?		
	
S:	 Το	κινητό	[to	kinitó].		
	
T:	 Το	κινητό.	Good,	the	mobile.	“The	car”	in	Greek	is,	το	αυτοκίνητο	[to	aftokínito].	
    Το	αυτοκίνητο.		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο.		
	
T:	 Again,	 we	 have	 a	 very	 literal	 similarity	 to	 English.	 Because	 in	 English	 you	 have	
    “mobile”	and	then	you	have	“automobile”.	This	“auto”	is	αυτό	[aftó],	and	αυτό	is	
    actually	written	A-U-T-O.	When	you	see	the	Greek	letters	here,	it	looks	like	AUTO,	
    and	 “AU”	 in	Greek	 (αυ)	 gives	 you	[af]	or	 [av],	depending	 on	 the	 word.	 So	this	 is	
    literally	the	same	word:	auto-kinetic,	auto-mobile,	automobile	–	αυτοκίνητο.		
	
S:	 Αυτοκίνητο.		
	
T:	 Good.	Do	you	have	the	car?		
	
S:	 Έχεις	το	αυτοκίνητο;	[échis	to	aftokínito?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχεις	το	αυτοκίνητο;	Do	you	have	it?		
	
S:	 Το	έχεις;	[to	échis?].		
	


                                                                                              35
T:	 Το	έχεις;	Don’t	you	have	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	έχεις;	[dhen	to	échis?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	έχεις;	Very	good.		
	
	 “She	is/he	is/it	is”,	all	the	same	word	in	Greek,	is	είναι	[íne].	Είναι.		
	
S:	 Είναι.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	Where	is	it?/Where	is	he?/Where	is	she?		
	
S:	 Πού	είναι;	[pu	íne?].		
	
T:	 Πού	είναι;	Where	is	the	car?		
	
S:	 Πού	είναι	το	αυτοκίνητο;	[pu	íne	to	aftokínito?].		
	
T:	 Πού	είναι	το	αυτοκίνητο;	I	don’t	know	where	it	is.	I	don’t	know	…	where	…	it	is.		
	
S:	 Δεν	ξέρω	να	πού	είναι	…	το	είναι	…	[dhen	kséro	na	pu	íne	…	to	íne	…].		
	
T:	 So	let’s	wind	back	to	the	beginning	–	Ι	don’t	know,	that	first	bit.		
	
S:	 Δεν	ξέρω	[dhen	kséro].		
	
T:	 Δεν	ξέρω.	Where?		
	
S:	 Πού	[pu].		
	
T:	 Πού.	It	is/she	is/he	is.		
	
S:	 Είναι	[íne].		
	
T:	 Eίναι.	So	we	don’t	need	the	word	for	“it”	here,	no?	It’s	included	in	the	verb.	Δεν	
    ξέρω	 πού	 είναι	 [dhen	 kséro	 pu	 íne],	 I	 don’t	 know	 where	 it	 is.	 And	 “is”	 is	 a	 verb,	
    because	it	comes	from	“to	be”.	We	don’t	say	“he	be”,	but	“he	is”.	Δεν	ξέρω	πού	
    είναι.	 So	this	 could	mean,	 I	don’t	 know	where	it	 is/where	he	is/where	 she	is.	Do	
    you	know	where	the	car	is?	In	Greek,	the	order	will	be,	Do	you	know	where	is	the	
    car?	Do	you	know	where	the	car	is/Do	you	know	where	is	the	car?		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	πού	είναι	το	αυτοκίνητο;	[kséris	pu	íne	to	aftokínito?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ξέρεις	πού	είναι	το	αυτοκίνητο;	Το	αυτοκίνητο	is	coming	afterwards,	
    because	 it’s	 like	 extra	 information;	 we	 saw	 already	 that	 είναι	 includes	 “it	 is”.	 So	
    it’s,	Do	you	know	where	it	is?	And	then	we	clarify:	το	αυτοκίνητο.	Ξέρεις	πού	είναι	
    το	αυτοκίνητο;	Don’t	you	know	where	she	is?		


                                                                                                   36
	
S:	 Δεν	ξέρεις	να	πού	είναι	…	?	[dhen	kséris	na	pu	íne	…	?].		
	
T:	 Why	να?		
	
S:	 I	don’t	know,	just	because	I	think	that	you	have	to	connect	it?	
	
T:	 “I	want	to	know”,	for	example,	you	need	to	connect	them,	but	here	actually	πού	is	
    doing	the	job	of	connecting.	So,	Don’t	you	know	(δεν	ξέρεις),	where	she	is?		
	
S:	 Πού	είναι	[pu	íne].		
	
T:	 Good.	Δεν	ξέρεις	πού	είναι;	[dhen	kséris	pu	íne?].		
	
	 What	 you	 think	 it	 means	 if	 you	 hear,	 πρόβλημα	 [próvlima]?	 Πρόβλημα?	 What	
    does	that	sound	like?		
	
S:	 Like	“problem”.		
	
T:	 Very	good	The	[v]	sound	in	Greek,	most	of	the	time,	is	written	with	the	letter	that	
    looks	 like	 a	 B.	 The	 letter	 name	 is	 “βήτα”	 [víta],	 and	 this	 is	 the	 grey	 area	 we	 get	
    between	English	and	Greek	with	B’s	and	V	sounds.	We	have	“problem”,	and	then	
    πρόβλημα	 [próvlima]	 in	 Greek.	 We	 have	 the	 word	 “Bible”	 in	 English,	 which	
    actually	just	comes	from	the	Greek	word	for	book.	The	Bible	is	“the	book”.	“The	
    book”	 in	 Greek	 is,	 το	 βιβλίο	 [to	 vivlío].	 So	 whilst	 it	 sounds	 remarkably	 different,	
    when	you	see	that	written,	those	two	[v]	sounds	are	written	with	the	B	letter	in	
    Greek.	This	B	letter	is	called	βήτα	(Β/β).	So	this	βήτα	that	looks	like	a	B,	gives	us	a	
    V	 sound	 in	 Greek,	 and	 the	 word	 “alphabet”	 is	 actually	 alpha	 –	 άλφα	 [álfa],	 the	
    Greek	name	for	A	and	βήτα	–	very	possibly	from	the	Arabic	word	for	house,	as	the	
    hieroglyph	that	gave	rise	to	this	letter	was	actually	the	shape	of	a	floor	plan	for	a	
    house.	 So	 “the	 book”	 was,	 το	 βιβλίο,	 spelt	 with	 this	 letter	 βήτα	 and	 entering	
    English	as	“Bible”.	I	have	the	book,	how	would	that	be?	I	have	the	book.		
	
S:	 Έχω	το	βιβλίο	[ékho	to	vivlío].		
	
T:	 I	have	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έχει	[to	échi].		
	
T:	 I	have	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έχω	[to	ékho].	Το	έχω.		
	
T:	 Το	έχω.	Good.	So	if	you	think	of	the	sentence	too	quickly	or	too	rushed,	you	kind	
    of	mash	the	different	elements	together	and	you	came	up	with	έχει,	because	έχει	
    is	“it	has”.	But	it’s	not	“it	has”,	it’s	“I	have	it”.	So	as	long	as	we’re	sure	of	who	is	
    doing	 the	 verb,	 who	 the	 verb	 is	 changing	 for,	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 elements	 will	 fit	


                                                                                                    37
  around	 it.	 I	 have	 it	 –	 έχω,	 το	 έχω.	 So	 we	 saw	 that	 “problem”	 was	 πρόβλημα.	
  “System”	is	σύστημα	[sístima].	Σύστημα.		
	
S:	 Σύστημα.		
	
T:	 Many	words	that	end	in	M	or	MA	in	English,	have	actually	come	from	Greek,	like	
    “problem”	–	πρόβλημα,	“system”	–	σύστημα.	You	may	notice	that	the	accent	is	at	
    the	beginning	of	the	word:	πρόβλημα,	σύστημα.	Other	words	like	this	–	we	have	
    “program”,	which	in	Greek	is,	πρόγραμμα	[próghrama].	Again	we	have	the	[gh]	G	
    –	πρόγραμμα,	like	in	εγώ	[eghó].	How	do	you	think	you	would	say	“diagram”?		
	
S:	 Διάγραμμα	[dhiághrama].		
	
T:	 Διάγραμμα.	So	the	D	is	δέλτα,	and	then	the	G	is	like	in	εγώ.	Διάγραμμα,	diagram.	
    “Panorama”	is	πανόραμα;	“aroma”	–	άρωμα	[ároma];	“climate”,	slightly	different	
    –	κλίμα	[klíma].	
	
    	                            	




                                                                                        38

Teacher:		What	was	the	word	for,	I	have?		
	
Student:		Έχω	[ékho].		
	
T:	 Έχω,	good.	We	saw	that	adding	περι-	[peri],	meaning	“around”	or	“near”	to	μένω	
    [méno],	 we	 got	 “to	 wait”	 from	 “to	 stay”.	 If	 we	 add	 περι-	 to	 έχω	 (so	 “to	 around	
    have”)	we	get	the	verb	for	“contain”.	To	contain,	although	we	probably	won’t	use	
    it	in	the	“I”	form,	no,	–	I	contain.	We	will	probably	say,	It	contains.	So	how	would	
    that	sound?		
	
S:	 Περιέχει	[periéchi].		
	
T:	 Περιέχει.	What	does	it	contain?		
	
S:	 Τι	περιέχει;	[ti	periéchi?].		
	
T:	 Τι	περιέχει;	I	don’t	know	what	it	contains.		
	
S:	 Δεν	ξέρω	τι	περιέχει	[dhen	kséro	ti	periéchi].		
	
T:	 Δεν	ξέρω	τι	περιέχει.	Good.	I	don’t	want	to	know	what	it	contains.	I	don’t	want	to	
    know	what	it	contains.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	ξέρω	τι	περιέχει	[dhen	thélo	na	kséro	ti	periéchi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θέλω	να	ξέρω	τι	περιέχει,	very	good.	Do	you	remember	what	was	
    the	word	for	“problem”?		
	
S:	 Πρόβλημα	[próvlima].		
	
T:	 Πρόβλημα.	 Good.	 This	 “προ-“	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 “problem”,	 or	 πρόβλημα,	
    actually	means	“towards”.	It	can	be	προ-	or	προς-	in	different	words.	“Problem”	
    actually	 means	 “towards	 throwing”,	 towards	 or	 before.	 I’m	 not	 sure	 how	 that	
    word	came	to	be	coined.	But	that’s	where	the	word	has	its	root.	And	actually	you	
    can	see	it	in	English	–	I	don’t	know	if	you	know	in	English	the	word	“ballistic”,	used	
    in	military	terms,	like	a	ballistic	missile,	and	also	used	in	slang,	in	British	English	at	
    least.	You	can	say	“somebody	went	ballistic”	–	they	went	crazy.	So	ballistic	is	the	
    same	as	“blem”	(βλήμα),	it’s	throwing	–	πρόβλημα.	So	also	we	have	προς	[pros]	in	
    Greek,	meaning	towards.	Again,	what	was,	I	have?		
	
S:	 Έχω.		
	
T:	 Έχω.	 Προσέχω	 [prosékho],	 προσέχω	 means	 “look	 after”	 or	 “take	 care”,	 of	
    something	or	yourself	–	both	of	these	meanings	in	Greek.	So	how	would	you	say,	
    Ηe’s	taking	care?		


                                                                                               39
	
S:	 Προσέχει	[proséchi].		
	
T:	 Προσέχει.	You	are	taking	care/looking	after.		
	
S:	 Προσέχεις	[proséchis].		
	
T:	 Προσέχεις.	 I	 want	 you	 to	 look	 after	 yourself	 –	 we	 don’t	 need	 the	 word	 for	
    yourself.	If	we	just	say,	I	want	you	to	look	after,	it	will	be	understood	to	look	after	
    yourself,	not	something	else.	So,	I	want	you	to	look	after	yourself.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	προσέχεις	[thélo	na	prosékhis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	But	the	[kh]	here	a	little	softer	with	the	[i]	sound	afterwards.	Θέλω	να	
    προσέχεις	[thélo	na	proséchis].	I	want	you	to	look	after	the	car.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	προσέχεις	το	αυτοκίνητο	[thélo	na	proséchis	to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	να	προσέχεις	το	αυτοκίνητο.	Why	don’t	you	look	after	the	car?		
	
S:	 What	was	“why”	again?		
	
T:	 Try	to	think	of	how	it	was	built.	Don’t	worry	about	whether	you	have	memorised	
    the	words.	Think	about	how	you	might	be	able	to	find	it.		
	
S:	 So	is	“why”,	“what	for”,	γιατί	[yatí]?		
	
T:	 Bravo,	well	done.	Γιατί.	Why	don’t	you	look	after	the	car?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	δεν	προσέχεις	το	αυτοκίνητο;	[yatí	dhen	proséchis	to	aftokínito?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Γιατί	δεν	προσέχεις	το	αυτοκίνητο.	Why	don’t	you	look	after	it?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	δεν	το	προσέχεις;	[yatí	dhen	to	proséchis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Γιατί	 δεν	 το	 προσέχεις.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 Why	 don’t	 you	 look	 after	
    yourself?,	 you	 would	 just	 use	 the	 verb	 without	 anything.	 Why	 don’t	 you	 look	
    after?	 And	 it	 will	 be	 understood	 –	 Why	 don’t	 you	 look	 after	 yourself?	 So	 how	
    would	that	be?	
	
S:	 Γιατί	δεν	προσέχω	…	προσέχεις;		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Γιατί	δεν	προσέχεις;	[yatí	dhen	proséchis?].	Good.	The	verb	for	“I	try”	
    in	Greek	is	προσπαθώ	[prospathó].	Προσπαθώ.		
	
S:	 Προσπαθώ.		
	


                                                                                           40
T:	 Good.	What	is	the	[th]	TH	sound	we	have	in	προσπαθώ?	Is	it	like	δεν	[dhen]	or	is	it	
    like	θέλω	[thélo]?	Προσπαθώ.		
	
S:	 More	like	θέλω.		
	
T:	 Good.	So	it’s	the	one	that	looks	like	a	zero	or	an	O	with	a	horizontal	line	running	
    through	 the	 middle	 (Θ/θ).	 Προσπαθώ	 actually	 means	 something	 like	 “towards	
    passion”.	 Πάθος	 [páthos]	 is	 “passion”	 in	 Greek,	 so	 προσπαθώ,	 I	 try	 –	 “towards	
    passion”.		
	
S:	 Προσπαθώ	[prospathó].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθώ.	 Let’s	 make	 a	 little	 recap	 of	 the	 verbs	 we’ve	 learnt	 until	 now.	 What	
    was,	I	stay?		
	
S:	 Μένω	[méno].		
	
T:	 Μένω.	I	wait?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	[periméno].		
	
T:	 Περιμένω.	I	insist?		
	
S:	 Επιμένω	[epiméno].		
	
T:	 Επιμένω.	I	know?		
	
S:	 Ξέρω	[ksero].		
	
T:	 Ξέρω.	I	want?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	[thélo].		
	
T:	 Θέλω.	I	have?		
	
S:	 Έχω	[ékho].		
	
T:	 Έχω.	I	contain?	(Although	we	probably	wouldn’t	use	it	in	the	“I”	form.)		
	
S:	 Περιέχω	[periékho].		
	
T:	 Περιέχω,	very	good.	And,	I	look	after/I	take	care?		
	
S:	 Προσέχω	[prosékho].		
	
T:	 So	 we	 can	 see	 how	 the	 accent	 usually	 comes	 just	 before	 the	 ending	 that	 we	
    change	 –	 μένω,	 περιμένω,	 επιμένω,	 θέλεις,	 ξέρει.	 The	 accent	 is	 just	 before	 that	


                                                                                            41
   verb	ending	–	that	[o]	(ω),	that	[i]	(ει),	that	[is]	(εις).	But	with,	I	try,	we	have	the	
   accent	on	the	end	–	προσπαθώ	[prospathó].	So	there’s	a	group	of	verbs	in	Greek	
   that	 have	 their	 accents	 on	 the	 end,	 like	 this	 one.	 Προσπαθώ.	 But	 this	 shouldn’t	
   confuse	you.	How	would	you	say,	He’s	trying	or,	She’s	trying?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθέι	[prospathí].		
	
T:	 Good.	The	accent’s	still	on	the	end.	Προσπαθέι.	You’re	trying.		
	
S:	 Προσπαθείς	[prospathís].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθείς.	You’re	not	trying.		
	
S:	 Δεν	προσπαθέις	[dhen	prospathís].		
	
T:	 Δεν	προσπαθέις.	I’m	trying	to	do	it.		
	
S:	 Προσπαθώ	να	το	κάνω	[prospathó	na	to	káno].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθώ	να	το	κάνω.	I’m	trying	to	do	it.	Again,	You’re	trying?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθεί	...	προσπαθείς.		
	
T:	 Προσπαθείς.	Why	don’t	you	try	to	do	it?	Why	don’t	you	try	to	do	it?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	δεν	προσπαθέις	να	κάνει	...	κάνεις;	[yatí	dhen	prospathís	na	káni	…	kánis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Because	 you	thought	 of	“do	 it”,	and	 you	 thought	 “it	does”,	 no?	But	what	
    we	need	to	think	is	“you	do	it”.	So	κάνεις,	and	then	how	about	that	“it”?		
	
S:	 Το	κάνεις.		
	
T:	 Good.	Γιατί	δεν	προσπαθείς	να	το	κάνεις;	[yatí	dhen	prospathís	na	to	kánis?].	Very	
    good.	Why	don’t	you	try	to	do	it.		
	
    	                             	




                                                                                            42
Complete	Greek,	Track	10	–	Language	Transfer	
	
Teacher:	 	 As	 we	 mentioned	 on	 the	 first	 track,	 Complete	 Greek	 will	 be	 recorded	 on	
    the	 move	 throughout	 Europe,	 with	 various	 students.	 So	 we	 continue	 the	 course	
    with	our	second	student.	Hello.		
	
Student:		Hello.		
	
T:	 So,	 we	 were	 looking	 at	 the	 verb	 προσπαθώ	 [prospathó].	 Προσπαθώ,	 which	
    literally	means	something	like	“towards	passion”,	and	this	is	“I	try”,	προσπαθώ.		
	
S:	 Προσπαθώ	[prospathó].		
	
T:	 And	we	notice	that	the	accent	is	on	the	ending,	where	generally	with	the	verbs,	
    we	didn’t	have	the	accent	on	the	ending.	For	example,	I	want,	is?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	[thélo].		
	
T:	 Θέλω,	 good.	 So	 with,	 θέλω,	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 just	 before	 the	 ending.	 Θέλω	
    [thélo]	–	the	stress	is	there	just	before	the	ending.	I	wait?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	[periméno].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	περιμένω.	So	again	we	have	the	stress	just	before	that	[o]	(ω)	ending.	
    Περιμένω.	But	with	a	group	of	verbs	in	Greek,	we	will	find	the	accent	coming	on	
    the	end,	like	in	προσπαθώ.	How	would	you	say,	He’s	trying,	or	She’s	trying,	or	It’s	
    trying?		
	
S:	 Προσπάθει	[prospathí].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθεί,	good.	And,	You’re	trying.		
	
S:	 Προσπαθείς	[prospathís].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθείς,	very	good	Another	verb	that	has	the	accent	on	the	end	in	Greek,	is	
    the	verb	“I	can”.	I	can,	is	μπορώ	[boró].	Μπορώ.		
	
S:	 Μπορώ.		
	
T:	 Μπορώ.	So	the	first	sound	here	is	a	B,	and	we	saw	that	the	letter	in	Greek	that	
    looks	 like	 a	 B,	 the	 βήτα	 [víta]	 (Β/β),	 this	 gives	 us	 a	 V	 sound	 –	 like	 in	 πρόβλημα	
    [próvlima],	like	in	βιβλίο	[vivlío],	the	word	for	book.	So	that’s	spelt	with	this	letter	
    βήτα	 that	 looks	 like	 a	 B,	 but	 what	 we	 actually	 pronounce	 is	 a	 V.	 And	 we	
    mentioned	 that	 the	 word	 Bible	 in	 English	 just	 comes	 from	 the	 Greek	 word	 for	
    book,	βιβλίο.	So,	how	is	μπορώ	[boró]	spelt?	To	get	the	B	sound	in	Greek,	to	get	
    this	hard	B	sound,	you	actually	write	an	M	and	a	P	together.	An	M	shape	and	a	P	
    shape	together	in	Greek	(ΜΠ/μπ)	gives	us	this	hard	B,	μπορώ.		


                                                                                                   43
	
S:	 Μπορώ.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	can	wait	for	you?	I	can	wait	for	you.		
	
S:	 Μπορώ	να	σε	περιμένω	[boró	na	se	periméno].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Mπορώ	να	σε	περιμένω.	How	would	you	say,	I	can	do	it?		
	
S:	 Μπορώ	να	το	κάνω	[boró	na	to	káno].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μπορώ	 να	 το	 κάνω,	 very	 good.	 What	 was	 the	 word	 for,	 What?	 We	
    found	it	inside	of	the	word	for	“why”.	So	give	me	the	word	for,	Why,	first.	
	
S:	 Γιατί.		
	
T:	 Γιατί!	[yatí]	And	the	word	for,	What?		
	
S:	 Τι	[ti].		
	
T:	 Τι.	Very	good.	What	can	I	do?	Ηow	would	you	say	that?	What	can	I	do?	The	first	
    bit	is,	What	can	I,	so	let’s	start	there.		
	
S:	 Τι	μπορώ	[ti	boró].		
	
T:	 And	now	we	need	to	connect	the	verbs.		
	
S:	 Τι	μπορώ	να	κάνω;	[ti	boró	na	káno?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τι	μπορώ	να	κάνω;	What	was	the	word	for,	Now?		
	
S:	 Τώρα	[tóra].		
	
T:	 Τώρα.	Very	good.	I	can’t	do	it	now.	So	we	want	to	divide	this	up	and	start	with,	I	
    can’t.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	[dhen	boró].		
	
T:	 Δεν	μπορώ,	I	can’t	do	it	now.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	το	κάνω	τώρα	[dhen	boró	na	to	káno	tóra].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορώ	να	το	κάνω	τώρα.	And	just,	I	can’t,	by	itself?	How	is	that?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	[dhen	boró].		
	




                                                                                      44
T:	 Δεν	 μπορώ,	 good.	 The	 sound	 there	 of,	 δεν	 [dhen]	 –	 you	 can	 just	 think	 of	 the	
    English	word,	“then”.		
	
S:	 Δεν,	ah	okay.		
	
T:	 Δεν	 μπορώ.	 Δεν	 μπορώ,	 I	 can’t,	 you	 will	 hear	 this	 a	 lot	 in	 Greek,	 used	 as	 an	
    expression,	 like,	 “Oh,	 it’s	 too	 much!”	 –	 you	 know	 when	 something	 is	 too	 cute,	
    maybe	 somebody	 sees	 something	 that’s	 too	 cute,	 and	 they’ll	 say,	 Δεν	 μπορώ.	
    Maybe	 something	 is	 too	 bad	 and	 somebody	 will	 say,	 δεν	 μπορώ!	 Δεν	 μπορώ!	
    Something	is	too	loud:	δεν	μπορώ.	You	will	hear	this	very	often	in	Greek.	What	is,	
    He,	She,	or	It	can?		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	[borí].		
	
T:	 Μπορεί.	Good.	He	can	do	it.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	το	κάνει	[borí	no	to	káni].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	μπορεί	να	το	κάνει.	Μπορει	can	also	mean	“maybe”	like,	It	can,	it	can	
    be.	So,	μπορεί	να	το	κάνει,	other	than,	He	can	do	it/She	can	do	it,	might	also	mean	
    Maybe	 he’s	 doing	 it/Maybe	 she’s	 doing	 it.	 So	 you	 could	 say,	 Maybe	 you	 know	 –	
    you	would	say,	It	can,	να,	you	know.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	ξέρεις	[borí	na	kséris].		
	
T:	 Μπορεί	να	ξέρεις.	Maybe	you	know,	but	…	,	etc.	No	?	Μπορεί	να	ξέρεις.	What	was	
    the	word	for,	Here?		
	
S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
	
T:	 Εδώ,	good.	Maybe	she’s	waiting	for	me	here,	or,	She	can	wait	for	me	here.	It	could	
    mean	either,	no,	depending	on	the	context.	So	how	would	we	build	that?	Maybe	
    she’s	waiting	for	me	here,	or,	She	can	wait	for	me	here.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	με	περιμένει	εδώ	[borí	na	me	periméni	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	 Μπορεί	να	 με	περιμένει	εδώ.	 So,	μπορεί	 να	 με	περιμένει	εδώ	 could	
    mean,	 Maybe	 she’s	 waiting	 for	 me	 here/maybe	 he’s	 waiting	 for	 me	 here,	 or	 He	
    can	 wait	 for	 me	 here/she	 can	 wait	 for	 me	 here.	 And	 you	 will	 understand	 by	 the	
    context,	which	meaning	the	speaker	wants.	Can	you	do	it	now?		
	
S:	 Μπορείς	να	το	κάνεις	τώρα;	[borís	na	to	kánis	tóra?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μπορείς	να	το	κάνεις	τώρα;	Very	good.		
	
	 You	 can,	 using	 the	 word	 for	 “you”,	 emphasising	 you	 can,	 is	 εσύ	 μπορείς	 [esí	
    borís].	Εσύ	μπορείς.		


                                                                                             45
	
S:	 Εσύ	μπορείς.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	You	can’t,	again	using	the	word	for	“you”?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	δεν	μπορείς	[esí	dhen	borís].		
	
T:	 Εσύ	δεν	μπορείς.	I	can,	using	the	word	for	“I”?		
	
S:	 Εγώ	μπορώ	[eghó	boró].		
	
T:	 Εγώ	μπορώ.	So	we	have	εγώ	and	εσύ	for	”I”	and	“you”,	and	we	also	saw	that	we	
    have	 με	 and	 σε,	 for	 “me”	 and	 “you”,	 which	 means	 that	 we	 have	 two	 different	
    words	 for	 “you”	 in	 Greek:	 I	 and	 you	 (εγώ,	 εσύ);	 me,	 you	 (με	 and	 σε).	 So	 the	
    difference	between	these	two	words	for	“you”	in	Greek,	the	difference	between	
    εσύ	 and	 σε,	 is	 exactly	 the	 same	 as	 the	 difference	 between	 “I”	 and	 “me”,	 just	 in	
    English	that	word	doesn’t	change;	it’s	always	“you”.	“I	see	you,	you	see”	but	if	I’m	
    referring	to	myself	that	word	changes,	no?	“I	see,	you	see	me”.	“I”	becomes	“me”.	
    So	 we	 have	 a	 similar	 change	 like	 that	 in	 Greek	 for	 the	 word	 for	 “you”.	 So	 let’s	
    practise	that.	How	would	you	say,	You	know,	emphasising	“you”?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	ξέρεις	[esí	kséris].		
	
T:	 Εσύ	ξέρεις.	Good.	Εσύ	ξέρεις.	But,	if	I	say,	I	know	you,	we	won’t	use	εσύ,	we	will	
    use	…	?	
	
S:	 Σε	[se].		
	
T:	 Σε.	So	how	is	that?	I	know	you.		
	
S:	 Σε	ξέρω	[se	kséro].		
	
T:	 Σε	ξέρω.	Good.	Using	the	word	for	“you”,	to	be	emphatic,	You	know	me.	You	know	
    me.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	με	ξερείς	[esí	me	kséris].		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 εσύ	 με	 ξερείς.	 So	 here	 it’s	 εσύ,	 the	 verb	 is	 changing	 for	 “you”.	 Εσύ	
    ξερείς.	 Εγώ	 ξέρω.	 These	 two	 words,	 they	 look	 similar	 as	 well,	 εγώ,	 εσύ,	 in	 the	
    same	 way	 that	 με	 and	 σε	 look	 similar.	 So	 we	 understand	 they	 are	 from	 two	
    different	 groups	 of	 words.	 We	 can	 think	 of	 words	 like	 εγώ,	 εσύ	 [eghó,	 esí],	 as	
    belonging	 to	 one	 group,	 and	 words	 like	 με,	 σε,	 το	 [me,	 se,	 to],	 as	 belonging	 to	
    another	 group.	 The	 first	 set	 of	 words	 (εγώ,	 εσύ),	 are	 the	 ones	 that	 change	 the	
    verb.	 Εγώ	 θέλω,	 εσύ	 θέλείς	 [eghó	 thélo,	 esí	 thélis].	 Εγώ	 ξέρω,	 εσύ	 ξέρεις	 [eghó	
    kséro,	esí	kséris].	 And	the	second	set,	they	don’t:	we	could	say,	for	example,	με	
    ξέρει,	 σε	 ξέρει,	 το	 ξέρει	 [me	 kséri,	 se	 kséri,	 to	 kséri].	 Με,	 σε,	 το	 –	 they	 don’t	
    change	the	verb.	How	would	you	say,	I	know	you,	emphasising	the	word	for	“I”?		


                                                                                                  46
	
S:	 Εγώ	σε	ξέρεις	–	er	...	ξέρω.		
	
T:	 Εγώ	σε	ξέρω	[eghó	se	kséro].	Very	good.

Teacher:	The	verb	for	“I	see”	in	Greek	is,	βλέπω	[vlépo].	Βλέπω.		
	
Student:		Βλέπω.		
	
T:		Βλέπω.		
	
S:		Βλέπω.		
	
T:	 That’s,	I	see.	How	would	you	say,	I	see,	emphasising	“I”?		
	
S:	Εγώ	βλέπω	[eghó	vlépo].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	εγώ	βλέπω.	How	would	you	say,	I	see	you?		
	
S:	 Εγώ	σε	βλέπω	[eghó	se	vlépo].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Εγώ	σε	βλέπω.	And	of	course	σε	is	this	informal	you,	the	you	that	we	
    were	 using	 with	 friends,	 for	 example	 –	 εγώ	 σε	 βλέπω.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 you	
    see,	emphasising	the	word	for	“you”?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	βλέπεις	[esí	vlépis].		
	
T:	 Εσύ	βλέπεις.	Good.	You	see	me.		
	
S:	 Εσύ	με	βλέπεις	[esí	me	vlépis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Εσύ	με	βλέπεις.	The	word	for	“and”	in	Greek	is	και	[ke].	Και.		
	
S:	 Και.		
	
T:	 When	you	see	και	written,	it	will	look	like	a	K,	an	A,	and	an	I,	the	Greek	letters	that	
    look	like	K-A-I.	So	you	will	notice	that	A	and	I	together	in	Greek	(ΑΙ/αι)	make	[e].	
    KAI	(και)	[ke].	How	would	you	say,	I	see	it	and	I	want	to	have	it?	I	see	it	and	I	want	
    to	have	it.	So,	we	will	start	with,	I	see	it.		
	
S:	 Το	βλέπω	[to	vlépo].

T:	 I	think	that	second	part,	you’re	thinking	of	it	as	a	package,	rather	than	dividing	it	
    up,	no?	You’re	thinking	of,	I	want	to	have	it,	as	one	big	package.	And	it’s	always	
    best	to	divide	it	up	into	the	smallest	pieces	that	we	can.	So	the	first	bit	is,	I	want	…		
	
S:	 Το	θέλω	[to	thélo].		
	
T:	 Just,	I	want	…		
	
S:	 Θέλω	[thélo].		
	
T:	 Θέλω.	And	then	that	το	is	coming	later,	because	it’s,	I	want	to	have	it.	So	in	that	
    second	 part,	 you	 will	 deal	 with	 that	 το	 [to],	 and	 decide	 where	 to	 put	 it.	 So,	 το	
    βλέπω,	I	see	it,	και	θέλω	(and	I	want),	to	have	it.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	το	έχω	[thélo	na	to	ékho].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	το	έχω.	Good.	So	all	together,	I	see	it	and	I	want	to	have	it	–	not	from	
    memory,	but	thinking	it	through	again.		
	
S:	 Το	βλέπω	και	θέλω	να	το	έχω	[to	vlépo	ke	thélo	na	to	ékho].		
	
T:	 Bravo,	perfect.	Το	βλέπω	και	θέλω	να	το	έχω.	Very	good.	I	don’t	know	and	I	don’t

	 Και	εγώ	[ke	eghó],	And	I,	και	εγώ,	means	“me	too”.	Και	εγώ.		
	
S:	 Και	εγώ.		
	
T:	 For	example,	if	you	want	to	say,	I	also	see	it,	I	see	it	too,	you	will	say,	“I	see	it	and	
    I”,	or	“And	I,	I	see	it”.	So	this	is	what	you	will	say,	to	say,	I	also	see	it,	I	see	it	too.	
    So	firstly,	what	is,	I	see	it?		
	
S:	 Το	βλέπω	[to	vlépo].		
	
T:	 Το	βλέπω.	I	see	it,	and	I?		
	
S:	 Το	βλέπω	και	εγώ	[to	vlépo	ke	eghó].		
	
T:	 That’s	it.	Το	βλέπω	και	εγώ.	I	see	it	too.	So	that’s	how	you	will	make	that	structure	
    in	Greek,	using	the	word	for	“and”.	That,	και	εγώ,	can	also	come	at	the	beginning.		
	
S:	 Και	εγώ	το	βλέπω	[ke	eghó	to	vlépo].		
	
T:	 Και	εγώ	το	βλέπω.	So	it	doesn’t	change	the	essential	structure,	το	βλέπω,	it’s	just	
    an	add-on,	no?	An	add-on	to	show,	Me	too,	I	also	see	it.	How	would	you	say,	I	also

S:	 Και	εγώ	θέλω	[ke	eghó	thélo]	…	Και	εγώ	το	θέλω	[ke	eghó	to	thélo].		
	
T:	 Και	εγώ	το	θέλω.	Or?		
	
S:	 Το	θέλω	και	εγώ	[to	thélo	ke	eghó].

    to	kanó].	I	also	want	to	do	it.	Me	too,	I	want	to	do	it.	You	remember	how	was,	The	
    mobile	phone?		
	
S:	 Το	κινητό	[to	kinitó].		
	
T:	 Το	κινητό.	And,	The	auto-mobile,	the	automobile,	the	car?		
	


                                                                                             50
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο	[to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 I	also	want	the	car?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	το	αυτοκίνητο	και	εγώ	[thélo	to	aftokínito	ke	eghó].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 το	 αυτοκίνητο	 και	 εγώ.	 Και	 εγώ	 θέλω	 το	 αυτοκίνητο.	 So	 θέλω	 το	
    αυτοκίνητο	και	εγώ,	it	means,	Me	also	(me	as	well	as	other	people)	want	the	car.	
    But	you	could	also	say,	I	also	want	the	car,	but	meaning,	I	want	the	car	(as	well	as	
    other	things).	I	want	the	car	and	the	bicycle,	for	example.	Now	in	English,	when	
    you	 say,	 “I	 want	 the	 car,	 too”,	 it’s	 a	 little	 bit	 ambiguous.	 It	 could	 mean,	 “I	 also	
    want	 the	 car”,	 or	 “I	 want	 the	 car	 also,	 as	 well	 as	 other	 things”.	 It’s	 a	 little	
    ambiguous	in	English.	In	English,	we	understand	by	the	context	what’s	going	on.	
    But	in	Greek,	if	you	want	to	show	that	difference	(I	want	the	car	also,	as	well	as	
    other	things),	you	would	just	say,	“I	want	and	the	car”.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	και	το	αυτοκίνητο	[thélo	ke	to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	και	το	αυτοκίνητο,	no?	So	this	is	not,	Me	too,	I	also	want	the	car;	
    this	is,	I	want	the	car	as	well	as	the	other	thing	I	mentioned.	How	would	you	say,	I	
    also	have	the	mobile	phone?	So,	Me	too,	me	as	well,	I	have	the	mobile	phone.		
	
S:	 ‘Έχω	το	κινητό	και	εγώ	[ékho	to	kinitó	ke	eghó].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	if	you	wanted	to	say,	I	also	have	the	mobile,	as	well	as	other	things?	I	
    also	have	the	mobile.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Έχω	και	το	κινητό	[ékho	ke	to	kinitó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	και	το	κινητό.	So,	I	have	this	one	thing	that	you	asked	me	about	
    already,	and	also	I	have	the	phone	–	Έχω	και	το	κινητό.	I	have	the	car	as	well	as	
    other	 things,	 as	 well	 as	 something	 else	 that	 we	 mentioned,	 no?	 I	 have	 the	 car,	
    also.		
	
S:	 Έχω	και	το	αυτοκίνητο	[ékho	ke	to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Έχω	 και	 το	 αυτοκίνητο.	 The	 accent	 on	 αυτοκίνητο	 is	 on	 [kin]	
    (αυτοκίνητο),	whereas	the	accent	on	κινητό	is	on	the	end.	Έχω	και	το	αυτοκίνητο.

Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	the	mobile?		
	
Student:	Το	κινητό	[to	kinitó].		
	
T:	 Το	κινητό.	And	the	automobile,	the	car?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο	[to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	το	αυτοκίνητο.	The	accent	moves,	no?	We	have	το	κινητό,	and	then	το	
    αυτοκίνητο.	 I	 mentioned	 that	 this	 αυτό	 [aftó]	 that	 we	 put	 at	 the	 beginning,	 is	
    “auto”;	it’s	actually	spelt	with	the	Greek	letters	that	look	like	A-U-T-O.	And	the	AU	
    in	Greek,	together	(αυ),	gives	us	[af]	or	[av],	αυτό.		
	
	 So	 αυτό,	 other	 than	 “auto”,	 also	 means	 “this”,	 and	 the	 meanings	 are	 kind	 of	
    related,	 no?	 “Auto”	 is	 like	 “self”,	 no?	 Αυτοκίνητο	 [aftokínito]	 is	 self-moving,	
    automobile,	 no?	 And	 “this”	 and	 “self”	 are	 kind	 of	 related	 in	 their	 meaning.	 So,	
    αυτό	also	means	“this”.	How	would	you	say,	I	want	this?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	αυτό	[thélo	aftó].		
	
T:	 Good,	θέλω	αυτό.	Αnd	we	have	αυτό	after	the	verb.	It’s	only	those	small	words	
    like	με	[me],	σε	[se],	το	[to]	–	we’ve	seen	those	three	so	far	–	that	come	before	
    the	verb.	So,	I	want	it,	is?		
	
S:	 Το	θέλω	[to	thélo].		
	
T:	 Το	θέλω,	but,	I	want	this?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	αυτό	[thélo	aftó].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	αυτό,	very	good.	I	don’t	want	this.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	αυτό	[dhen	thélo	aftó].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλω	αυτό.	I	don’t	want	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	θέλω	[dhen	to	thélo].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 το	 θέλω,	 very	 good.	 This	 mobile	 phone,	 is,	 αυτό	 το	 κινητό	 [aftó	 to	 kinitó],	
    αυτό	το	κινητό.	So	to	say,	this	mobile,	in	Greek,	we	say	“this	the	mobile”,	“self	the	
    phone”,	“the	phone	itself”	–	this	phone.	So	again	we	see	the	related	meanings	of	
    αυτό,	as	“auto”	or	“self”	and	“this”,	no?	So	it’s	something	like	“the	phone	itself”:	
    this	or	self	the	phone	–	αυτό	το	κινητό.	Don’t	you	want	this	mobile	phone?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλεις	αυτό	το	κινητό;	[dhen	thélis	aftó	to	kinitó?].		


                                                                                              52
	
T:	 And	what	was,	I	have?		
	
S:	 Έχω	[ékho].		
	
T:	 Έχω.	You	have?		
	
S:	 ‘Εχεις	[échis].		
	
T:	 Εχεις.	Don’t	you	have	this	mobile	phone?		
	
S:	 Δεν	έχεις	αυτό	το	κινητό;	[dhen	échis	aftó	to	kinitó?].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Δεν	 έχεις	 αυτό	 το	 κινητό;	 What	 was	 the	 word	 for,	 problem	 –	 do	 you	
    remember?		
	
S:	 Πρόβλημα	[próvlima].		
	
T:	 Πρόβλημα,	πρόβλημα.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	This	problem?		
	
S:	 Αυτό	το	πρόβλημα	[aftó	to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτό	το	πρόβλημα.	I	don’t	have	this	problem.		
	
S:	 Δεν	έχω	αυτό	το	πρόβλημα	[dhen	ékho	aftó	to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	έχω	αυτό	το	πρόβλημα.	So,	αυτό	means	“this”.	But	in	Greek,	there	
    are	three	genders	for	nouns.	Nouns	are	generally	words	we	can	put	“the”	in	front	
    of,	we’ve	mentioned	–	the	problem,	the	phone.	The	nouns	that	we’ve	seen	so	far	
    are	neuter	nouns.	In	Greek,	we	have	masculine,	feminine,	and	neuter.	English	also	
    has	three	genders;	just	they	don’t	appear	as	often	as	they	do	in	Greek.	In	English,	
    we	 have	 “he”,	 which	 is	 masculine,	 “she”,	 which	 is	 feminine,	 and	 “it”,	 which	 is	
    neuter	 –	 it’s	 not	 masculine	 or	 feminine,	 it’s	 like	 no	 gender.	 So	 that	 gives	 us	 our	
    three	genders,	masculine,	feminine,	and	neuter.		
	
	 You	 might	 say,	 well,	 you	 can	 say	 that	 about	 any	 language,	 but	 you	 can’t.	 For	
    example,	 in	 Turkish,	 “he”,	 “she”,	 and	 “it”	 is	 all	 the	 same	 word.	 Turkish,	 for	
    example,	 doesn’t	 make	 that	 differentiation	 between	 feminine,	 masculine,	 and	
    neuter.	 It	 doesn’t	 exist.	 So	 English	 already	 makes	 this	 difference,	 between	
    masculine,	feminine,	and	neuter,	and	Greek	does	as	well,	but	Greek	does	it	with	
    all	nouns.	The	nouns	that	we’ve	learnt	so	far	have	been	neuter	nouns.	What	was,	
    the	problem?		
	
S:	 Το	πρόβλημα	[to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόβλημα.	The	aroma?		
	


                                                                                                  53
S:	 Το	άρωμα	[to	ároma].		
	
T:	 Το	 άρωμα,	 good,	 the	 accent	 at	 the	 beginning,	 το	 άρωμα.	 So	 these	 are	 neuter	
    nouns,	and	neuter	nouns	take	“το”,	for	“the”.	The	car?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο	[to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο.	And	neuter	nouns	also	take,	αυτό	for	“this”.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	
    this	car?		
	
S:	 Αυτό	το	κινητό	[aftó	to	kinitó].		
	
T:	 That	means,	this	mobile	phone.		
	
S:	 Αυτό	το	αυτοκίνητο	[aftó	to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Yes.	 Αυτό	 το	 αυτοκίνητο.	 Very	 good.	 The	 masculine	 word	 for	 “this”	 is,	 αυτός	
    [aftós].	Aυτός.		
	
S:	 Aυτός.		
	
T:	 Aυτός.	And,	αυτός	also	means	“he”,	this	masculine	thing,	this	masculine	person	–	
    he,	αυτός.	And	this	S	(ς)	that	we	find	on	αυτός,	is	a	common	masculine	ending	in	
    Greek.	So,	we	can	say,	He	wants	it,	using	the	word	for	“he”,	and	how	would	that	
    be?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	το	θέλει	[aftós	to	théli].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτός	το	θέλει.	That	S	(ς)	ending,	that	is	masculine,	not	for	the	verb,	
    for	the	noun.	So	that’s	why	it’s	very	nice	for	us	to	understand	what	…	what	are	the	
    different	 types	 of	 words,	 because	 this	 affects	 how	 they	 behave.	 We	 mentioned	
    that	with	nouns	we	have	this	S	as	a	masculine	ending,	but	if	we	put	an	S	(ς)	on	the	
    verb,	who	will	it	refer	to?		
	
S:	 To	“you”.		
	
T:	 Exactly,	no?	So	here	we’re	talking	about	nouns.	Αυτός	–	this	S	makes	it	masculine.	
    Αυτός	το	θέλει,	and	we	stay	with	θέλει.	He	is	waiting	for	me?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	με	περιμένει	[aftós	me	periméni].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτός	με	περιμένει.	How	would	you	say,	He,	too,	he’s	also	waiting	for	
    me?	He’s	also	waiting	for	me.		
	
S:	 Και	αυτός	με	περιμένει	[ke	aftós	me	periméni].		
	




                                                                                        54
T:	 Very	 good.	 Και	 αυτός	 με	 περιμένει.	 Με	 περιμένει	 και	 αυτός	 [me	 periméni	 ke	
    aftós].	Very	good.		
	
	 So	 we	 have	 αυτό	 [aftó]	 for	 “this”	 with	 neuter	 nouns,	 and	 αυτός	 [aftós]	 for	
    masculine	 nouns,	 and	 this	 S	 (ς)	 is	 a	 common	 masculine	 ending	 we	 will	 see	 for	
    nouns	throughout	Greek.		
	




                                                                                           55
Complete	Greek,	Track	13	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	So	what	was	the	word	for,	This,	for	neuter	nouns?		
	
Student:	Αυτό	[aftó].		
	
T:	 Αυτό,	good.	And	what	do	we	do	to	make	that	masculine?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	[aftós].		
	
T:	 Αυτός.	 So	 this	 is	 the	 word	 for	 “this”	 for	 masculine	 nouns,	 and	 also	 the	 word	 for	
    “he”	–	αυτός.	So	most	nouns	ending	in	s/ς,	in	Greek,	are	masculine,	although	not	
    all	of	them.	And	of	course	it’s	important	to	know	the	difference	between	types	of	
    words.	When	we	talk	about	how	a	word	behaves,	it	depends	on	the	type	of	word	
    we’re	 talking	 about.	 So	 we	 saw	 already	 how	 verbs	 behave,	 words	 like	 μένω	
    [méno],	no?	If	you	want	to	say,	He	stays,	we	say?		
	
S:	 Μένει	[méni].		
	
T:	 Μένει.	And,	You	stay?		
	
S:	 Μένεις	[ménis].		
	
T:	 Μένεις.	So	here	we	are	discussing	verbs.	But	then,	when	we	look	at	nouns,	we	will	
    have	 a	 different	 set	 of	 guidelines	 of	 how	 they	 behave	 and	 how	 to	 manipulate	
    them.	So,	s/ς	with	a	verb,	it’s	referring	to	you,	but	s/ς	with	a	noun	is	showing	us	
    that	 the	 noun	 is	 masculine,	 most	 of	 the	 time.	 For	 example,	 the	 word	 δρόμος	
    [dhrómos]	 means	 “road”,	 and	 this	 is	 a	 masculine	 noun,	 δρόμος.	 We	 have	 it	 in	
    English:	aerodrome,	hippodrome	–	hippodrome	actually	means	“horse	road”;	it’s	
    an	 ancient	 word	 for	 horse,	 hippo.	 Actually,	 hippopotamus,	 it’s	 Greek,	 it	 means	
    “river	 horse”.	 Ποταμός	 [potamós]	 is	 the	 word	 for	 river	 in	 Greek.	 So	 the	
    hippopotamus	 is	 a	 river	 horse.	 You’ll	 begin	 to	 get	 the	 feeling	 of	 which	 words	 in	
    English	 originate	 from	 Greek,	 and	 you’ll	 be	 able	 to	 pick	 them	 apart	 –	 either	 to	
    internalise	 words	 you’ve	 already	 come	 across,	 or	 to	 find	 new	 words	 and	 their	
    meanings,	like	in	hippopotamus.	The	first	bit	is	not	very	useful,	because	that’s	an	
    ancient	 word,	 but	 the	 second	 bit,	 ποταμός,	 is	 useful	 –	 that’s	 the	 word	 for	 river.	
    Masculine	nouns	use	“ο”	[o]	for	“the”.	So,	The	road,	is?		
	
S:	 Ο	ντρόμος	[o	drómos].		
	
T:	 Ο	δρόμος	[o	dhrómos].		
	
S:	 Ο	δρόμος	[o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 And	the	letter	here	is	the	δέλτα	[dhélta],	like	in	“then”,	no?	Ο	δρόμος.		
	
S:	 Ο	δρόμος.		


                                                                                                56
	
T:	 Ο	δρόμος,	ο	δρόμος.	How	would	you	say,	the	river?		
	
S:	 Ο	ποταμός	[o	potamós].		
	
T:	 Ο	ποταμός,	very	good.	This	road?	So	we	will	say,	This	the	road.		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	δρόμος	[aftós	o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	ο	δρόμος,	very	good.	So,	the	s/ς	is	for	masculine	nouns,	not	for	plural.	So	
    we	have	to	be	careful	as	well	not	to	assume	a	plural	where	we	don’t	have	one.	For	
    example,	ο	καφές	[o	kafés],	ο	καφές,	is	“the	coffee”,	but	we	might	see	that	and	
    read	“the	coffees”.	But	it’s	not	a	plural.	What	is	this	s/ς	showing	us	here?		
	
S:	 That	it’s	masculine.		
	
T:	 It’s	masculine,	exactly	–	ο	καφές.	So	there	are	some	exceptions,	there	are	many	
    words	that	end	in	s/ς	that	are	not	masculine.	But	generally,	the	s/ς	will	show	you	
    that	the	word	is	masculine.	To	be	sure,	you	will	see	the	word	for	“the”	or	the	word	
    for	“this”	–	ο	καφές.	This	coffee?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	καφές	[aftós	o	kafés].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	ο	καφές.	And	then	you	are	sure	this	is	a	masculine	noun.		
	
S:	 That’s	why	all	the	guys	are	called	Κώστας	[Kóstas],	Χρίστος	[Khrístos],	…		
	
T:	 Exactly,	 exactly.	 Or	 my	 name,	 Μιχάλης	 [Mikhális].	 This	 s/ς	 on	 Μιχάλης	 is	 a	
    masculine	ending.	Well	done.	Speaking	of	names,	ο	άντρας	[o	ándras]	means	“the	
    man”,	the	man.		
	
S:	 Ο	άντρας.		
	
T:	 Αντρέας	 [Andréas]	 in	 Greek,	 and	 Andrew	 in	 English,	 just	 comes	 from	 the	 word,	
    άντρας.	 These	 names	 mean	 “manly”.	 Αντρέας/Andrew,	 it	 means	 like	 “the	 manly	
    one”.	 Or	 even	 Alexander:	 -ander	 in	 Alexander	 is	 άντρας.	 Alexander	 means	
    something	 like	 “the	 defender	 of	 men”;	 it’s	 a	 battle	 term.	So	 we	 have,	 ο	 άντρας,	
    the	man.	How	would	you	say,	this	man?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	άντρας	[aftós	o	ándras].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	ο	άντρας,	good.	What	was	the	word	for,	here?		
	
S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
	
T:	 Εδώ.	You	remember	the	word	for,	he	is/she	is/it	is?		
	


                                                                                             57
S:	 Είναι	[íne].		
	
T:	 Είναι.	How	would	you	say,	The	man	is	here?		
	
S:	 Ο	άντρας	είναι	εδώ	[o	ándras	íne	edhó].		
	
T:	 Ο	άντρας	είναι	εδώ.	What	was	the	word	for,	why?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	[yatí].		
	
T:	 Γιατί.	Γιατί	–	you	can	also	use	like	“because”.	Before,	I	gave	the	similarity	to	Latin	
    languages,	 like	 porque	 that	 you	 have	 in	 Spanish,	 or	 something	 similar	 in	 French	
    and	Portuguese.	These	words	can	also	be	used	like	“why”	or	“because”,	because	
    the	literal	meaning	is	either	“for	what”	or	“because	of	what”	–	γιατί.	And	it	works	
    for	 “because”	 and	 for	 “why”.	 So	 you	 could	 say,	 This	 man	 is	 here	 because	 he’s	
    waiting	for	me.	So	let’s	begin	with,	This	man	is	here.		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	άντρας	είναι	εδώ	[aftós	o	ándras	íne	edhó].		
	
T:	 Because?		
	
S:	 Γιατί.		
	
T:	 He	is	waiting	for	me.		
	
S:	 Με	περιμένει	[me	periméni].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτός	ο	άντρας	είναι	εδώ	γιατί	με	περιμένει	[aftós	o	ándras	íne	edhó	
    yatí	me	periméni].	How	would	you	say,	He	is	here	because	he’s	waiting	for	me?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	είναι	εδώ	γιατί	με	περιμένει	[aftós	íne	edhó	yatí	me	periméni].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτός	είναι	εδώ	γιατί	με	περιμένει.	How	would	you	say,	He	sees?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	βλέπει	[aftós	vlépi].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	βλέπει,	good.	He	sees	you?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	σε	βλέπει	[aftós	se	vlépi].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	σε	βλέπει,	good.	He	also	sees	you?		
	
S:	 Και	αυτός	σε	βλέπει	[ke	aftós	se	vlépi].

S:	 Δεν	σε	βλέπει;	[dhen	se	vlépi?].		
	
T:	 And	if	we	want	to	use	the	word	for	“he”,	we	can	just	stick	it	at	the	beginning	or	
    stick	it	on	the	end.	So	let’s	do	that	using	the	word	for	“he”,	as	well.	Doesn’t	he	see	
    you?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	δεν	σε	βλέπει;	[aftós	dhen	se	vlépi?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Αυτός	 δεν	 σε	 βλέπει;	 Δεν	 σε	 βλέπει	 αυτός;	 [dhen	 se	 vlépei	 aftós?].

S:	 Και	αυτός	δεν	σε	περιμένει;	[ke	aftós	dhen	se	periméni?].		
	
T:	 Και	 αυτός	 δεν	 σε	 περιμένει;	 Δεν	 σε	 περιμένει	 και	 αυτός	 [dhen	 se	 periménei	 ke	
    aftós]?	I	would	say	it’s	slightly	more	natural	to	have	it	on	the	end,	and	if	you	have	
    it	at	the	beginning,	it’s	more	emphatic.	Δεν	σε	περιμένει	και	αυτός;	Or,	if	we	really	
    want	to	emphasise	that:	Και	αυτός	δεν	σε	περιμένει;	
	
	 The	 word	 “apology”	 in	 English	 comes	 from	 Greek	 –	 απολογία	 [apoloyía].	 This	
    actually	 means	 “from	 speech,	 from	 reason,	 from	 thought”,	 something	 like	 this.	
    Από	[apó]	means	“from”,	and	λογία	[loyía],	as	we	have	in	psychology,	biology,	is	
    something	 like	 reasoning,	 thought,	 speech,	 dialogue.	 Psychology,	 for	 example,	 is	
    the	dialogue	of	the	soul.	Ψυχή	[psichí]	is	“soul”	in	Greek.	This	is	why	you	have	the	
    “ps”	in	English	for	psychology	–	ψυχή.	Discourse	of	the	soul,	so	we	think	about	it	
    as	something	of	the	mind,	no,	but	here	in	Greek	we	are	using	the	word	soul,	even	
    though	 both	 words	 actually	 might	 refer	 to	 the	 same	 thing.	 So	 από,	 like	 in	
    απολογία,	apology,	means	“from”.	How	would	you	say,	He	is	from	here?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	είναι	από	εδώ	[aftós	íne	apó	edhó].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	είναι	από	εδώ.	Very	good.	He	is	not	from	here?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	δεν	είναι	από	εδώ	[aftós	dhen	íne	apó	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτός	δεν	είναι	από	εδώ.	How	would	you	say,	He	is	also	from	here?		
	
S:	 Και	αυτός	είναι	από	εδώ	[ke	aftós	íne	apó	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Και	αυτός	είναι	από	εδώ.	If	you	want	to	ask,	“Where	is	he	from?”,	in	
    Greek,	you	will	ask	“From	where	is	he?”	So	you	will	start	with	the	word	“from”.	
    From	where	is	he?	
	
S:	 Από	πού	είναι;	[apó	pu	íne?].		


                                                                                           59
	
T:	 Από	 πού	 είναι;	 And	 of	 course,	 without	 the	 word	 αυτός	 [aftós],	 this	 could	 mean,	
    Where	is	he	from/where	is	she	from/where	is	it	from?	Από	πού	είναι;	But	if	you	
    wanted	to	clarify	that	you	meant	“he”,	what	would	you	do?		
	
S:	 Από	πού	είναι	αυτός;	[apó	pu	íne	aftós?].		
	
T:	 Από	 πού	 είναι	 αυτός;	 And	 this	 αυτός	 is	 flexible.	 You	 could	 also	 say:	 Αυτός,	 από	
    που	είναι;	[aftós	apó	pu	íne?].	Just	that	it’s	slightly	more	emphatic	–	Αυτός,	από	
    πού	είναι;	The	most	natural	order,	as	you	gave	me:	Από	πού	είναι	αυτός;

Teacher:	Give	me	again	the	word	for,	this,	for	neuter	nouns.		
	
Student:	Αυτό	[aftó].		
	
T:	 And	for	masculine?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	[aftós].		
	
T:	 Good.	And,	the	problem?		
	
S:	 Το	πρόβλημα	[to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόβλημα.	This	problem?		
	
S:	 Αυτό	το	πρόβλημα	[aftó	to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Αυτό	το	πρόβλημα.	The	man?	You	can	think	of	Andreas,	Andrew.		
	
S:	 Ο	άντρας	[o	ándras].		
	
T:	 Ο	άντρας.	And,	this	man?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	άνδρας	[aftós	o	ándras].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	ο	άνδρας.	The	feminine	word	for	“this”?	So	the	word	for	“this”,	referring	to	
    feminine	nouns	is,	αυτή	[aftí].	Αυτή.		
	
S:	 Αυτή.		
	
T:	 And	this,	as	you	may	have	guessed,	is	also	the	word	for	“she”	–	αυτή.	This	[i]	(η)	
    ending	 is	 a	 common	 feminine	 ending.	 So	 again	 we	 are	 talking	 about	 nouns,	 not	
    verbs.	We	already	saw	in	the	verbs,	we	have	the	ending	[i]	(ει)	–	for	he,	she	and	it.	
    Verbs	cannot	be	feminine	or	masculine	in	Greek,	only	nouns.	So	this	is	why,	whilst	
    we	avoid	grammatical	terminology,	we	really	want	to	be	clear	on	groups	of	words,	
    what	 are	 different	 groups	 of	 words,	 because	 they	 behave	 differently.	 The	 [i]	
    sound	 for	 the	 verbs,	 we	 actually	 mentioned	 that	 it’s	 like	 E	 (ε)	 and	 I	 (ι)	 together	
    (περιμένει,	 μένει).	 This	 EI	 together	 (ει)	 gives	 us	 the	 [i]	 sound	 for	 verbs.	 The	
    feminine	[i]	sound,	as	in	αυτή,	is	spelt	with	a	letter	that	looks	like	an	“n”	(η).	When	
    you	finish	up	that	“n”,	you	carry	on	that	vertical	line	down,	hanging	below	the	line	
    of	 writing.	 And	 then	 capitals,	 this	 letter	 actually	 looks	 like	 a	 capital	 H.	 So	 with	
    some	Greek	letters	you	will	notice	a	stark	contrast	between	the	small	letter	and	
    the	 capital	 letter,	 and	 this	 [i]	 sound,	 which	 we	 find	 very	 often	 ending	 feminine	
    words,	is	a	good	example	of	this.	The	small	[i]	is	like	a	small	“n”	(η),	and	then	the	
    capital	looks	like	a	capital	H.	So	αυτή	in	capitals	looks	like	“AYTH”.	But	this	is	not	
    [th]	(θ).	TH	in	capitals	in	Greek	is	not	[th],	it’s	[ti]	(τη),	because	“th”	in	Greek	we	


                                                                                                  61
   know	 as	 in,	 θέλω	 [thélo],	 we	 write	 with	 that	 circle,	 with	 the	 horizontal	 line	
   running	through	it	(Θ/θ).	So,	if	you	are	in	Greece,	for	example,	looking	around	the	
   city	and	looking	at	words	that	you	find	around,	which	is	often	in	capitals,	don’t	get	
   confused	when	you	see	TH,	thinking	 that’s	a	[th].	No,	that	H	is	a	[i]	sound.	How	
   would	you	say,	She	knows	me,	using	the	word	for	“she”?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	με	ξέρει	[aftí	me	kséri].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτή	με	ξέρει.	So	the	[i]	of	αυτή	[aftí]	is	written	with	that	“n”,	or	that	H	
    in	capitals,	and	then	the	[i]	of	ξέρει	[kséri],	as	it’s	a	verb,	its	written	EI	(ει),	no?	But	
    it’s	the	same	sound.	Αυτή	με	ξέρει.	What	was,	I	can?	It	started	with	a	[b].		
	
S:	 Μπορώ	[boró].		
	
T:	 Μπορώ.	She	can.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	[borí].		
	
T:	 And	using	the	word	for	“she”?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	μπορεί	[aftí	borí].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	μπορεί.	She	can	do	it.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	μπορεί	να	το	κάνει	[aftí	borí	na	to	káni].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτή	μπορεί	να	το	κάνει.	What	was,	I	try,	or,	“towards	passion”?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθεί	[prospathí].		
	
T:	 I	try.		
	
S:	 Ah,	προσπαθώ	[prospathó].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθώ.	Good.	She	is	trying?		
	
S:	 Προσπάθεi	[prospáthí].		
	
T:	 Better	with	the	accent	on	the	ending	with	this	verb,	no?	Προσπαθεί	[prospathí].	
    She	is	trying	to	do	it.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	προσπαθεί	να	το	κάνει	[aftí	prospathí	na	to	káni].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτή	προσπαθεί	να	το	κάνει.	Προσπαθεί	να	το	κάνει	αυτή	[prospathí	na	to	
    káni	aftí].	She	is	here.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	εδώ	[aftí	íne	edhó].		


                                                                                             62
	
T:	 Αυτή	είναι	εδώ.	She	is	also	here.		
	
S:	 Και	αυτή	είναι	εδώ	[ke	aftí	íne	edhó].		
	
T:	 Και	αυτή	είναι	εδώ.	She	is	also	from	here.	What	was	the	word	for,	from?	We	can	
    look	at	“apology”.		
	
S:	 Από	[apó].		
	
T:	 Από,	good.	She	is	also	from	here.		
	
S:	 Και	αυτή	είναι	από	εδώ	[ke	aftí	íne	apó	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Και	αυτή	είναι	από	εδώ.	Very	good.	So	we	might	find	ourselves	using	
    words	like,	αυτός,	αυτή,	more	than	words	like,	εγώ,	εσύ,	just	because	the	form	of	
    the	 verb	 can	 refer	 to	 he,	 she,	 or	 it.	 They	 all	 share	 the	 same	 verb	 form,	 so	 you	
    might	 find	 yourself	 using	 these	 words	 a	 little	 more	 often	 to	 clarify.	 But	 usually,	
    from	the	context,	you	know	who	you’re	talking	about.	So	let’s	practise,	I	want	him	
    to	wait,	and	we	will	use	the	word	for	“him”	or	“he”	in	Greek:	I	want,	να,	he	waits	–	
    he.	And	that	“he”	on	the	end	is	clarifying	who	we	mean.	So,	I	want	him	to	wait.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	περιμένει	αυτός	[thélo	na	periméni	aftós].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 να	 περιμένει	 αυτός.	 And	 usually,	 once	 you’ve	 mentioned	 who	 you	
    are	 talking	 about,	 you	 don’t	 need	 to	 mention	 it	 again,	 unless	 you	 are	 having	 a	
    conversation	where	you	are	switching	between	“she”	and	“he”,	and	you	will	have	
    to	 use	 them,	 no?	 So	 these	 words	 in	 Greek,	 you	 only	 use	 them	 for	 clarity	 or	 for	
    emphasis.	 Θέλω	 να	 περιμένει.	 Θέλω	 να	 περιμένει	 αυτός.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 be	
    emphatic,	or	if	you	want	to	clear	up	any	doubt.	I	want	her	to	do	it.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	το	κάνει	αυτή	[thélo	na	to	káni	aftí].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	 να	 το	 κάνει	 αυτή,	 θέλω	 να	 το	 κάνει	 αυτή.	 Good.	 Απολογία	 (apology),	 is	 a	
    feminine	noun.	Feminine	nouns	take	[i]	(“η”)	for	“the”.	So	how	would	you	say,	The	
    apology?		
	
S:	 Η	απολογία	[i	apoloyía].		
	
T:	 Η	απολογία.	How	do	you	think	this	[i]	is	written,	if	you	have	to	guess?		
	
S:	 Η?		
	
T:	 Exactly.	 With	 the	 H	 in	 capitals,	 or	 the	 letter	 that	 looks	 like	 an	 “n”	 (η)	 in	 small	
    letters.	So	this	is	what	we	associate	with	the	feminine	[i],	this	particular	letter	(η).	
    Η	απολογία	[i	apoloyía].	And	if	you	wanted	to	say,	This	apology?		
	


                                                                                                   63
S:	 Αυτή	η	απολογία	[aftí	i	apoloyía].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτή	η	απολογία.	Good.	Η	πόλη	[i	póli],	η	πόλη,	is	“the	city”.	Η	πόλη.		
	
S:	 Η	πόλη.		
	
T:	 We	 have	 this	 word	 in	 English,	 no?	 We	 have	 “cosmopolitan”,	 for	 example.	
    “Cosmos”	 in	 Greek	 (κόσμος	 [kózmos])	 is	 “world”.	 “Cosmopolitan”	 means	 like	 a	
    worldly	city.	Κόσμος,	what	gender	does	it	look	like?		
	
S:	 Masculine.		
	
T:	 Masculine.	It	is.	So	how	would	you	say,	the	world?		
	
S:	 Ο	κόσμος	[o	kózmos].		
	
T:	 Ο	κόσμος,	very	good.	This	world?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	κόσμος	[aftós	o	kózmos].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	ο	κόσμος,	very	good.	Again	tell	me	how	was,	the	city?		
	
S:	 Η	πόλη	[i	póli].		
	
T:	 Η	πόλη.	This	city?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	η	πόλη	[aftí	i	póli].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	η	πόλη,	good.	So	we’ve	seen	that	nouns	in	Greek	can	be	neuter,	they	can	be	
    masculine,	 or	 they	 can	 be	 feminine.	 And	 we	 will	 explore	 this	 throughout	 the	
    course	 and	 see	 how	 we	 can	 identify	 which	 are	 which.	 But	 generally,	 when	 you	
    look	 up	 a	 word,	 you	 want	 to	 learn	 it	 with	 the	 word	 for	 “the”,	 so	 if	 you	 were	 to	
    look	up	the	word	for	“city”	in	the	dictionary,	you	would	see	πόλη,	and	then	you	
    would	also	see	next	to	it	a	little	symbol	to	show,	or	an	abbreviation	to	show,	that	
    it’s	feminine	–	which	means	that	instead	of	telling	yourself	πόλη,	you	should	tell	
    yourself,	η	πόλη.	That	makes	a	very	big	difference,	because	when	you	want	to	use	
    the	word,	you	probably	won’t	be	wondering	“oh,	what	gender	is	it?”.	You	would	
    have	learnt	it	as,	η	πόλη.	This	is	important,	because	adjectives,	describing	words,	
    so	 these	 are	 words	 we	 can	 usually	 put	 “is”	 in	 front	 of.	 “It	 is	 big/yellow/tall”.	
    Describing	 words	 change	 to	 match	 nouns.	 For	 example,	 the	 word	 for	 “big”	 is	
    μεγάλος	[meghálos].	Μεγάλος.		
	
S:	 Μεγάλος.		
	
T:	 Of	course	this	is	where	we	get	words	like	“mega”	from,	in	English.	Μεγάλος	would	
    be	used	to	refer	to	something	masculine.	So,	for	example,	if	you	were	to	say,	The	
    world	is	big,	how	would	you	say	it?		


                                                                                                  64
	
S:	 Ο	κόσμος	είναι	μεγάλος	[o	kózmos	íne	meghálos].		
	
T:	 Good.	Ο	κόσμος	είναι	μεγάλος.	If	you	want	to	say,	The	car	is	big,	μεγάλος	is	going	
    to	change	to	look	neuter,	to	match,	the	car.	So	let’s	try	that.	The	car	is	big.		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο	είναι	μεγάλο	[to	aftokínito	íne	meghálo].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 You	 lose	 the	 S	 to	 make	 it	 look	 neuter.	 Το	 αυτοκίνητο	 είναι	 μεγάλο.	
    How	do	you	think	you	would	make	μεγάλο	feminine?		
	
S:	 Μεγάλη	[megháli].		
	
T:	 Μεγάλη,	of	course.	How	would	you	say,	The	city	is	big?		
	
S:	 Η	πόλη	είναι	μεγάλη	[i	póli	íne	megháli].		
	
T:	 Η	πόλη	είναι	μεγάλη.	Very	good.	This	city	is	big.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	η	πόλη	είναι	μεγάλη	[aftí	i	póli	íne	megháli].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτή	η	πόλη	είναι	μεγάλη.	So	when	we	come	across	new	nouns,	we	
    want	to	try	to	learn	them	with	the	word	for	“the”.	So,	if	you	look	the	noun	up	in	
    the	 dictionary,	 try	 to	 find	 the	 symbol	 or	 the	 abbreviation	 that	 shows	 you	 the	
    gender,	or	if	you	ask	somebody	for	the	word,	ask	them	for	the	word	for	“the”.	So	
    instead	 of	 saying	 “How	 do	 you	 say	 bed?”,	 ask	 “How	 do	 you	 say	 the	 bed?”.	 This	
    way,	when	you	have	to	manipulate	that	noun,	when	you	have	to	match	adjectives	
    to	that	noun,	you	are	not	then	in	that	moment	wondering,	for	the	first	time,	“Oh,	
    what	is	the	gender	of	this	word?”,	and	having	to	guess	it.	Does	that	make	sense?	
    Because	you	look	very	thoughtful.		
	
S:	 No,	I’m	just	thinking	that	I	should	have	done	that	with	German.		
	
T:	 Ah.	Okay,	good.		
	




                                                                                            65

Teacher:	What	was,	I	can?		
	
Student:	Μπορώ	[boró].		
	
T:	 Μπορώ.	I	can	do	it?		
	
S:	 Μπορώ	να	το	κάνω	[boró	na	to	káno].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μπορώ	 να	 το	 κάνω.	 So	we	 saw	 “να”	 as	 connecting	 these	 two	 verbs.	
    And	 we	 also	 mentioned	 that	 it’s	 not	 “to”.	 The	 translation	 of	 να	 is	 not	 “to”.	 Να	
    doesn’t	have	a	translation.	Να	is	a	function	word.	It	has	a	function,	no?	Μπορώ	να	
    το	κάνω.	Actually	in	this	very	sentence	in	English,	we	also	don’t	have	“to”.	I	can	do	
    it,	rather	than,	I	can	to	do	it.	So	να	is	not	“to”.	Να	is	a	word	with	some	functions.		
	
	 You	 can	 also	 start	 the	 sentence	 with	 να,	 to	 give	 the	 meaning	 or	 the	 function	 of	
    “shall”.	For	example,	if	you	say	with	a	question	tone	to	your	voice,	Να	περιμένω,	
    this	in	Greek	is	understood	as,	“Shall	I	wait?”.	Να	περιμένω;	So	you	can	start	the	
    sentence	with	να,	and	here	να	has	a	different	function.	It’s	giving	us	the	feeling	of	
    “shall”	or	“should”.	Να	περιμένω;	“Shall	I	wait?”.	“Should	I	wait?”.	How	would	you	
    say,	Should	I	wait	for	you?		
	
S:	 Να	σε	περιμένω;	[na	se	periméno?].		
	
T:	 Να	 σε	 περιμένω;	 And	 we	 must	 include	 this	 intonation	 tone	 as	 well.	 Να	 σε	
    περιμένω;		
	
S:	 Να	σε	περιμένω;

S:	 Πού	να	σε	περιμένω;	[pu	na	se	periméno?].		
	
T:	 Πού	να	σε	περιμένω;	You	could	also	say,	Shall	I	wait	for	you	here?	How	would	that	
    be?		
	
S:	 Να	σε	περιμένω	εδώ;	[na	se	periméno	edhó?].		
	
T:	 Να	σε	περιμένω	εδώ;	Very	good.	So	περιμένω	is,	I	wait.	We	wait,	is	περιμένουμε	
    [periménume].	Περιμένουμε.		
	
S:	 Περιμένουμε.		
	
T:	 So	we	have	[ume]	(-ουμε)	for	“we”.	Περιμένουμε.		
	
S:	 Περιμένουμε.		


                                                                                               66
	
T:	 Shall	we	wait?		
	
S:	 Να	περιμένουμε;	[na	periménume?].		
	
T:	 Να	περιμένουμε;	Good.	What	was,	I	do,	or	I	make?		
	
S:	 Κάνω	[káno].		
	
T:	 Κάνω.	We	do.	We	make?		
	
S:	 Κάνουμε	[kánume].		
	
T:	 Κάνουμε.	What	shall	we	do?		
	
S:	 Να	τι	κάνουμε?		
	
T:	 So	where	do	we	start	in	English?	What.		
	
S:	 Τι.	Τι	να	κάνουμε;	[ti	na	kánume?].		
	
T:	 Τι	να	κάνουμε.	No?	So	maybe	you	are	going	to	head	out	with	some	friends,	and	
    you	say,	Τι	να	κάνουμε;	What	should	we	do?	What	shall	we	do?	What	should	I	do?		
	
S:	 Τι	να	κάνω;	[ti	na	káno?].		
	
T:	 Τι	να	κάνω;	Where	should	we	do	it?	Where	shall	we	do	it?		
	
S:	 Πού	το	κάνουμε;	[pu	to	kánume?].	
	
T:	 Πού	 το	 κάνουμε	 means,	 Where	 are	 we	 doing	 it?	 But	 if	 you	 want	 to	 get	 that	
    meaning	of	should	or	shall	…		
	
S:	 Πού	να	το	κάνουμε;	[pu	na	to	kánume?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πού	να	το	κάνουμε;	Where	shall/where	should	we	wait	for	you?		
	
S:	 Πού	να	σε	περιμένουμε;	[pu	na	se	periménume?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	να	σε	περιμένουμε.	Good.	Σε	[se],	other	than	“you”,	also	means	
    “to”	 or	 “in”	 or	 even	 “on”.	 So	 these	 words	 are	 not	 related,	 they	 just	 sound	 the	
    same	 –	 σε	 in	 Greek.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 in	 the	 car,	 σε	 το	 αυτοκίνητο	 [se	 to	
    aftokínito]	 contracts	 to,	 στο	 αυτοκίνητο	 [sto	 aftokínito].	 So,	 σε	 το,	 contracts	 to	
    στο.	 You	 can	 imagine	 many	 years	 of	 σε	 το,	 σε	 το	 …	 στο,	 στο	 –	 it	 just	 stuck	
    together.	So	στο	means	“in	the”.	How	would	you	say,	We	are	waiting	in	the	car?		
	
S:	 Περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο	[periménume	sto	aftokínito].		


                                                                                              67
	
T:	 Περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο.	We	are	waiting	for	you	in	the	car.		
	
S:	 Σε	περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο	[se	periménume	sto	aftokínito].	
	
T:	 Σε	περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο.	Should	we	wait	for	you	in	the	car?		
	
S:	 Να	σε	περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο	[na	se	periménume	sto	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Να	 σε	 περιμένουμε	 στο	 αυτοκίνητο;	 [na	 se	 periménume	 sto	 aftokínito?].	 So	 it	
    must	 make	 a	 question	 intonation:	 Να	 σε	 περιμένουμε	 στο	 αυτοκίνητο;	 And	 this	
    way	 we	 will	 understand,	 Shall	 we?	 You	 could	 also	 change	 the	 intonation	 to	 give	
    the	feeling	of	“let’s”.	So	imagine	if	you	want	to	say,	Let’s	wait	in	the	car,	you	can	
    again	 use	 “να”	 and	 just	 change	 the	 tone	 of	 voice.	 How	 would	 that	 sound?	 Let’s	
    wait	in	the	car.		
	
S:	 Να	περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο	[na	periménume	sto	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Να	 περιμένουμε	 στο	 αυτοκίνητο.	 So	 a	 very	 affirmative	 tone	 of	 voice.	 Να	
    περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο.	There	the	meaning	changes:	Let’s	wait	in	the	car,	as	
    opposed	to,	Να	περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο;	(Shall	we	wait	in	the	car?)	So	you	
    can	 achieve	 all	 of	 that	 in	 Greek	 just	 with	 your	 tone	 of	 voice,	 and	 this	 να	 at	 the	
    beginning,	that	is	alerting	us	to	the	fact	that	something	extra	is	going	on.	It’s	not	a	
    simple,	Περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο	(we	are	waiting/we	wait	in	the	car).	This	να	
    shows	us	that	something	else	is	going	on	and	we	will	tune	into	the	tone	of	voice	to	
    understand	what	exactly	that	is.	Να	περιμένουμε	στο	αυτοκίνητο;	(Shall	we	wait	
    in	 the	 car?)	 Να	 περιμένουμε	 στο	 αυτοκίνητο.	 (Let’s	 wait	 in	 the	 car.)	 How	 would	
    you	say,	Shall	we	wait	in	this	car?	Shall	we	wait	in	this	car?		
	
S:	 Να	περιμένουμε	σε	αυτό	το	αυτοκίνητο;	[na	periménume	se	aftó	to	aftokínito?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Να	 περιμένουμε	 σε	 αυτό	 το	 αυτοκίνητο;	 Very	 good.	 Tell	 me	 again	
    what	was,	it	is/he	is/she	is?		
	
S:	 Είναι	[íne].		
	
T:	 Είναι.	How	would	you	say,	It	is	in	the	car?		
	
S:	 Το	είναι	[to	íne]	...	?		
	
T:	 	“It	is”	is	all	included	in,	είναι.	You	don’t	need	the	word	for	“it”.	Είναι	all	by	itself	is	
    just,	it	is/he	is/she	is.	So,	It	is	in	the	car.		
	
S:	 Είναι	στο	αυτοκίνητο	[íne	στο	αυτοκίνητο].	
	
T:	 Very	good.	Είναι	στο	αυτοκίνητο.	“I	am”	in	Greek	is,	είμαι	[íme].	Είμαι.		
	


                                                                                                   68
S:	 Είμαι.		
	
T:	 So	 very	 similar	 to	 “It	 is”,	 but	 instead	 of	 that	 N	 (ν),	 we	 have	 an	 M	 (μ).	 Actually	
    sounds	like	“I’m”	in	English.	Είμαι.		
	
S:	 Είμαι.		
	
T:	 I’m	here.		
	
S:	 Είμαι	εδώ	[íme	edhó].		
	
T:	 Είμαι	εδώ.	I	am	also	here.		
	
S:	 Είμαι	και	εδώ	[íme	ke	edhó].		
	
T:	 That	 means,	 I’m	 also	 here	 (as	 well	 as	 somewhere	 else),	 which	 is	 a	 bit	 difficult	
    physically.		
	
S:	 Και	εγώ	είμαι	εδώ	[ke	eghó	íme	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Kαι	εγώ	είμαι	εδώ.	Είμαι	εδώ	και	εγώ	[íme	edhó	ke	eghó].	Είμαι	και	
    εδώ,	 it	 means,	 I’m	 here	 as	 well	 as	 somewhere	 else,	 which	 might	 fit	 in	 some	
    context,	but,	I’m	also	here,	me	as	well	as	you,	as	well	as	someone	else:	Είμαι	εδώ	
    και	εγώ,	Και	εγώ	είμαι	εδώ.	I’m	in	the	car.		
	
S:	 Είμαι	στο	αυτοκίνητο	[íme	sto	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Good.	Είμαι	στο	αυτοκίνητο.	I’m	not	in	the	car?		
	
S:	 Δεν	είμαι	στο	αυτοκίνητο	[dhen	íme	sto	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Δεν	είμαι	στο	αυτοκίνητο.	The	word	for,	You	are,	is	είσαι	[íse].	Είσαι.		
	
S:	 Είσαι.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	our	informal	“you”,	again.	And	we	see	that	we	have	the	S	(σ/ς)	for	you	
    again,	as	we	do	in	θέλεις,	περιμένεις.	Here	just	the	verb	“to	be”	is	irregular,	like	in	
    English.	We	have	“be”,	“am”,	“is”,	“are”,	and	that’s	all	the	same	verb.	So	here	in	
    Greek	as	well	it’s	irregular,	although	we	are	seeing	some	logic	to	it:	είμαι,	we	are	
    having	the	“μαι”	[me]	in	there	for	“me/I”;	είσαι	having	the	S	in	there	that	refers	to	
    “you”,	as	in	σε	[se],	as	in	εσύ	[esí],	as	in	our	verbal	endings.	How	would	you	say,	
    You	are,	emphasising	the	word	for	you?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	είσαι	[esí	íse].	
	
T:	 Εσύ	είσαι.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	I	am,	using	the	word	for	“I”?		
	


                                                                                                   69
S:	 Εγώ	είμαι	[eghó	íme].		
	
T:	 Εγώ	είμαι.	I	also	want	to	mention	that	the	[e]	of,	είμαι,	είναι,	είσαι,	that	[e]	sound	
    οn	the	end,	is	written	AI	(αι)	in	all	of	these	cases.	Είμαι/είναι/είσαι	[íme/íne/íse].	
    Like	in,	και	[κε],	the	word	for	“and”,	which	was	K-A-I.	So	this	is	another	example	of	
    that	AI	(αι)	in	Greek,	together	giving	us	[e].	Again,	You	are?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	είσαι	[esí	íse].		
	
T:	 Εσύ	είσαι.	The	word	for	“well”	is	καλά	[kalá].	Καλά.		
	
S:	 Καλά.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	Are	you	well?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	καλά;	[íse	kalá?].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	 καλά;	 So	 the	 K	 [k]	 is	 softer	 in	 Greek.	 Now,	 depending	 on	 your	 native	
    language,	 you	 might	 feel	 like	 you’re	 hearing	 a	 G.	 Many	 English	 speakers	 for	
    example,	native	English	speakers,	might	feel	like	they’re	hearing	a	G	on	καλά.	But	
    it’s	actually	a	soft	K,	not	as	plosive,	not	as	hard	as	we	would	say	it	in	English.	In	
    English	we	would	say	it	like,	Κκαλά,	no?	But	in	Greek	it’s	softer,	καλά.	But	it’s	a	K.	
    Are	you	well?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	καλά;	[íse	kalá?].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	καλά;	How	would	you	say,	Be	well?	You	should	be	well.	You	ought	to	be	well.	
    How	do	you	think	you	might	build	that?		
	
S:	 Να	είσαι	καλά	[na	íse	kalá].		
	
T:	 Να	είσαι	καλά.	Good.	You	will	hear	very	often	in	Greek,	Να	’σαι	καλά	[na’se	kalá],	
    να	’σαι	καλά.	Να	’σαι	is	just	να	and	είσαι	contracted.	Να	’σαι	καλά,	Be	well.	You	
    will	often	hear	this	also	when	you	do	something	for	somebody:	Να	’σαι	καλά	–	Be	
    well,	like	a	“thank	you”.	Να	’σαι	καλά,	as	a	goodbye.	Be	well	–	να	’σαι	καλά,	you	
    will	hear	this.	How	would	you	say,	Are	you	here?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	εδώ;	[íse	edhó?].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	εδώ;	Where	are	you?		
	
S:	 Πού	είσαι;	[pu	íse?].		
	
T:	 Πού	 είσαι;	 This	 is	 something	 else	 you	 will	 hear	 very	 often	 in	 Greek	 as	 well,	 as	 a	
    term	 of	 endearment.	 Πού	 είσαι;	 Where	 have	 you	 been?	 So	 it’s	 something	 like	
    Where	have	you	been?	But	also,	you	can	use	it	with	somebody	that	you	never	met	




                                                                                                  70
    before.	I	don’t	know,	for	example	if	you	meet	a	cute	child,	you	can	just	say,	Πού	
    είσαι;	This	is	just	a	term	of	endearment,	which	shouldn’t	be	taken	too	literally.		
	




                                                                                   71

Teacher:	How	would	you	say,	We	are	waiting	here?		
	
Student:	Περιμένουμε	εδώ	[periménume	edhó].		
	
T:	 Περιμένουμε	 εδώ.	 Good.	 So	 that’s	 our	 standard,	 simple	 sentence,	 let’s	 say.	
    Περιμένουμε	εδώ.	But	if	we	stick	να	at	the	beginning,	we’re	going	to	understand	
    that	something	else,	some	extra	feeling,	now,	it’s	coming	with	this	sentence.	So	in	
    these	cases,	starting	the	sentences	with	να	—	να	is	just	alerting	us	to	the	fact	that	
    there	is	something	else	going	on.	But	what	that	is	exactly,	we’re	going	to	show	it	
    with	the	tone	of	voice.	So,		if	you	wanted	to	say,	for	example,	Shall	we	wait	here?		
	
S:	 Να	περιμένουμε	εδώ;	[na	periménume	edhó?].		
	
T:	 And	if	you	wanted	to	say,	Let’s	wait	here?		
	
S:	 Να	περιμένουμε	εδώ.		
	
T:	 Να	 περιμένουμε	 εδώ.	 So	 just	 with	 the	 tone	 of	 voice	 and	 that	 little	 να,	 that	 is	
    alerting	the	ear	of	the	listener,	you	can	achieve	these	different	meanings	that	we	
    use	–	shall	or	should	or	let’s	–	to	show,	in	English.	Shall	we	wait	for	you	here?		
	
S:	 Να	σε	περιμένουμε	εδώ;	[na	se	periménume	edhó?].		
	
T:	 Να	σε	περιμένουμε	εδώ;	Do	you	want	us	to	wait	for	you	here?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις	να	σε	περιμένουμε	εδώ;	[thélis	na	se	periménume	edhó?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλεις	να	σε	περιμένουμε	εδώ;	Very	good.	The	house,	in	Greek,	is,	το	
    σπίτι	[to	spíti].	Το	σπίτι.		
	
S:	 Το	σπίτι.		
	
T:	 What	gender	is	this?		
	
S:	 Ah,	neutral.		
	
T:	 Neuter,	very	good.	How	would	you	say,	I	am	in	the	house?		
	
S:	 Είμαι	στο	σπίτι	[íme	sto	spíti].		
	
T:	 Είμαι	 στο	 σπίτι.	 I’m	 in	 the	 house,	 or	 I’m	 at	 home.	 And	 with	 some	 structures	 or	
    with	some	words,	you	can	actually	leave	out	the	στο.	Like,	Είμαι	στο	σπίτι,	you	will	
    often	hear	in	Greek,	or	maybe	most	often	hear	in	Greek,	Είμαι	σπίτι	[íme	spíti].		
	
S:	 Είμαι	σπίτι.		


                                                                                              72
	
T:	 This	 person	 is	 not	 saying,	 I	 am	 a	 house.	 It’s	 understood,	 I’m	 in	 the	 house/I’m	 at	
    home.	 You	 couldn’t	 say,	 for	 example,	 Είμαι	 αυτοκίνητο.	 That	 really	 does	 sound	
    like,	I	am	a	car.	So	you	could	only	do	it	sometimes.	But	of	course	if	you	say,	Είμαι	
    στο	σπίτι,	it’s	perfectly	correct.	How	would	you	say,	Are	you	at	home?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	στο	σπίτι;	[íse	sto	spíti?].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	 στο	 σπίτι/Είσαι	 σπίτι;	 Good.	 So	 we	 had	 είμαι	 for,	 I	 am,	 and	 είσαι	 –	 this	 S	
    occurring	again	for	“you”	–	for,	You	are.	Είσαι.	Aren’t	you	at	home?		
	
S:	 Δεν	είσαι	στο	σπίτι;	[dhen	íse	sto	spíti?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	είσαι	στο	σπίτι/Δεν	είσαι	σπίτι;	Why	aren’t	you	at	home?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	δεν	είσαι	στο	σπίτι;	[yatí	dhen	íse	sto	spíti?].		
	
T:	 Γιατί	δεν	είσαι	στο	σπίτι;	Shall	we	do	it?		
	
S:	 Να	το	κάνουμε;	[na	to	kánume?].		
	
T:	 Να	το	κάνουμε;	And	how	would	you	say,	Let’s	do	it?		
	
S:	 Να	το	κάνουμε.		
	
T:	 Να	το	κάνουμε.	The	word	for	“after”	or	for	“later”,	used	a	lot	like	“later”	in	Greek,	
    is,	μετά	[metá].	Μετά.		
	
S:	 Μετά.		
	
T:	 We	 have	 this	 in	 English:	 a	 metaphor,	 metaphysics,	 no?	 Μετά	 is	 after,	 beyond.	
    Beyond	physics	–	metaphysics.	Shall	we	do	it	later?		
	
S:	 Να	το	κάνουμε	μετά;	[na	to	kánume	metá?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Να	το	κάνουμε	μετά;	Let’s	do	it	later.		
	
S:	 Να	το	κάνουμε	μετά.		
	
T:	 Να	το	κάνουμε	μετά.	Good.	What	shall	we	do	later?		
	
S:	 Τι	κάνουμε	μετά;	[ti	kánume	metá?].		
	
T:	 So,	Τι	κάνουμε	μετά;	is	just	a	straightforward	sentence,	What	are	we	doing	later.		
	
S:	 Ah,	okay.	Τι	να	κάνουμε	μετά;	[ti	na	kánume	metá?].		
	


                                                                                                 73
T:	 Very	good.	Τι	να	κάνουμε	μετά;	So	again	this	is	a	great	example	of	the	differences	
    between	 the	 standard	 sentence,	 Tι	 κάνουμε	 μετά;	 (What	 are	 we	 doing	 later?),	
    and	then	the	feeling	that	that	να	gives	us:	Τι	να	κάνουμε	μετά;	(What	shall	we	do	
    later?).	The	word	for	“day”	in	Greek	is,	μέρα	[méra].		
	
S:	 Μέρα.		
	
T:	 Μέρα.	It’s	a	feminine	word.	So	how	would	you	say,	the	day?		
	
S:	 Η	μέρα	[i	méra].	
	
T:	 Η	μέρα.	Good.	The	word	for	“good”	is,	καλός	[kalós].	Καλός.		
	
S:	 Καλός.		
	
T:	 What	version	of	the	adjective	did	I	give	you?		
	
S:	 Masculine.		
	
T:	 The	masculine.	How	do	you	think	we’d	say,	Good	day?		
	
S:	 Καλή	μέρα	[kalí	méra].		
	
T:	 Καλημέρα	[kaliméra].	And	you	hear	this	all	the	time	in	Greek.	Καλημέρα.	It’s	one	
    word,	so	rather	than	καλή	μέρα,	the	accent	moves	because	it’s	joined	together	as	
    one	 word,	 καλημέρα.	 You	 will	 hear	 this	 very	 often	 in	 Greek.	 Σήμερα	 [símera],	
    σήμερα,	is	“today”.		
	
S:	 Σήμερα.		
	
T:	 Σήμερα.	What	shall	we	do	today?		
	
S:	 Τι	να	κάνουμε	σήμερα;	[ti	na	kánume	símera?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τι	να	κάνουμε	σήμερα;	Let’s	do	it	today.		
	
S:	 Να	το	κάνουμε	σήμερα	[na	to	kánume	símera].		
	
T:	 Να	το	κάνουμε	σήμερα.	Very	good.	Where	should	I	wait	for	you	today?		
	
S:	 Πού	να	σε	περιμένω	σήμερα;	[pu	na	se	periméno	símera?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Πού	 να	 σε	 περιμένω	 σήμερα;	 Very	 good.	 So,	 we’ve	 seen	 how,	 with	
    nouns,	we	can	have	masculine,	feminine,	or	neuter	nouns.	And	we	also	saw	that	
    names	are	masculine	or	feminine	as	well.	The	names	in	Greek	actually	go	with	the	
    words	for	“the”.	So	for	example,	if	we	speak	about	Andreas,	we	will	speak	about,	
    ο	Αντρέας.	If	we	speak	about	Alexandros,	we	will	speak	about,	ο	Αλέξανδρος.	We	


                                                                                         74
  will	say,	the	Alexander	is	waiting	for	you.	So	we	don’t	say,	Alexander	is	waiting	for	
  you,	in	Greek.	We	say,	the	Alexander	is	waiting	for	you.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Ο	Αλέξανδρος	σε	περιμένει	[o	aléksandhros	se	periméni].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ο	Αλέξανδρος	σε	περιμένει.	What	was,	here?		
	
S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
	
T:	 Εδώ.	The	word	for	“there”	is	εκεί	[ekí].	Εκεί.		
	
S:	 Εκεί.		
	
T:	 Good.	Alexander	is	waiting	for	me	there.	The	Alexander	is	waiting	for	me	there.		
	
S:	 Ο	Αλεξάνδρος	με	περιμένει	εκεί	[o	aleksándhros	me	periméni	ekí].		
	
T:	 Ο	Αλέξανδρος	με	περιμένει	εκεί	[o	aléksandhros	me	periméni	ekí].	Good.	We	can	
    also	use	να,		to	say	something	like,	Let	him	wait.	Let	him	wait.	How	do	you	think	
    you	would	do	that?		
	
S:	 Να	περιμένει	[na	periméni].		
	
T:	 Να	περιμένει	–	Let	him	wait!	Let	him	wait	for	me.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Να	με	περιμένει	[na	me	periméni].		
	
T:	 Να	με	περιμένει.	Let	him	wait	for	me	there.		
	
S:	 Να	με	περιμένει	εκεί	[na	me	periméni	ekí].		
	
T:	 Να	με	περιμένει	εκεί.	Good.	So,	if	you	are	going	to	say	something	like,	Maria	is	at	
    home	now,	again	you	will	say,	The	Maria	is	at	home	now.	What	is,	the	Maria?		
	
S:	 Η	Μαρία	είναι	στο	σπίτι	τώρα	[i	maría	íne	sto	spíti	tóra].		
	
T:	 Or,	H	Μαρία	είναι	σπίτι	τώρα	[i	maría	íne	spíti	tóra].	Very	good.	Maria	is	not	at	
    home.	She’s	waiting	for	you	here.		
	
S:	 Μαρία	δεν	είναι	στο	σπίτι	[maría	dhen	íne	sto	spiti].		
	
T:	 Good.	And	…	?		
	
S:	 Ah,	Η	Μαρία.	Η	Μαρία	δεν	είναι	στο	σπίτι	[i	maría	dhen	íne	sto	spiti].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Η	Μαρία	δεν	είναι	στο	σπίτι.	Η	Μαρία	δεν	είναι	σπίτι	[i	maría	dhen	íne	
    spiti].	She’s	waiting	for	you	here.		


                                                                                    75
	
S:	 Αυτή	σε	περιμένει	εδώ	[aftí	se	periméni	edhó].		
	
T:	 Good.	 And	 for	 …	 for	 sure,	 we	 wouldn’t	 need	 “αυτή”	 here,	 because	 we	 already	
    mentioned	Maria.	So	it’s	very	unnecessary.	We	know	who	we’re	talking	about,	so	
    we	don’t	need	to	say,	Αυτή	σε	περιμένει.	Η	Μαρία	δεν	είναι	σπίτι.	Σε	περιμένει	
    εδώ.	Generally,	if	we	don’t	need	to	use	these	words,	like	he,	she,	I	–	we	generally	
    won’t,	unless	we	want	to	be	emphatic.	How	would	you	say,	Where	is	Maria?		
	
S:	 Πού	είναι	Μαρία;	Πού	είναι	η	Μαρία;	[pu	íne	i	maría?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	είναι	η	Μαρία;	Η	Μαρία	πού	είναι;	[i	maría	pu	íne?].	Very	good.		
	




                                                                                        76
Complete	Greek,	Track	17	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:		So	we	saw	that	in	Greek,	we	have	gender,	no?	The	nouns,	words	that	we	
put	“the”	or	“a”	in	front	of	–	so	“the	road”,	“a	road”,	“the	apology”,	“an	apology”.	
Nouns	 can	 be	 either	 masculine,	 feminine,	 or	 neuter	 (no	 gender)	 in	 Greek.	 So,	 for	
example,	we	had	“apology”,	you	remember	how	that	was?	Apology?	So	just	start	and	
see	where	it	takes	you.		
	
Student:		Απολο	…	γιo?		
	
T:	 Close	enough,	huh?	Απολογία	[apoloyía].		
	
S:	 Απολογία.		
	
T:	 Απολογία,	no?	So	apology	is	a	feminine	word.	So	how	is,	The	apology?		
	
S:	 Η	απολογία	[i	apoloyía].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Η	Απολογία,	very	good.	So	feminine	nouns	take	[i]	(Η/η)	for	“the”.	We	
    also	saw,	η	πόλη	[i	póli].	That’s	another	feminine	word,	η	πόλη,	“the	city”,	as	in	
    “cosmopolitan”.	And	what	was	the	word	for,	this,	for	feminine	words?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	[aftí].		
	
T:	 Αυτή,	good.	That’s	“this”.	But	if	you	want	to	say,	This	apology?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	η	απολογία	[aftí	i	apoloyía].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	You	say	“this	the	apology”,	αυτή	η	απολογία.	Very	good.	And	this	will	
    blend	 together	 in	 spoken,	 no?	 So	 in	 spoken	 Greek	 it	 will	 just	 sound	 like,	 αυτή-
    απολογία.	No?	It’s	all	going	to	blend	together.	But	that’s	still	happening	–	αυτή	η	
    απολογία.	And	we	said	that	this	[i]	(η)	sound	that	we	have	for	feminine,	αυτή,	[i]	
    is	written	with	that	letter	that	looks	like	a	“n”	with	a	long	tail	finishing	below	the	
    line,	or	a	H	in	capitals	(η/Η).	What	else	does	this	αυτή	mean,	other	than	“this”	or	
    “this	one”	for	feminine	nouns,	what	else	does	it	mean,	αυτή?		
	
S:	 She.		
	
T:	 Good,	she.	So	how	would	you	say,	She	wants,	emphasising	she?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	θέλει	[aftí	théli].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	θέλει.	Good.	What	was	the	word	for,	what?		
	
S:	 Τι	[ti].		
	
T:	 Τι,	τι.	“Something”	–	the	word	for	something	in	Greek	is	κάτι	[káti].	Κάτι.		


                                                                                             77
	
S:	 Κάτι.		
	
T:	 And	 that’s	 related,	 if	 you	 think	 about	 it.	 “What”	 doesn’t	 refer	 to	 anything	
    particularly,	and	“something”	is	the	next	step	up,	no,	to	not	referring	to	anything	
    particularly.	So	we	have	τι	–	what,	and	κατι	–	something.	So	how	would	you	say,	
    She	wants	something	from	the	house?	So	let’s	start	with,	She	wants.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	θέλει	[aftí	théli].		
	
T:	 Something?		
	
S:	 Κάτι.		
	
T:	 From.	What’s,	from?		
	
S:	 Από	[apó].		
	
T:	 Από,	 good.	 So	 in	 απολογία,	 we	 have,	 from,	 there	 starting	 the	 word	 –	 από	 the	
    house.		
	
S:	 Από	το	σπίτι	[apó	to	spíti].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θέλει	 κάτι	 από	 το	 σπίτι	 [théli	 káti	 apó	 to	 spíti].	 And	 you	 might	 also	
    hear,	 you	 will	 commonly	 hear,	 Θέλει	 κάτι	 άπ’	 το	 σπίτι	 [théli	 káti	 áp’to	 spíti].	 So,	
    από	το,	can	contract	to,	άπ’	το	[áp’to].		
	
S:	 Απ’	το.		
	
T:	 Απ’	το.	We	saw	this	as	well	with	στο	–	σε	το	(“to	the”)	can	contract	to,	στο.	So	the	
    same	thing	is	happening;	we’re	just	losing	the	last	vowel	of	σε	(στο),	από	(άπ’	το).	
    We	 also	 saw	 the	 word,	 δρόμος	 [dhrómos]	 for	 road,	 and	 what	 kind	 of	 noun	 is	
    δρόμος?		
	
S:	 Ο	δρόμος	[o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	what	does	that	mean,	ο	δρόμος?	What	kind	of	noun	is	it?		
	
S:	 Μasculine.		
	
T:	 Masculine,	very	good.	And	then	how	would	you	say,	this	road?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	δρόμος	[aftós	o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτός	ο	δρόμος,	very	good.	You	might	know	the	word	“palindrome”.	
    Do	 you	 know	 this	 word,	 palindrome?	 Or	 maybe	 there’s	 something	 similar	 in	
    Spanish,	palindromo?		


                                                                                                  78
	
S:	 Palindromo,	yes,	but	I	don’t	know	what	it	means.		
	
T:	 Well	actually	it	means	a	word	that’s	spelt	the	same	way	forward	and	backwards,	
    so	like	“mum”.		
	
S:	 Mum,	okay.		
	
T:	 It’s	spelt	the	same	forward	and	backwards,	and	if	we	divide	it	up,	“palindrome”,	
    we	 see	 that	 we	 have	 “pali”	 which	 in	 Greek	 means	 “again”	 –	 πάλι	 [páli],	 and	
    “drome”.	What	is	drome?		
	
S:	 Way.		
	
T:	 Way,	 road.	 Exactly	 so	 it’s	 again	 “road”,	 no?	 Palindrome	 reads	 the	 same	 way	
    forward	and	backwards.	But	from	this	we	can	take,	πάλι	which	means	“again”.		
	
S:	 Πάλι.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	he,	and	let’s	emphasise	he.	He	doesn’t	want	to	do	it	again.		
	
S:	 Αυτός	δεν	θέλει	να	κάνει	πάλι	[aftós	dhen	théli	na	káni	páli].	
	
T:	 Very	good,	very	good,	you	took	it	through	very	well,	but	we	just	missed	the	“it”,	
    the	it.	He	doesn’t	want	to	do	it	again.		
	
S:	 Ah,	okay.	Αυτός	δεν	θέλει	να	το	κάνει	πάλι	[aftós	dhen	théli	na	to	káni	páli].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Αυτός	 δεν	 θέλει	 να	 το	 κάνει	 πάλι.	 Very	 good.	 And	 we	 mentioned	 as	
    well	before,	that	αυτή/αυτός,	is	spelt	with	A-U,	and	that	this	combination	of	AU	
    are	the	Greek	letters	that	look	like	a	and	u,	is	giving	us	[af].	The	word	for	book,	do	
    you	remember	the	word	for	book?	It	was	related	to	Bible.		
	
S:	 Βιβλίο	[vivlío].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	βιβλίο,	very	good.	It’s	written	with	the	βήτα	[víta]	that	looks	like	a	B,	
    but	we	pronounce	V	there,	no?	Βιβλίο.	Very	good.	The	book?		
	
S:	 Ο	βιβλίο	[o	vivlío].		
	
T:	 What	gender	is	βιβλίο?		
	
S:	 Um,	masculine,	no	–	το	βιβλίο	[to	vivlío].		
	
T:	 Το	βιβλίο,	it’s	neuter.	We’ve	seen	that	our	masculine	nouns	end	in	S.	Το	βιβλίο,	
    neuter.	How	would	you	say,	This	book?		
	


                                                                                          79
S:	 Αυτό	το	βιβλίο	[aftó	to	vivlío].		
	
T:	 Good,	αυτό	το	βιβλίο.	Very	good.	The	word	for	“thing”	is	πράγμα	[prághma].	So	
    there	we	have	the	G	from	the	throat,	like	in	εγώ	[eghó].	Πράγμα.		
	
S:	 Πράγμα.		
	
T:	 So	that	means	“thing”.	Can	you	relate	that	to	anything?		
	
S:	 Pragmatic?		
	
T:	 Pragmatic,	 exactly.	 So	 pragmatism,	 pragmatic,	 there	 we	 just	 have	 the	 word	 for	
    “thing”	in	Greek.	Πράγμα.	The	words	that	we	saw	that	end	in	MA	in	Greek,	that	
    are	 similar	 or	 the	 same	 in	 English,	 they	 are	 also	 neuter	 words.	 So	 we	 saw,	 το	
    άρωμα	[to	ároma],	το	πανόραμα	[to	panórama],	το	διάγραμμα	[to	diághrama].	So	
    “το”	 in	 Greek,	 το	 πρόβλημα	 [to	 próvlima],	 το	 σύστημα	 [to	 sístima].	 How	 would	
    you	say,	This	thing?		
	
S:	 Αυτό	το	πράγμα	[aftó	to	prághma].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτό	το	πράγμα	(“this	the	thing”).	And	of	course	πράγμα	is	neuter,	ending	
    MA,	like	πρόβλημα,	etc.	Give	me	again	the	word	for,	what?		
	
S:	 Τι	[ti].		
	
T:	 Τι.	And	the	word	for,	something?		
	
S:	 Κάτι	[káti].		
	
T:	 Κάτι.	And	what	was	why?		
	
S:	 Γιάτι	[yáti].		
	
T:	 Γιατί	[yatí].	So,	γιατί	means	“because	of	what”	or	“for	what”.	This	για	all	by	itself	
    means	 “because	 of”	 or	 “for”.	 So	 αυτό,	 αυτό	 –	 we	 don’t	 just	 use	 this	 for	 neuter	
    nouns,	 but	 also	 for	 situations,	 no?	 A	 situation,	 for	 example,	 doesn’t	 have	 any	
    gender.	 If	 we	 say	 “because	 of	 this”,	 what	 is	 the	 “this”?	 Is	 it	 masculine;	 is	 it	
    feminine?	No,	it’s	nothing,	it’s	neuter.	So	για	by	itself	is	“because	of”	or	“for”.	If	
    you	want	to	say,	Because	of	this?		
	
S:	 Για	αυτό	[ya	aftó].		
	
T:	 Για	αυτό.	What	was,	I	do,	or	I	make?		
	
S:	 Κάνω	[káno].		
	




                                                                                               80
T:	 Κάνω.	So	if	you	want	to	say	a	sentence	in	English	like,	That’s	why	I’m	not	doing	it.	
    That’s	 why	 I’m	 not	 doing	 it	 –	 you	 will	 say,	 “Because	 of	 this	 I’m	 not	 doing	 it”,	 in	
    Greek.	Sο	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Για	αυτό	δεν	το	κάνω	[ya	aftó	dhen	to	káno].		
	
T:	 Good.	Για	αυτό	δεν	το	κάνω.	What	was,	I	can?	I	can,	or	I’m	able	to.	It	was	a	bit	of	
    an	 odd	 verb	 in	 that	 it	 carried	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 ending.	 Do	 you	 remember	 how	
    that	was?	I	can?		
	
S:	 Μπορώ,	μπορώ	[boró].		
	
T:	 Μπορώ.	So,	if	you	want	to	say,	That’s	why	I	can’t	do	it	...	Because	of	this	I	can’t	do	
    it.		
	
S:	 Για	αυτό	δεν	μπορώ	να	κάνω	[ya	aftó	dhen	boró	na	káno].		
	
T:	 And	the	“it”?		
	
S:	 Okay.	Να	το	κάνω.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Για	αυτό	δεν	μπορώ	να	το	κάνω	[ya	aftó	dhen	boró	na	to	káno].	That’s	
    why	we	can’t	do	it	again.	So	we	will	just	begin	with	the	first	thing.	What’s	the	first	
    thing	we	have	to	think	about?	That’s	why	we	can’t	do	it	again.		
	
S:	 Για	αυτό.		
	
T:	 Good.	We	can’t.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορούμε	[dhen	borúme].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορούμε.	Do	it	again.		
	
S:	 Να	το	κάνουμε	πάλι	[na	to	kánume	páli].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	very	good.	Για	αυτό	δεν	μπορούμε	να	το	κάνουμε	πάλι	[ya	aftó	dhen	
    borúme	na	to	kánume	páli].	“For	example”,	in	Greek.	For	example,	if	you	want	to	
    say,	for	example,	something	you	can	throw	in	the	middle	of	many	sentences,	no,	
    is	“for	paradigm”.	For	paradigm.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Για	παραδίμε?	Παράδειγμα.		
	
T:	 Good.	Παράδειγμα.	Για	παράδειγμα	[ya	parádhighma].	For	example.		
	




                                                                                                    81
Complete	Greek,	Track	18	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	 So	 we	 said,	 βήτα	 [víta],	 the	 βήτα	 (Β/β),	 the	 letter	 that	 looks	 like	 a	 B,	 is	
    pronounced	like	a	V	sound	in	Greek,	like	in	the	word,	book,	which	is	…	?		
	
Student:	Βιβλίο	[vivlío].		
		
T:	 Βιβλίο.	Or,	problem,	which	is	…	?		
		
S:	 Πρόβλημα	[próvlima].		
		
T:	 Πρόβλημα,	good.	Which	frees	up	the	V	letter,	no?	That	means	that	we	have	a	V	
    letter	in	Greek	that	is	free	to	make	another	sound.	The	V	letter	in	Greek,	or	the	
    letter	that	looks	like	a	V	in	Greek,	gives	us	the	N	sound	[n].	So	that	means	κάνω	
    [káno]	–	I	do,	or	I	make	–	is	spelt	k-a-v-w.	Let’s	say	W,	that	[o]	sound	–	we	saw	it’s	
    written	with	the	ωμέγα	[omégha]	(ω/Ω)	when	it’s	the	verb	ending	for	“I”,	no,	[o]	
    that	looks	like	a	W	(ω)	in	small	letters.	Now	it	might	look	like	“kavw”,	no?	This	is	
    κάνω	[káno].		
		
S:	 Κάνω.		
	
	T:	Να/να,	like	when	we	say,	θέλω	να	κάνω,	then	is	not	written	“n-a”;	to	our	eyes	it	is	
    written	“v-a”.	So	this	letter	that	looks	like	a	V	gives	us	an	[n]	sound	in	Greek.	Also	
    the	word	for	yes	in	Greek,	which	is,	ναι	[ne],	is	written	with	that	letter	that	looks	
    like	a	V,	and	then	a-i;	AI	(αι)	gives	us	[e].	We	saw	that	in	the	word	for,	and,	spelt	
    k-a-i	(και	[ke]).	What	was,	And?		
		
S:	 Και	[ke].		
		
T:	 Και.	 This	 might	 have	 something	 to	 do	 with	 the	 connection	 between	 the	 names	
    Victor	and	Nicholas.	These	are	the	same	name	from	Greek	and	Latin.	Nicholas	is	
    the	Greek	and	means	“Victor	of	the	people”	or	“over	the	people”	–	who	knows?	
    We	 have	 νικάω	 [nikáo],	 which	 means	 “to	 win”	 or	 “to	 defeat”.	 That’s	 a	 verb	 you	
    can	 use	 still	 in	 Greek,	 νικάω	 –	 to	 win,	 or	 defeat.	 Actually	 the	 brand	 name	 Nike	
    comes	from	the	same	root.	And	then,	ο	λαός,	which	is	“the	people”.	So	Nicholas	–	
    νικάω	ο	λαός	–	Νικόλαος,	in	Greek.	Nicholas	–	Νικόλαος.	What	gender	is,	ο	λαός	–	
    the	people?		
		
S:	 Masculine.		
		
T:	 Masculine.	 You	might	be	familiar	with	the	English	“layman”	or	“layperson”?	You	
    know	this	word	in	English?		
		
S:	 Yes.		
		
T:	 It	 refers	 to	 somebody	 that’s	 not	 a	 professional.	 So	 this	 just	 means	 “people	
    person”.	So	we	have	the	V	giving	us	a	[n],	an	N	sound	in	Greek.	But	if	you	see	the	


                                                                                                 82
   name	Nicholas	written,	with	a	capital	N,	you	will	see	a	capital	N	in	Greek.	So	this	
   letter	changes	quite	drastically	between	its	small	version,	which	looks	like	a	V,	and	
   its	 big	 version	 that	 looks	 like	 a	 capital	 N.	 We	 already	 saw	 how	 Greek	 can	
   sometimes	vary	quite	a	bit	between	small	and	capital	letters.	We	saw	this	with	the	
   feminine	[i]	ending	(η/Η),	no,	like	in	the	word	for	she,	which	is	…	?		
		
S:	 Αυτή	[aftí].		
		
T:	 Αυτή.	And	how	do	we	spell	that	[i]	sound?		
		
S:	 With	a	long	“n”.		
		
T:	 Yeah,	like	an	“n”	that	carries	on	down	below	that	line.	And	in	capitals,	what	does	
    that	letter	look	like?	It	changes	quite	drastically.		
		
S:	 H?		
		
T:	 Like	a	capital	H.	So	we’ve	seen	a	couple	of	examples	of	the	small	and	big	letters	
    varying	quite	a	lot	in	Greek.	We	have	the	small	V	giving	us	[n],	and	then	the	big	N.	
    We	have	our	[i]	sound,	used	notably	as	a	feminine	ending,	with	its	two	versions	
    looking	either	like	an	“n”,	whose	tail	goes	down	beyond	the	line,	or	its	capital,	like	
    a	capital	H.	We	saw	the	ωμέγα	[omégha]	(ω/Ω),	giving	us	the	[o]	sound,	notably	
    with	verbs,	to	show	that	it	is	“I”:	εγώ	[eghó],	θέλω	[thélo],	περιμένω	[periméno],	
    and	 we	 saw	 how	 that’s	 written	 with	 a	 W	 as	 a	 small	 letter	 (ω),	 and	 then	 as	 a	
    capital,	we	have	that	rounded	top	hat	shape	(Ω).	We’ve	also	mentioned	the	U,	as	
    in	 AU	 (αυ),	 giving	 us,	 αυτό	 [aftó],	 but	 when	 that’s	 a	 capital,	 it	 looks	 like	 a	 Y	
    (“ΑΥΤΟ”).	 It	 looks	 like	 a	 capital	 Y.	 So	 that’s	 another	 one	 that	 changes	 quite	
    drastically.	Don’t	worry	about	memorising	these	of	course.	We	will	reconsider	the	
    examples	many	times.	For	now,	we	just	want	to	understand	that	small	and	capital	
    letters	can	vary	quite	drastically	in	Greek.

Teacher:	“The	catastrophe”.	Τhe	catastrophe	in	Greek	is,	η	καταστροφή	[i	katastrofí].	
    Η	καταστροφή.		
		
Student:	Η	καταστροφή.		
		
T:	 So	catastrophe,	or	καταστροφή	in	Greek,	actually	means	“downturn”.	So	that	first	
    part,	κατ/κατα	[kat/kata],	it	means	“down”.	And	actually	we	have	the	word	κάτω	
    [káto]	 in	 Greek	 meaning	 down	 or	 under.	 So	 that	 κατ	 is	 a	 common	 part	 of	 other	
    words;	we’re	going	to	come	across	it	a	lot.	But	also	is	a	word	in	itself,	you	will	hear	
    that	 used	 very	 commonly	 in	 Greek	 –	 κάτω.	 For	 example,	 you	 can	 say	 “I	 am	
    downstairs”,	 you	 know:	 I	 am	 down,	 I	 am	 outside,	 like	 waiting	 in	 somebody’s	
    building.	You	remember	how	was,	I	am?		
		
S:	 Είμαι	[íme].		
		
T:	 Είμαι.	Good.	So,	I	am	down?		
		
S:	 Είμαι	κάτω	[íme	káto].		
		
T:	 Είμαι	κάτω.	How	would	you	ask,	Are	you	down?		
		
S:	 Είμαι	κάτω;	No	…		
		
T:	 In	the	word,	είμαι,	we	have	the	[m]	there	that’s	relating	to	like	“me”	and	“I”,	no?	
    What	is	the	sound	that	relates	to	you,	with	the	verbs?		
		
S:	 S?		
		
T:	 Αn	S.	If	you	were	to	replace	that	[m]	with	a	[s]	…		
		
S:	 Umm.	Είσαι?		
		
T:	 Good,	είσαι.	So,	Are	you	down?	Are	you	downstairs?		
		
S:	 Είσαι	κάτω;	[íse	káto?].		
		
T:	 Good.	Είσαι	κάτω;	Are	you	down?	Are	you	downstairs?	And	for	he,	she,	and	it?	It	
    is,	she	is,	it	is	–	what	did	we	have?		
		
S:	 Είναι	[íne].		
		
T:	 Είναι.	It	is	down,	it’s	down,	she’s	down.		
		
S:	 Είναι	κάτω	[íne	káto].		
		


                                                                                            84
T:	 Good,	 good.	 Κατεβαίνω	 [katevéno].	 Κατεβαίνω	 means	 “to	 go	 down”	 or	 “to	 get	
    off”,	 a	 train,	 for	 example,	 you	 know?	 To	 get	 down	 from	 the	 train	 or	 the	 bus	 or	
    what	have	you.	Κατεβαίνω.		
		
S:	 Κατεβαίνω.		
		
T:	 He	is	doing	down.		
		
S:	 Αυτός	κατεβαίνω	[aftós	katevéno].		
		
T:	 You	don’t	need	the	αυτός	really.	No?	We	should	hear	it	in	the	ending	of	the	verb.	
    So	how	would	that	be?		
		
S:	 Ah!	Κατεβαίνει	[katevéni].		
		
T:	 Very	good.	Κατεβαίνει.	He	is	getting	down	off	the	train.	“The	train”	is,	το	τρένο	[to	
    tréno].		
		
S:	 Τρένο.		
		
T:	 Good	,	το	τρένο.	So,	He	is	getting	down	off	the	train	–	from	the	train.		
		
S:	 Κατεβαίνει	από	το	τρένο	[katevéni	apó	to	tréno].		
		
T:	 Very	good.	Κατεβαίνει	από	το	τρένο.	Or	what	could	we	hear	instead	of,	από	το?		
		
S:	 Απ’	το	[áp’to].		
		
T:	 Απ’	 το.	 Very	 common	 in	 spoken	 Greek,	 uh?	 Κατεβαίνει	 άπ’	 το	 τρένο	 [katevéni	
    áp’to	 tréno].	 Aren’t	 you	 getting	 off	 here?	 Aren’t	 you	 getting	 off/getting	 down	
    here?	What	was	the	word	for,	here?		
		
S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
		
T:	 Εδώ.	 Very	 good,	 εδώ.	 So	 when	 you	 are	 trying	 to	 remember	 a	 word,	 rather	 than	
    seeing	 if	 you	 remember	 the	 whole	 word,	 just	 see	 if	 you	 can	 remember	 how	 it	
    starts,	and	that’s	usually	enough	to	trigger	you	to	get	the	whole	word	–	εδώ.	So,	
    Aren’t	you	getting	down	here?		
		
S:	 Δεν	κατεβαίνεις	εδώ;	[dhen	katevénis	edhó?].		
		
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 κατεβαίννεις	 εδώ;	 “I	 understand”	 in	 Greek	 is,	 καταλαβαίνω	
    [katalavéno].	Καταλαβαίνω.		
		
S:	 Καταλαβαίνω.		
		




                                                                                               85
T:	 Good.	 So	 that’s	 all	 one	 word.	 And	 it	 is	 just	 like	 English	 if	 you	 think	 about	 it.	 In	
    English	 you	 say	 “under-stand”.	 Here	 we	 have	 κατα	 [kata]	 of	 course,	 giving	 us	
    “under”,	and	λαβαίνω	[lavéno]	comes	from	the	word	meaning	something	like	“to	
    take”	 or	 “to	 receive”.	 So	 in	 Greek	 you	 say	 to	 under-take	 or	 to	 under-receive.	
    Καταλαβαίνω.	 Now	 this	 is	 a	 long	 word.	 If	 you	 were	 to	 look	 that	 up	 in	 the	
    dictionary,	you	might	have	a	hard	time	digesting	that,	no?	Lots	of	vowels,	a	long	
    word.	You	might	mix	some	of	the	vowel	sounds	up:	“katalev”	…	how	was	it?	But	if	
    you	 are	 very	 conscious	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 it’s	 built	 of	 κατα	 [kata]	 and	 λαβαίνω	
    [lavéno],	 and	 you	 digest	 it	 that	 way	 when	 you	 come	 across	 the	 word,	 it	 stays	 in	
    your	 memory	 much	 easier,	 no?	 And	 this	 isn’t	 memorising,	 this	 is	 thinking	 about	
    the	language	in	a	certain	way,	and	the	result	of	that	is	just	remembering	it	better.	
    Κατα,	καταλαβαίνω.	I	don’t	understand.		
		
S:	 Δεν	καταλαβαίνω	[dhen	katalavéno].		
		
T:	 Δεν	καταλαβαίνω.	Good.	So	we	had	[e]	sound	with	κατεβαίνω	–	to	go	down.	And	
    then	 an	 [a]	 sound	 κατα,	 καταλαβαίνω.	 So	 what	 we	 have	 in	 common	 is	 the	 κατ	
    [kat],	 but	 we	 might	 have	 κατε	 [κατε],	 κατα	 [κατα],	 when	 it’s	 forming	 part	 of	
    another	word.	I	don’t	understand	you.	How	would	that	be?		
		
S:	 Δεν	σε	καταλαβαίνω	[dhen	se	katalavéno].		
		
T:	 Δεν	σε	καταλαβαίνω.	Δεν	σε	καταλαβαίνω.	Very	good.	We	don’t	understand	you.		
		
S:	 Δεν	σε	καταλαβαίνομε	[dhen	se	katalavénome].		
		
T:	 Ουμε	 [ume].	 We	 have	 ουμε	 [ume]	 for	 “we”.	 Δεν	 σε	 καταλαβαίνουμε	 [dhen	 se	
    katalavénume].	The	word	for	“we”	is	εμείς	[emís].	Εμείς.		
		
S:	 Εμείς.		
		
T:	 So	if	you	wanted	to	be	emphatic.	So	maybe	somebody	is	telling	you,	I	don’t	know	
    why	he	doesn’t	understand	me.	And	you	might,	you	know,	reply	emphatically,	We	
    don’t	 understand	 you.	 What	 are	 you	 talking	 about?	 We	 don’t	 understand	 you,	
    using	the	word	for	“we”,	how	would	that	be?		
		
S:	 Εμείς	δεν	σε	καταλαβαίνουμε	[emís	dhen	se	katalavénume].		
		
T:	 Very	good.	Εμείς	δεν	σε	καταλαβαίνουμε.	Very	good.	“I	drink”,	in	Greek,	is	πίνω	
    [píno].	Πίνω.		
		
S:	 Πίνω.		
		
T:	 Πίνω.	 For	 [p]	 in	 Greek,	 for	 the	 [p]	 sound,	 we	 have	 the	 letter	 (π/Π)	 which	 is	 like	
    that	mathematical	sign,	no?	Which	is	that	endless	number	that	has	something	to	
    do	with	a	circle.	We’ve	all	seen	that	around	somewhere;	it	looks	like	two	vertical	
    lines	with	a	horizontal	line	sitting	on	the	top.	Or	you	can	think	of	a	square	with	the	


                                                                                                     86
   bottom	line	missing;	it’s	that	shape.	And	then	the	[n]	sound,	what	does	it	look	like	
   there?		
		
S:	 Like	“vo”?	Like	a	V.		
		
T:	 Like	a	v,	in	small	letters.	Of	course	in	capitals	it	looks	like	a	capital	N.	Πίνω,	I	drink.	
    I	don’t	drink?		
		
S:	 Δεν	πίνω	[dhen	píno].		
		
T:	 Δεν	πίνω.	What	if	you	wanted	to	emphasise	“I”?	I	don’t	drink.		
		
S:	 Εγώ	δεν	πίνω	[eghó	dhen	píno].		
		
T:	 Εγώ	δεν	πίνω.	Do	you	drink?		
		
S:	 Πίνεις;	[pínis?].		
		
T:	 Πίνεις;	Πίνεις;	And	if	you	wanted	to	be	emphatic.	Do	you	drink?		
		
S:	 Εσυ	πίνεις;	[esí	pínis?].		
		
T:	 Εσυ	πίνεις;	Good.	We	don’t	drink,	emphasising	the	word	for	“we”.	We	don’t	drink.		
		
S:	 Εμείς	δεν	πίνουμε	[emís	dhen	pínume].		
		
T:	 Very	good.	Εμείς	δεν	πίνουμε.	Καταπίνω	[katapíno].	What	do	you	think	that	might	
    mean,	if	you	have	to	use	your	imagination?	Καταπίνω.		
		
S:	 To	drink	under	something?		
		
T:	 Exactly,	well	that’s	the	first	thing	you	should	do,	no?	You	should	firstly	translate	it	
    literally	and	see	if	that	gives	any	ideas.	So,	to	drink	down.	Does	that	give	you	any	
    ideas?	Or	just	visualising	it	–	drink	down.		
		
S:	 To	swallow.		
		
T:	 To	swallow,	to	swallow,	no?	Καταπίνω,	I	swallow.	So	you	will	really	see	this	κατα	
    [kata]	 doing	 the	 rounds	 in	 Greek.	 You	 will	 really	 find	 it	 around	 a	 lot.	 Another	
    example	–	we	have,	φέρνω	[férno],	which	means	“I	bring”.	Φέρνω.		
		
S:	 Φέρνω.		
		
T:	 Good.	And	again	the	N	sound	[n]	there,	written	like	a	V	shape.	Φέρνω	is	what	you	
    have	in	the	word	“periphery”.	We	have	περι	[peri];	we	know	what	that	means	–	
    around.	 And,	 to	 bring	 around	 –	 the	 “periphery”.	 Φέρνω.	 I’m	 bringing	 it.	 How	
    would	that	be?		


                                                                                              87
		
S:	 Το	φέρνω	[to	férno].		
		
T:	 Το	φέρνω.	We	are	bringing	it.		
		
S:	 Το	φέρνουμε	[to	férnume].		
		
T:	 Το	φέρνουμε.	We	are	bringing	the	car.		
		
S:	 Φέρνουμε	το	αυτοκίνητο	[férnume	to	aftokínito].		
		
T:	 Very	good.	Φέρνουμε	το	αυτοκίνητο.	Did	you	get	there	and	just	think	about	how	
    the	word	was	built	and	where	it	comes	from?		
		
S:	 Yeah,	I	knew	it	was,	αυτό,	and	then	I	didn’t	know	what	it	…		
		
T:	 Did	you	think	about	the	moving?		
		
S:	 Yeah.		
		
T:	 Good.	Αυτοκίνητο,	self-moving.	Φέρνουμε	το	αυτοκίνητο.	I	under-bring,	I	under-
    bring.	Καταφέρνω	[kataférno]	means	“I	manage”	–	in	the	sense	of	to	manage	to	
    do	 something.	 So	 for	 example,	 if	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 I’m	 managing	 to	 do	 it.	 I	 am	
    managing	to	do	it.	How	would	that	be?		
		
S:	 Καταφέρνω	να	κάνω	[kataférno	na	káno].		
		
T:	 Good.	And	your	special	“it”?		
		
S:	 Καταφέρνω	να	το	κάνω	[kataférno	na	to	káno].		
		
T:	 Καταφέρνω	να	το	κάνω.	So	you	have	to	make	an	extra	thought	to	make	sure	you	
    put	 it	 in.	 Καταφέρνω	 να	 το	 κάνω.	 Because	 of	 this	 …	 Because	 of	 this,	 I	 don’t	
    manage	to	do	it	again.	Because	of	this.

T:	 I	don’t	manage.

Teacher:	So	we	saw	in,	καταστροφή	(catastrophe)	the	use	of	κατ	[kat],	no,	which	can	
    be	 κατα	 [kata]	 like	 καταλαβαίνω,	 I	 understand,	 κατε	 [kate]	 like	 κατεβαίνω,	 I	 go	
    down.	But	we	also	have	the	second	part	of	that	word	to	look	at:	καταστροφή.	We	
    said	 this	 word	 meant,	 downturn,	 no?	 Kαταστροφή.	 Στροφή	 [strofí]	 in	 Greek	 is	
    “turning”,	 στροφή	 –	 turning,	 or	 the	 turning,	 η	 στροφή.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 this	
    turning?		
		
Student:	Αυτή	η	ιστροφή	[aftí	i	istrofí].		
		
T:	 Αυτή	η	στροφή	[aftí	i	strofí].		
		
S:	 But	στροφή	with	[s],	or	with	[i-s]?		
		
T:	 Ah,	with	[s].	And	your	mind	would	love	it	to	be	[i-s],	because	of	course	you’re	a	
    Spanish	 speaker.	 If	 you	 think,	 you	 have	 Spain/España,	 student/estudiante.	 So	
    that’s	a	language	transfer	that	will	come	from	Spanish,	and	you	might	notice	that	
    you	put	extra	vowels	around	in	Greek	when	you	start	“s-t”,	“s-p”.	And	just	being	
    aware	of	that	will	really	help	you	cut	it,	and	notice	it	if	it	happens.		
		
S:	 Στροφή.		
		
T:	 Good.	How	would	you	say,	It	is	this	turning?	It’s	this	turning.		
		
S:	 Είναι	αυτή	η	στροφή	[íne	aftí	i	strofí].		
		
T:	 Είναι	 αυτή	 η	 στροφή.	 Good.	 So	 when	 we	 have	 “ph”	 for	 an	 F	 sound	 in	 English,	
    when	we	use	“ph”	to	make	an	F	sound	in	English,	it	usually	means	that	the	word	
    has	come	from	Greek,	or	at	least	the	word	has	been	built	of	Greek	parts.	And	we	
    can	expect	it	to	be	the	same	or	similar	in	Greek.	So	we’ve	seen	this	already	with	
    the	 word	 καταστροφή/catastrophe,	 which	 we	 have	 in	 English	 and	 Greek.	 Of	
    course	that	F	sound	there	in	catastrophe	is	produced	with	“ph”	in	English.	What	
    was,	I	stay,	or	I’m	staying?		
		
S:	 Μένω	[méno].		
		
T:	 Μένω.	And	we	said	that	if	we	say	“I	on-stay”,	I	stay	on,	we	get	the	verb	for,	insist	–	
    epiphany,	episode	…		
		
S:	 Επιμένω	[epiméno].		
		
T:	 Επιμένω,	 good.	 We	 can	 use	 here,	 επιστρέφω	 [epistréfo].	 Επιστρέφω	 means	 …	
    maybe	you	can	guess	what	it	means?	If	we	have	στρέφω	from	στροφή,	meaning	
    “turn”,	no?	And	we	have	επι	[epi]	–	to	turn	on.	Again	if	you	visualise	that,	to	turn	
    on,	what	might	it	mean,	επιστρέφω?	So	what	happens	when	you	turn	on	a	point?	



                                                                                            90
   So	imagine	yourself	walking.	You	stop,	and	then	you	turn.	What	do	you	think	you	
   might	be	doing?		
		
S:	 Return.		
		
T:	 Returning.	Returning,	no?	So,	επιστρέφω	is,	I’m	returning,	I’m	coming	back.	How	
    would	you	say,	We’re	returning?		
		
S:	 Επιστρέφουμε	[epistréfume]?		
		
T:	 Επιστρέφουμε.	 Very	 good.	 We	 have	 “philosophy”	 in	 English.	 We	 have	 two	 PHs.	
    We	have	the	PH	of	philo	which	means	“love”	in	Ancient	Greek,	and	we	use	this	in	
    modern	Greek,	φίλος	[fílos]	to	mean	“friend”.	And	then	σοφία	[sofía]	is	“wisdom”.	
    So	 philosophy	 is	 a	 love	 of	 wisdom.	 So	 we	 said	 that	 φίλος	 is	 friend	 in	 Modern	
    Greek.	And	we	can	tell	by	this	S	(ς)	ending	that	it	refers	to	a	male.	Φίλος	is	friend	
    for	a	male	friend.	So	how	would	you	say,	the	friend?		
		
S:	 Ο	φίλος	[o	fílos].		
		
T:	 Ο	φίλος.	My	friend,	is	“the	friend	my”,	ο	φίλος	μου	[o	fílos	mu],	“the	friend	my”.	Ο	
    φίλος	μoυ.		
		
S:	 Ο	φίλος	μoυ.		
		
T:	 Good.	How	would	you	say,	My	friend	is	waiting	for	me,	or	“awaiting	me”	in	Greek?		
		
S:	 Ο	φίλος	μoυ	με	περιμένει	[o	fílos	mu	me	periméni].		
		
T:	 Good.	Ο	φίλος	μoυ	με	περιμένει.	My	friend	is	bringing	it.	So	periphery,	that	[feri]	
    that	should	help	you	remember,	I	bring.	What	is,	I	bring?		
		
S:	 Περι	...	φέρνω	[férno]?		
		
T:	 Φέρνω.		
		
S:	 Αh,	φέρνω.		
		
T:	 Just	by	itself,	uh?	Φέρνω.	So,	Μy	friend	is	bringing	it?		
		
S:	 Ο	φίλος	μου	το	φέρνει	[o	fílos	mu	to	férni].		
		
T:	 Very	good.	Ο	φίλος	μου	το	φέρνει.	So	we	said	that,	ο	φίλος,	of	course,	refers	to	a	
    male	friend.	And	how	would	you	make	that	refer	to	a	female	friend?		
		
S:	 Η	φίλη	[i	fíli].		
		




                                                                                            91
T:	 Η	φίλη.	Of	course,	η	φίλη.	So,	My	female	friend	is	waiting	for	me.	How	would	that	
    be?		
		
S:	 Ο	φίλη	...	ο	φίλη	μου?	[o	fíli	mu?].		
		
T:	 Ο	φίλη	μου?	It’s	a	bit	of	a	contradiction	there.		
		
S:	 Yes.	H	φίλη	μου?	[i	fíli	mu?].		
		
T:	 Η	φίλη	μου,	very	good	…	is	waiting	for	me.		
		
S:	 Με	περιμένει	[me	periméni].		
		
T:	 Very	good.	Η	φίλη	μου	με	περιμένει	[i	fíli	mu	me	periméni].	How	would	you	say,	
    My	 friend	 is	 returning	 tomorrow?	 Tomorrow	 in	 Greek	 is	 αύριο	 [ávrio].	 Αύριο,	
    tomorrow.		
		
S:	 Αύριο.		
		
T:	 Αύριο.	My	friend	is	returning	tomorrow,	and	we	mean	a	female	friend.		
		
S:	 Η	φίλη	μου	περι	...		
		
T:	 Returns.	 So	 you	 don’t	 remember	 it,	 but	 that’s	 not	 important.	 You	 know	 how	 to	
    find	it.	So	we	visualise	something,	we	thought	about	something.	How	would	you	
    do	…		
		
S:	 Περι,	no?	Go	around?		
		
T:	 So	the	“turn”	actually	was	the	verb,	not	the	περι.	But	on	–		turn	on.		
		
S:	 Επι?		
		
T:	 Good,	ah?	To	turn	on,	to	on-turn?		
		
S:	 Επιστρέφει?	Επιστρέφω!		
		
T:	 Επιστρέφω	[epistréfo].	Very	good,	ah?	Επιστρέφω.	So	that’s,	I	return.	And	when	
    we	 find	 that,	 not	 from	 memory,	 but	 thinking	 about	 how	 we	 split	 the	 word	 up,	
    thinking	about	what	we	related	it	to	–	when	we	arrive	at	the	word	through	that	
    process,	that	process	is	internalising	it.	And	it’s	actually	much	more	efficient	than	
    rote	memorisation,	even	though	it’s	something	that	you	do	slowly.	So,	My	friend	
    is	returning	tomorrow?	And	tomorrow	was,	αύριο.		
		
S:	 Η	φίλη	μου	επιστρέφει	αύριο	[i	fíli	mu	epistréfi	ávrio].		
		




                                                                                          92
T:	 Good.	Η	φίλη	μου	επιστρέφει	αύριο.	Good.	My	friend	is	not	returning	tomorrow.	
    Let’s	talk	about	a	male	friend	this	time.	My	friend	is	not	coming	back	tomorrow.		
		
S:	 Ο	φίλη	μου	…	ο	φίλος	μου	δεν	επιστρέφει	αύριο	[o	fílos	mu	dhen	epistréfi	ávrio].		
		
T:	 Very	good.	Ο	φίλος	μου	δεν	επιστρέφει	αύριο.	So	in	the	word	μου,	the	word	for	
    “my”,	 we	 have	 that	 M	 again	 relating	 back	 to	 me,	 no?	 What	 was	 the	 consonant	
    sound	that	was	relating	to	“you”,	in	Greek?		
		
S:	 The	…	S?		
		
T:	 The	S.	So,	μου	might	become?		
		
S:	 Σου	[su].		
		
T:	 Σου.	Very	good.	So,	your	friend?		
		
S:	 Ο	φίλος	σου	[o	fílos	su].		
		
T:	 Ο	φίλος	σου.	Very	good.	You	remember	the	word	for,	where?		
		
S:	 Πού	[pu].		
		
T:	 Πού.	Where	is	your	friend	–	the	friend	yours?		
		
S:	 Πού	είναι	ο	φίλος	σου;	[pu	íne	o	fílos	su?].		
		
T:	 Πού	είναι	ο	φίλος	σου;	Very	good.	And	the	word	order	is	quite	flexible	in	Greek.	
    You	 might	 hear,	 Ο	 φίλος	 σου	 πού	 είναι;	 Πού	 είναι	 ο	 φίλος	 σου;	 Because	 this,	 ο	
    φίλος	 σου,	 is	 like	 extra	 information,	 let’s	 say.	 If	 we	 knew	 who	 we	 were	 talking	
    about,	we	would	just	say,	Πού	είναι;	and	that	makes	it	very	flexible.	O	φίλος	σου	
    πού	 είναι;	 Πού	 είναι	 ο	 φίλος	 σου;	 Is	 your	 friend	 (female	 friend)	 …	 is	 your	 friend	
    bringing	it?	Is	your	friend	bringing	it?	Female	friend.		
		
S:	 Bring	…	?		
		
T:	 So	think	of	…	what	did	we	think	of	to	…	?		
		
S:	 Περιφέρνω?		
		
T:	 Φέρνω	[férno].		
		
S:	 Φέρνω.		
		
T:	 Φέρνω.	So,	Is	your	female	friend	bringing	it?		
		
S:	 Η	φίλη	σου	το	φέρνει;	[i	fíli	su	to	férni?].		


                                                                                                 93
		
T:	 Good.	Η	φίλη	σου	το	φέρνει;	Το	φέρνει	η	φίλη	σου;	[to	férni	i	fíli	su?].	Again,	we	
    can	have	that	flexibility.	How	would	you	say,	Isn’t	your	friend	bringing	it?		
		
S:	 Δεν	το	φέρνει	η	φίλη	σου;	[dhen	to	férni	i	fíli	su?].		
		
T:	 Good.	 Δεν	 το	 φέρνει	 η	 φίλη	 σου;	 Η	 φίλη	 σου	 δεν	 το	 φέρνει;	 [i	 fíli	 su	 dhen	 to

S:	 Η	φίλη	σου	δεν	το	φέρνει;		
		
T:	 Very	good.	So	we	have	that	structure,	δεν	το	φέρνει,	which	is	quite	a	rigid	order,	
    but	then	that	extra	information	is	very	flexible.	Δεν	το	φέρνει	η	φίλη	σου;	Η	φίλη

Teacher:	“I	learn”,	in	Greek,	is	μαθαίνω	[mathéno].	Μαθαίνω.		
	
Student:	Μαθαίνω.		
	
T:	 And	 this	 is	 of	 course	 where	 mathematics	 comes	 from.	 They	 are	 sharing	 a	 root,	
    these	 two	 words,	 mathematics	 and	 μαθαίνω,	 I	 learn,	 in	 Greek.	 How	 would	 you	
    say,	He	learns/she	learns/it	learns?		
	
S:	 Μαθαίνει	[mathéni].		
	
T:	 Μαθαίνει.	Good.	“The	child”,	in	Greek,	is,	το	παιδί	[to	pedhí].	Το	παιδί.		
	
S:	 Το	παιδί.		
	
T:	 So	first	…	the	first	interesting	thing	here	is	that	it’s	neuter,	no?	The	child	in	Greek	
    is	neuter.	It	doesn’t	have	a	gender	yet,	no?	It’s	not	masculine,	it’s	not	feminine,	
    it’s	a	child.	Το	παιδί.		
	
S:	 Το	παιδί.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	The	child	learns?		
	
S:	 Το	παιδί	μαθαίνει	[to	pedhí	mathéni].		
	
T:	 Το	 παιδί	μαθαίνει.	So	 the	 child	 is	 like	he,	 she,	 or	 it,	 no?	We	are	using	 μαθαίνει.	
    And	 we	 can	 also	 connect	 παιδί	 to	 something	 in	 English.	 In	 English	 we	 have	
    pedagogy,	no?	Pedagogical,	which	is	about	learning,	so	we	have	the	relationship	
    there	between	children	and	learning;	pediatrician,	a	child	doctor.	So	μαθαίνω	is,	I	
    learn.	“Course”,	like	a	course	or	a	class	is,	μάθημα	[máthima].	Μάθημα.		
	
S:	 Μάθημα.		
	
T:	 Good.	What	gender	does	it	look	like?		
	
S:	 Το	μάθημα	[to	máthima].		
	
T:	 Yeah,	neuter.		
	
S:	 Neutral	(?).		
	
T:	 Το	μάθημα.	Good.	So	it	could	have	been	feminine.	It	ends	in	an	A	like	απολογία,	
    apology.	 But	 MA	 (μα)	 shows	 us	 that	 it	 is	 neuter,	 like	 πρόβλημα	 [próvlima],	
    πρόγραμμα	 [prógrama].	 So	 the	 word	 for	 class	 or	 course	 is	 literally	 like	 “math”,	
    with	[ma],	μάθημα.	Μάθημα.	The	course,	the	class?		
	


                                                                                             95
S:	 Το	μάθημα.		
	
T:	 Το	μάθημα.	“I	start”	in	Greek,	I	start,	is	αρχίζω	[archízo].	Αρχίζω.		
	
S:	 Αρχίζω.		
	
T:	 Good.	And	this	[ch]	sound	that	we	have	there,	is	written	with	that	X	(χ).	It	looks	
    like	an	X;	the	bottom	part	of	the	X	is	much	longer	and	it	goes	below	the	line,	but	it	
    looks	like	an	X.	Αρχίζω.		
	
S:	 Αρχίζω.		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 you	 could	 say,	 The	 course	 starts	 tomorrow.	 What	 was	 the	 word	 for	
    tomorrow?	
	
S:	 Αύριο	[ávrio].		
	
T:	 Αύριο.	Good.	So	how	would	you	say	that,	The	course	starts	tomorrow?	
	
S:	 Το	μάθημα	αρχίζει	αύριο	[to	máthima	archízi	ávrio].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Το	 μάθημα	 αρχίζει	 αύριο.	 And	 the	 verb,	 start,	 αρχίζει,	 no?	 It’s	
    changing	 for,	 το	 μάθημα,	 no?	 Which	 is	 like	 it.	 Which	 makes	 το	 μάθημα	 much	
    more	 flexible	 in	 Greek	 than	 it	 is	 in	 English,	 for	 example.	 In	 English,	 it’s	 generally	
    the	word	order	showing	us	who	is	doing	what	and	what’s	going	on,	but	we	don’t	
    need	that	in	Greek.	We	have	αρχίζει	showing	us.	So	you	could	move	that,	so	give	
    me	the	same	sentence,	The	course	starts	tomorrow.	But	let’s	play	around	a	little	
    bit	with	the	order.	Let’s	start	with	tomorrow,	for	example.		
	
S:	 Αύριο	αρχίζει	το	μάθημα	[ávrio	archízi	to	máthima].		
	
T:	 Αύριο	αρχίζει	το	μάθημα.	That’s	a	possible	order	in	Greek.	You	could	mix	it	up	a	
    little	bit	more:	you	could	start	with	the	verb.		
	
S:	 Αρχίζει	το	μάθημα	αύριο	[archízi	to	máthima	ávrio].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Αρχίζει	 το	 μάθημα	 αύριο.	 So	 you	 have	 this	 very	 flexible	 word	 order	 in	
    Greek,	 and	 you	 can	 use	 it	 to	 stress	 different	 things.	 And	 rather	 than	 looking	 at	
    rules	about	what	stresses	what,	you	should	just	listen	out	for	it,	because	in	a	real	
    life	 context,	 that	 emphasis	 that	 is	 achieved	 in	 the	 language	 is	 also	 going	 to	 be	
    accompanied	by	hand	expressions,	and	facial	expressions,	and	a	context	that	will	
    really	help	you	interiorise	it.	How	would	you	say,	I	have	class?		
	
S:	 Έχω	μάθημα	[ékho	máthima].		
	
T:	 Έχω	μάθημα.	Good.	So	here	we	have	the	[kh]	a	little	bit	more	harsh,	έχω	[ékho],	
    because	it	is	followed	by	an	O.	Έχω	μάθημα.	But	we	mentioned	briefly	that	if	we	


                                                                                                    96
   are	following	that	with	an	[e]	or	[i]	sound,	it’s	going	to	sound	softer,	this	[ch]	that	
   you	write	like	X.	How	would	you	say,	She	has	class?		
	
S:	 Έχει	μάθημα	[échi	máthima].		
	
T:	 Good.	 There	 it’s	 softer	 again,	 because	 it’s	 followed	 by	 that	 [i]	 sound.	 Έχει.	 Έχει	
    μάθημα.	The	word	for	“there	is”	in	Greek,	there	is,	is	υπάρχει	[ipárchi].	Υπάρχει.		
	
S:	 Υπάρχει.		
	
T:	 Υπάρχει,	there	is.	So	this	is	what	we	use	for	there	is	in	Greek,	but	actually	this	verb	
    we	 will	 translate	 as	 “exists”,	 “it	 exists”.	 What	 we’re	 actually	 saying	 there	 is,	 “it	
    exists”,	for	“there	is”.	Now,	υπάρχει,	there	is,	is	actually	built	of	υπο	[ipo],	no?	We	
    have	 this	 in	 English	 like	 hypo,	 hypoglycemic	 –	 low	 blood	 sugar.	 Hypoglycemia.	
    Αίμα	[ema],	αίμα	in	Greek	is	“blood”,	neuter,	no?	Ending	MA,	το	αίμα,	the	blood.	
    So	 in	 υπάρχει	 we	 have	 υπο	 [ipo]	 like	 in	 hypoglycemia,	 and	 αρχή	 [archí],	 the	
    beginning,	the	start.	So	υπο	means	something	like	“below”,	similar	in	meaning	to	
    this	 κατε/κατα	 [kate/kata]	 that	 we	 saw	 –	 below.	 And	 αρχή	 is	 the	 “beginning”,	 η	
    aρχή,	 the	 beginning,	 the	 start.	 So	 υπάρχει	 –	 you	 can	 see	 it	 got	 a	 little	 bit	
    contracted	 and	 crushed	 together	 there	 –	 υπάρχει	 is	 something	 like,	 below	 the	
    start,	meaning	“there	is”,	or	“exists”.	Very	odd,	no?		
	
S:	 Yeah.		
	
T:	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 There	 is	 a	 problem?	 There	 is	 problem	 –	 we	 don’t	 need	 the	
    word	for	“a”	there.	We	could	just	say,	There	is	problem.		
	
S:	 Υπάρχει	πρόβλημα	[ipárchi	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Υπάρχει	 πρόβλημα.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 There’s	 no	 problem?	 There	 isn’t	 a	
    problem.		
	
S:	 Δεν	υπάρχει	πρόβλημα	[dhen	ipárchi	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 υπάρχει	 πρόβλημα.	 So,	 υπάρχει	 is	 built	 of	 υπο	 [ipo]	 and	 αρχή	
    [archí],	 below	 start,	 meaning	 “to	 exist”,	 interestingly	 or	 mind-blowingly.	 And	 we	
    also	saw	that	we	have	the	verb,	αρχίζω	[archízo],	I	start.	We	also	have,	using	this	
    υπο,	 υπομονή	 [ipomoní],	 υπομονή.	 Υπο	 [ipo]	 means	 below,	 no?	 And	 μονή	 is	
    actually	coming	from	μένω	[méno],	and	this	means	“patience”.	To	below-stay,	no?	
    “Patience”.	So	tell	me	again,	There	is	a	problem.		
	
S:	 Υπάρχει	πρόβλημα	[ipárchi	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Υπάρχει	πρόβλημα.	There	is	problem.	We	don’t	need	the	word	for	“a”	there.	But	
    you	 can	 use	 the	 word	 for	 “a”	 if	 you	 want.	 A	 problem	 is,	 ένα	 πρόβλημα	 [éna	
    próvlima].	So	how	would	that	be?		
	


                                                                                                  97
S:	 Υπάρχει	ένα	πρόβλημα	[ipárchi	éna	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Υπάρχει	 ένα	 πρόβλημα.	 So,	 ένα	 is	 the	 word	 for	 “a”,	 for	 neuter	 nouns.	 So,	 you	
    remember	the	word	for,	house?		
	
S:	 Σπίτι	[spíti].		
	
T:	 Σπίτι.	Good.	A	house?		
	
S:	 Ένα	σπίτι	[éna	spíti].		
	
T:	 Ένα	σπίτι.	Yes.	Σπίτι	was	neuter	and	the	“i”	on	the	end	is	written	like	the	Latin	or	
    the	English	i	(ι)	that	we	have,	no?	Not	like	that	feminine	ending	(η),	no?	So	that’s	
    how	 we	 know	 it’s	 not	 feminine.	 Ένα	 σπίτι,	 a	 house.	 And	 what	 happens	 when	
    something	is	masculine?	What	happens	when	a	noun	or	an	adjective	is	masculine?	
    What	does	it	tend	to	have	on	the	end?		
	
S:	 An	S?		
	
T:	 An	S.	So	what	do	you	think	“ένα”	might	be	for	masculine	nouns?		
	
S:	 Ένας	[énas].		
	
T:	 Ένας.	Yes,	it	is.	You	remember	how	to	say	coffee	in	Greek?		
	
S:	 Καφέ	[kafé]?	
	
T:	 But	it’s	masculine.		
	
S:	 Καφές	[kafés]?		
	
T:	 Καφές,	good.	Καφές.	And	that	will	feel	a	bit	uncomfortable	with	us,	because	we	
    will	feel	like	it’s	a	plural,	no?	But	no,	this	is	just	a	masculine	ending	in	Greek.	So,	a	
    coffee,	is?		
	
S:	 Ένας	καφές	[énas	kafés].		
	
T:	 Ένας	καφές.	What	was	the	word	for	here?		
	
S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
	
T:	 Εδώ.	How	would	you	say,	Τhere	is	a	coffee	here?		
	
S:	 Υπάρχει	ένας	καφές	εδώ	[ipárchi	énas	kafés	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Υπάρχει	ένας	καφές	εδώ.	Very	good.	So	we	have,	υπάρχει	with	both	
    υπο	[ipo]	and	αρχή	[archí].	Something	like	below-start,	which	means	“there	is”,	or	


                                                                                           98
   “there	 exists”	 would	 be	 the	 more	 literal	 translation,	 no?	 Even	 there	 is	 a	 song	
   actually,	 a	 very	 famous	 song	 in	 Greek,	 υπάρχω	 [ipárcho].	 What	 does	 υπάρχω	
   mean?		
	
S:	 I	am	here?		
	
T:	 Well	literally,	“I	exist”,	but	actually	in	this	song	it’s	used	a	little	bit	like,	I	am	here	
    or	there,	I	am	present,	no?	The	lyrics	are	something	like,	I	am	always	present	by	
    you	in	your	eyes	when	they	cry,	or	something	like	this.	It’s	a	love	song.	You	can	
    listen	to	it	to	practice	your	Greek.	Υπάρχω.

S:	 Η	μέρα	[i	méra].		
	
T:	 Η	μέρα,	no?	Καλημέρα,	η	μέρα.	Good.	What	was	the	word	for,	here?		
	
S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
	
T:	 Εδώ.	The	word	for	“there”.	The	word	for	“there”	was	εκεί	[ekí].	Εκεί.		
	
S:	 Εκεί.		
	
T:	 So	we	have	εδώ	and	εκεί.	If	you	want	to	say	“that	day”,	you	will	say	εκείνη	η	μέρα	
    [ekíni	i	méra].	So	we	saw	when	we	say	“this	problem”,	for	example,	we	say	“this	
    the	 problem”;	 in	 the	 same	 way,	 we’re	 going	 to	 say	 “that	 the	 problem”.	 So,	 that	
    day,	εκείνη	η	μέρα.	How	would	you	say,	that	road?	What	was	the	word	for	road?		
	
S:	 Δρόμος.	Εκείνος	ο	δρόμος	[ekínos	o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Bravo,	 very	 good.	 Εκείνος	 ο	 δρόμος.	 So	 now,	 with	 what	 you	 know	 about	 Greek,	
    you	 could	 find	 just	 one	 version	 of	 εκείνος;	 we	 saw	 εκείνη	 [ekíni],	 and	 you	 know	
    what	to	do	with	it.	Εκείνη,	εκείνος,	εκείνο	[ekíno].	A	way	to	refer	to	a	person	that	
    is	quite	common	in	Greek	is,	άτομο	[átomo].	Άτομο.	What	does	άτομο	mean?		
	
S:	 Atom?		
	
T:	 Atom,	no?	That’s	very	interesting.	So	a	person	is	an	atom,	no?	And	it’s	true,	no?	
    We	are	just	each	individually	one	cell	of	the	big	picture,	and	that’s	reflected	there	
    in	Greek.	So	“a	person”,	ένα	άτομο.	What	gender	is	that,	ενα	άτομο?		
	
S:	 Mmm,	neutral.		
	
T:	 Neutral,	good,	neuter.	How	would	you	say,	that	person?		
	
S:	 Εκείνο	το	άτομο	[ekíno	to	átomo].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Εκείνο	 το	 άτομο.	 Very	 good.	 “Good	 evening”	 is	 καλό	 βράδυ	 [kaló	
    vrádhi]	with	δέλτα	(δ/Δ).	Βράδυ.		
	


                                                                                             100
S:	 Καλό	βράδυ.		
	
T:	 And	it’s	used	exclusively	for	goodbye,	rather	than	good	evening,	which	in	English	
    we	 use	 to	 say	 hello	 as	 well.	 So	 maybe	 it’s	 a	 little	 bit	 more	 like	 good	 night,	 but	
    βράδυ	means	evening.	What	gender	is	βράδυ,	if	we	say	καλό	βράδυ?		
	
S:	 Mmm.	Neutral?		
	
T:	 Neuter.	 Good.	 Καλό	 [kaló],	 we	 know	 there	 we	 have	 the	 neuter	 ending.	 So	 how	
    would	you	say,	that	evening?		
	
S:	 Εκείνο	το	βράδυ	[ekíno	to	vrádhi].		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 εκείνο	 το	 βράδυ.	 Good.	 So	 we’ve	 seen	 a	 little	 bit	 in	 Greek	 how	
    adjectives	 –	 describing	 words	 –	 change	 in	 their	 own	 way,	 no?	 We	 have,	 καλός	
    [kalós],	καλή	[kalí],	καλό	[kaló].	But	[kaló],	apart	from	an	adjective,	is	also	a	verb!	
    Now,	καλό	as	an	adjective	is	written	k-a-the	Greek	L,	which	we	will	talk	about,	and	
    o	–	an	“o”	like	the	English	O.	But	καλώ	[kaló]	as	a	verb,	how	would	it	have	to	be	
    written,	that	final	[o]	sound?		
	
S:	 Like	a	M.		
	
T:	 Like	an	upside-down	M,	yes.	Or	like	a	W.		
	
S:	 A	“W”,	okay.		
	
T:	 Καλώ	[kaló].	Good,	with	the	ωμέγα	[oméga]	(ω/Ω),	showing	you	that	it’s	a	verb	in	
    writing,	no?	So	we	have	καλό,	good,	or	καλός	or	καλή,	and	then	καλώ	as	a	verb	
    means	“I	invite”	or	“I	call”.	You	have	both	of	these	meanings.	So	καλώ	as	a	verb	
    means,	 I	 invite,	 or	 I	 call,	 and	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 end,	 no?	 Like	 μπορώ	
    [boró],	I	can,	προσπαθώ	[prospathó],	I	try.	How	would	you	say,	I’m	inviting	you?		
	
S:	 Σε	καλώ	[se	kaló].		
	
T:	 Σε	καλώ.	The	word	for	“him”	is	τον	[ton].	Τον.		
	
S:	 Τον.		
	
T:	 Τον.	That’s	spelt	with	a	T,	an	O,	and	how	do	we	get	that	N	sound?		
	
S:	 From	a	V.		
	
T:	 From	a	V,	good.	The	letter	looks	like	V	(τον).	So	that	means	him,	so	if	you	want	to	
    say,	I’m	inviting	him?		
	
S:	 Τον	καλώ	[ton	kaló].		
	


                                                                                                 101
T:	 Τον	καλώ.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	We’re	inviting	him?		
	
S:	 Τον	καλούμε	[ton	kalúme].		
	
T:	 Τον	καλούμε.	Τον	καλούμε.	We’re	inviting	him,	if	you	want	to	emphasise	the	we?		
	
S:	 Εμείς	τον	καλούμε	[emís	ton	kalúme].		
	
T:	 Good.	Εμείς	τον	καλούμε.	Good.	We,	we’re	inviting	him.	The	word	for	us,	so	we’ve	
    seen	the	word	for	we,	which	is	εμείς.	The	word	for	us	is	μας	[mas].	So	how	would	
    we	say,	He’s	inviting	us?		
	
S:	 Μας	καλεί	[mas	kalí].		
	
T:	 Good,	and	you’re	keeping	the	accent	on	the	end	there,	μας	καλεί.	Now	you	would	
    know	 that	 this	 is	 a	 verb	 in	 writing,	 because	 the	 [i]	 sound	 on	 the	 end	 there	 is	
    spelled	 EI	 (ει).	 We	 mentioned	 briefly	 that	 EI	 also	 gives	 us	 this	 [i]	 sound,	 and	 it’s	
    used	 with	 the	 verb	 ending	 for	 he,	 she,	 or	 it,	 no?	 Μας	 καλεί.	 How	 would	 you	
    emphasise	the	word	for	he?	He’s	inviting	us.		
	
S:	 Αυτός	μας	καλεί	[aftós	mas	kalí].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Αυτός	 μας	 καλεί.	 Good.	 You’re	 inviting	 us.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 You’re	
    inviting	us?		
	
S:	 Μας	καλείς	[mas	kalís].		
	
T:	 Μας	καλείς.		
	
S:	 Μας	καλείς.	
	
T:	 Aren’t	you	inviting	us?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μας	καλείς;	[dhen	mas	kalís?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 μας	 καλείς;	 Aren’t	 you	 inviting	 us?	 Good.	 Παρακαλώ	 [parakaló],	
    παρακαλώ	 means	 “I	 plead”	 or	 “request”,	 and	 actually	 it’s	 used	 like	 “please”	 in	
    Greek.	You	will	hear	this	a	lot:	παρακαλώ,	please.		
	
S:	 Παρακαλώ.		
	
T:	 So	παρα	[para],	we	also	have	in	English,	we	have	it	in	parasite,	paranormal,	…		
	
S:	 Paranoid.		
	
T:	 Paranoid	 is	 from	 νους	 [nus]	 (mind),	 or	 νους.	 Paranoia	 –	 beside	 or	 beyond	 the	
    mind.	 So	 παρα	 means	 something	 like	 beyond	 or	 alongside.	 So	 we	 have,	 καλώ,	 I	


                                                                                                  102
   invite,	or	I	call,	and	παρακαλώ,	beyond	or	alongside	that.	We	have	“I	plead”	used	
   like	 “please”,	 no?	 When	 we	 plead	 something,	 we	 are	 inviting	 somebody	 to	 do	
   something	for	us.	So	παρακαλώ	which	is	“plead”,	or	you	know,	“please”.	You	will	
   also	hear,	I	plead,	as	please	(παρακαλώ),	and	also,	I	plead	you,	as	please.	So	how	
   would	that	sound?	I	plead	you?		
	
S:	 Σε	παρακαλώ	[se	parakaló].		
	
T:	 Σε	παρακαλώ.	You	will	hear	that	as	well.	Παρα	[para],	we	can	put	with	our	verb	
    for	“I	stay”.	What	was,	I	stay?		
	
S:	 Μένω	[méno].		
	
T:	 Μένω.	And	how	will	it	sound	if	you	put	παρα	there	with	it?		
	
S:	 Παραμένω	[paraméno].		
	
T:	 Παραμένω.	Παραμένω	means	“I	remain”,	I	remain,	so	very	similar	in	meaning	to,	I	
    stay,	no?	Just	maybe	a	little	bit	more	insisting,	I	don’t	know.	Maybe	you	would	like	
    to	say,	We’re	staying	here,	like,	We’re	not	going	anywhere.	There	you	would	say,	
    We’re	remaining	here.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Παραμένω?	Παραμένουμε	εδώ	[paraménume	edhó].		
	
T:	 Παραμένουμε	εδώ.	We’re	remaining	here,	like,	we’re	staying	put.	We’re	not	going	
    anywhere.	Παραμένουμε	εδώ.	How	would	you	say,	We’re	remaining	there?		
	
S:	 Παραμένουμε	εκεί	[paraménume	ekí].

Teacher:	 Now	 we’re	 going	 to	 learn	 to	 talk	 about	 the	 future	 in	 Greek.	 The	 word	 for	
    “will”	in	Greek	like,	I	will	do	it,	I	will	wait,	is	θα	[tha].	Θα.		
	
Student:	Θα.		
	
T:	 Θα.	 Now	 θα	 is	 spelt	 with	 that	 letter	 that	 looks	 like	 a	 zero	 with	 a	 horizontal	 line	
    running	through	the	middle	(Θ/θ),	which	gives	us	TH	–	θα.	And	it	really	is	“will”.	It	
    literally	 is	 the	 very	 same	 word.	 “Will”	 in	 English	 is	 just	 the	 word	 for	 want	 in	
    German,	ich	will	[ich	vil],	which	in	German	is	spelt	“W-I-L-L”.	We	literally	in	English	
    just	took	the	German	word	for	want,	and	used	it	to	go	into	the	future.	And	Greek	
    does	 something	 very	 similar.	 Θα	 in	 Greek	 is	 a	 contraction	 of	 θέλει	 να	 [théli	 na].	
    Θέλει	 να	 has	 contracted	 to	 produce	 θα,	 so	 θέλει	 να,	 like	 “it	 wants”.	 We	 don’t	
    know	 who	 wants,	 the	 universe,	 or	 maybe	 there’s	 like	 almost	 a	 superstitious	
    feeling	there	of	talking	about	the	future.	The	Cypriot	version	–	there’s	a	different	
    version	in	Cyprus	of	this	θα	–	it’s	ένα	[éna].	Ένα.	And	this	is	also	a	contraction	of	
    θέλει	να,	just	a	different	contraction.	So	you	might	hear	that	if	you	go	to	Cyprus.	
    So,	if	you	say,	I	will	wait,	or	I	will	be	waiting,	you	will	use	this	θα,	and	then	you	will	
    say,	I	wait.	So	how	is	that?		
	
S:	 Θα	περιμένω	[tha	periméno].		
	
T:	 Θα	περιμένω.	I	will	wait,	or	I	will	be	waiting.	We	get	both	there.	I	will	wait	for	you,	
    or,	I’ll	be	waiting	for	you.	The	θα	will	go	first.		
	
S:	 Θα	σε	περιμένω	[tha	se	periméno].		
	
T:	 Θα	σε	περιμένω.	I	will	do	it,	or,	I	will	be	doing	it?	What	is,	I	do?		
	
S:	 Κάνω	[káno].		
	
T:	 Κάνω.	Good.	So	the	θα	again	is	going	to	come	first,	no?	I	will	do	it,	I	will	be	doing	
    it.		
	
S:	 Θα	το	κάνω	[tha	to	káno].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	κάνω.	Good.	You	remember	the	word	for	“after”,	or	“later”,	used	like	later?	
    We	 have	 it	 in	 “metaphysics”,	 which	 is	 something	 like	 beyond	 or	 after	 physics;	
    “metamorphosis”,	which	means	the	after-form.		
	
S:	 Μετα	[meta].		
	
T:	 Μετά	[metá],	μετά.		
	
S:	 Μετά.		
	


                                                                                                 104
T:	 So,	I	will	do	it	later,	I	will	do	it	after?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	κάνω	μετά	[tha	to	káno	metá].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	το	κάνω	μετά.	And	you	remember	the	word	for	“tomorrow”?		
	
S:	 Αύριο	[ávrio].		
	
T:	 Αύριο.	 This	 [av]	 is	 spelt	 AU	 (αυ).	 We’ve	 seen	 AU	 can	 make	 an	 [af]	 sound	 like	 in	
    αυτό,	 αυτός,	 αυτή	 [aftó,	 aftós,	 aftí],	 or	 an	 A-V	 [av]	 sound	 like	 in	 αύριο	 [ávrio].	
    Much	 more	 common	 though	 is	 [af].	 The	 [av]	 situation	 occurs	 much	 less.	 So	 AU	
    gives	us	[af]	or	[av].	And	the	same	with	EU.	EU	(ευ/ΕΥ)	will	give	us	[ef]	or	[ev].	So	
    for	example,	the	word	“euphoria”;	we	know	this	is	Greek	because	we	have	an	“f”	
    spelt	with	a	PH,	no?	Euphoria.	This	in	Greek	is,	ευφορία	[ef-foría].	Ευφορία.	This	
    EU	 (ευ),	 this	 [ef],	 means	 good	 or	 well,	 and	 then	 “phoria”	 actually	 means	 φέρνω	
    again:	bringing,	good	bringing,	like	in	periphery.	Eυφορία.	What	gender	is	it	if	you	
    had	to	guess?		
	
S:	 Ah,	feminine.		
	
T:	 Feminine,	 good.	 The	 euphoria	 –	 η	 ευφορία	 [i	 ef-foría].	 Ευχαριστώ	 [efkharistó],	
    ευχαριστώ,	in	Greek	means	“I	thank”	or	“thank	you”,	used	like,	thank	you.		
	
S:	 Ευχαριστώ.		
	
T:	 Ευχαριστώ.	And	it	means	something	like	“I	good	happy”.	This	[ef]	at	the	beginning	
    of	words,	most	of	the	time	it’s	something	like	good,	no?	And	χαρά	[khará]	means	
    happiness,	or	joy,	or	wellness.	So	we	are	saying	something	like,	I	good	joy	you,	I	
    good	wellness	you,	when	we	say	“thank	you”.	Ευχαριστώ.	How	would	you	say,	We	
    thank?		
	
S:	 Ευχαριστούμε	[efkharistúme].		
	
T:	 Ευχαριστούμε.	And	you	use	this	quite	a	lot	in	Greek.	If	you	say	thank	you	in	a	shop	
    and	you	are	accompanied,	it’s	very	common	to	say	ευχαριστούμε,	or	especially	if	
    you	are	at	a	restaruant	or	a	café,	or	something	like	this,	you	will	thank	on	behalf	
    of	 the	 people	 you	 are	 with.	 Ευχαριστώ,	 I	 thank;	 ευχαριστούμε,	 we	 thank.	 So	 in	
    ευχαριστώ	we	have	EU	(ευ)	pronounced	[ef]	as	in	ευφορία,	euphoria.	To	see	an	
    example	 of	 it	 pronounced	 like	 a	 V	 –	 we	 said	 this	 is	 less	 common,	 but	 it	 still	
    happens	–	we	have	Europe,	Ευρώπη	[evrópi].	Ευρώπη.		
	
S:	 Ευρώπη.		
	
T:	 Good.	So	you	will	notice	your	own	patterns	to	understand	how	it’s	pronounced.	
    We	 see	 both	 in	 αύριο	 [ávrio]	 and	 Ευρώπη	 [evrópi],	 that	 the	 R	 is	 creating	 the	 V	
    sound,	as	opposed	to	the	F	sound.	So	you	should	look	out	for	your	own	patterns,	
    but	generally	it’s	[ef]	or	[af],	but	it	could	be	[ev]	or	[av].	So	we	said	that	ευχαριστώ	


                                                                                                105
   was	built	of	good	and	joy.	And,	μία	χαρά	[mía	khará],	μία	χαρά	–	“a	joy”,	a	joy	–	is	
   a	 very	 common	 response	 to,	 τι	 κάνεις;	 [ti	 kánis?].	 How	 are	 you?	 Τι	 κάνεις;	 Πώς	
   είσει;	[pos	íse?].	Μία	χαρά	–	a	joy.	So	there	we	get	the	feminine	word	for	“a”	as	
   well,	μία	[mía].		
	
S:	 Μία	[mía].		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	a	day?	...	What	was,	good	day?		
	
S:	 Mία	μέρα	[mía	méra].		
	
T:	 Mία	μέρα.	Good.	Mία	μέρα.	A	day.	Αn	apology?	Αn	apology?		
	
S:	 Mία	απολογία	[mía	apología].		
	
T:	 Mία	απολογία	[mía	apoloyía],	pronounced	like	a	Y.	Απολογία.		
	
S:	 Απολογία.		
	
T:	 Good.	 And	 we	 also	 saw	 the	 word	 for	 “a”	 for	 neuter	 words,	 no?	 How	 was,	 a	
    problem?		
	
S:	 Ένα	πρόβλημα	[éna	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Ένα	πρόβλημα.	A	house?		
	
S:	 Ένα	σπίτι	[spíti].		
	
T:	 Ένα	σπίτι.	And	for	masculine,	what	did	we	have	instead	of	ένα,	for	masculine?		
	
S:	 Ένας	[énas].		
	
T:	 Ένας,	ένας,	good.	So,	a	road.	How	would	you	say	that,	a	road?		
	
S:	 Ένας	δρόμος	[énas	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Or,	a	coffee.		
	
S:	 Ένας	καφές	[énas	kafés].		
	
T:	 Ένας	 καφές.	 So	 for	 “a”,	 we	 have	 ένα	 [éna]	 and	 ένας	 [énas],	 and	 then	 μία	 [mía],	
    looking	very	different	to	the	other	ones.

Teacher:	 How	 was	 the	 word	 for	 “will”	 in	 Greek,	 which	 is	 actually	 a	 contraction	 of,	
    θέλει	να	[théli	na]?		
	
Student:	Θα	[tha].		
	
T:	 Θα.	 Very	 good.	 So	 if	 you	 say,	 for	 example,	 We	 will	 do	 it	 tomorrow,	 or	 We’ll	 be	
    doing	it	tomorrow,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	κάνουμε	αύριο	[tha	to	kánume	ávrio].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	το	κάνουμε	αύριο.	We	won’t	be	doing	it	tomorrow?	The	negation	(the	
    δεν)	[dhen]	is	going	to	come	first.	We	won’t	be	doing	it	tomorrow.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	το	κάνουμε	αύριο	[dhen	tha	to	kánume	ávrio].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θα	το	κάνουμε	αύριο.	So	we	get	through	quite	a	lot	of	information	
    there,	before	we	get	to	the	verb,	no?	Δεν,	θα,	το	…	we	don’t	know	what’s	going	
    on	until	we	get	to	the	verb.	Δεν	θα	το	κάνουμε	αύριο.	(We	won’t	do	it	tomorrow.	
    We	won’t	be	doing	it	tomorrow.)		
	
	 So	we’ve	been	translating	the	future,	like,	θα	κάνω	[tha	káno],	for	example,	as	I	
    will	do,	or	I	will	be	doing.	I’ve	been	giving	both	of	those	translations.	Now,	in	fact,	
    in	 Greek,	 we	 have	 two	 different	 verb	 forms	 to	 show	 which	 one	 we	 mean	 –	
    whether	we	want	to	say,	I	will	do,	or	I	will	be	doing.	But	most	of	the	time	we	have	
    two	different	verb	forms	to	make	that	difference	clear.	But	κάνω	is	an	exception.	
    So,	 θα	 κάνω	 can	 mean,	 I	 will	 do,	 or	 I	 will	 be	 doing.	 The	 same	 with	 περιμένω	
    [periméno]		–	θα	περιμένω	[tha	periméno],	for	example,	could	mean,	I	will	wait,	
    or	 I	 will	 be	 waiting.	 But	 otherwise,	 we	 have	 a	 way	 to	 show	 this	 difference	 in	
    Greek.	With	the	great	majority	of	verbs,	we	have	an	alternative	verb	form	to	use,	
    to	show	that	we	mean,	I	will	do	it,	rather	than,	I	will	be	doing	it;	I	will	write,	rather	
    than,	I	will	be	writing.		
	
	 “Photography”	is	not	a	Greek	word,	but	it’s	built	of	Greek	parts.	It	was	coined	by	
    an	Englishman,	I	believe	–	photography	is	not	a	Greek	thing,	but	it’s	been	built	of	
    Greek	 parts,	 this	 word.	 We	 have	 the	 PH,	 giving	 us	 [f],	 letting	 us	 into	 that.	 So	
    photography	means	“writing	with	light”.	I	write,	in	Greek	is,	γράφω	[ghráfo],	and	
    we	 have	 the	 [gh]	 G,	 like	 in	 εγώ	 [eghó],	 the	 word	 for	 “I”.	 Γράφω	 [ghráfo],	 εγώ	
    γράφω.		
	
S:	 Γράφω.		
	
T:	 Θα	γράφω	[tha	ghráfo]	means,	I	will	be	writing	–	only,	I	will	be	writing,	not	I	will	
    write.	 See,	 if	 we	 use	 the	 standard	 form	 of	 the	 verb	 with	 θα,	 we	 get,	 I	 will	 be	
    writing.	So,	like	for	example,	if	I	said	to	you,	What	will	you	do	when	you	graduate?	
    Θα	 γράφω	 [tha	 ghráfo]	 –	 I	 will	 be	 writing.	 So	 we’re	 not	 looking	 for	 exact	


                                                                                               107
   translations,	no,	between	English	and	Greek,	because	in	English,	it’s	quite	strange	
   to	say,	I	will	be	writing,	in	this	context.		
	
	 In	Greek,	what	we	want	to	look	at	is,	do	we	refer	to	an	ongoing	period	of	time,	or	
    do	we	refer	to	a	closed	period	of	time?	What	will	you	do	when	you	graduate?	–	I	
    will	write.	This	is	ongoing	–	I	will	be	writing	–	even	though	that’s	an	odd	thing	to	
    say	 in	 English.	 So,	 we’ll	 say,	 Θα	 γράφω	 [tha	 ghráfo]	 in	 Greek	 –	 something	 like,	 I	
    will	 be	 writing.	 Now,	 if	 we	 want	 to	 say,	 I	 will	 write	 it,	 we	 are	 referring	 to	
    something	 specific	 and	 closed	 in	 time,	 then	 we	 will	 need	 to	 use	 our	 alternative	
    form	of	the	verb.	So	other	than	γράφω	[ghráfo],	we	have	also,	γράψω	[ghrápso].		
	
S:	 Γράψω.		
	
T:	 Γράψω.	So	we	have	γράφω	and	γράψω.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	for	example,	I	will	
    write	it,	we	have	a	closed	period	of	time	referring	to	that	“it”,	so	we	will	use	our	
    alternative	form	of	the	verb	to	show	that.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	γράψω	[tha	to	grápso].		
	
T:	 And	more	like	[gh],	like	in	εγώ	[eghó],	θα	το	γράψω	[tha	to	ghrápso].	How	would	
    you	say,	He	will	write	it?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	γράψει	[tha	to	ghrápsi].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	γράψει.	But,	if	somebody	says	to	you,	What	will	he	do	once	he	graduates?	
    and	you	will	say,	He	will	write,	then	what	you	want	is	something	like,	He	will	be	
    writing.	 So	 you	 won’t	 change	 to	 the	 alternative	 form;	 we	 will	 stay	 with	 our	
    standard	form	of	the	verb.	So,	He	will	be	writing?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	γράφει	[tha	to	ghráfi].		
	
T:	 Well	you	said	“το”	there;	you	said	“it”.	And	“το”	gives	us	a	feeling	of	something	
    actually	quite	closed,	and	is	quite	specific,	so	there	it	would	fit	better,	γράψει:	θα	
    το	γράψει	[tha	to	ghrápsi].	But	that’s	not	a	hard	and	fast	rule;	it	all	just	depends	
    on	the	context.	If	we	were	to	say	something	like,	He	will	write	it	every	morning,	
    there	we	would	be	referring	to	an	open,	ongoing	period	of	time,	so	we	would	stay	
    with	 our	 standard	 verb	 form,	 γράφει	 [ghráfi].	 So	 we	 can	 use	 this	 alternative	
    version,	γράψω	[ghrápso],	only	in	some	situations,	like	after	θα	[tha].	We	already	
    saw	 that	 γράφω	 [ghráfo]	 without	 a	 θα	 [tha]	 –	 or	 something	 else	 that	 makes	 us	
    have	to	choose	beween	γράφω	[ghráfo]	and	γράψω	[ghrápso]	–	γράφω	means,	I	
    write,	or	I’m	writing	–	το	γράφω	[to	ghráfo],	I	write	it,	I’m	writing	it.		
	
	 Only	in	some	structural	situations	we	have	to	think	about,	do	we	mean	an	open,	
    ongoing	period	of	time,	or	a	closed	one.	But	only	in	some	situations,	not	all	 the	
    time	in	the	language.	So,	after	θα	[tha],	we	have	to	think	about	whether	we	want	
    γράφω	 [ghráfo]	 or	 γράψω	 [ghrápso],	 looking	 at	 the	 context.	 Also,	 after	 να	 [na].	
    We’ve	seen	already	that	θα	[tha]	is	just	a	contraction	of	θέλει	να	[théli	na].	So,	if	


                                                                                                108
  you	say,	for	example,	I	want	to	write,	you	have	your	να	[na]	there,	which	means	
  you’re	going	to	have	to	think	about	what	you	mean.	So	let’s	imagine	we	want	to	
  say,	I	want	to	write,	and	we	mean	in	life,	generally,	like,	I	want	to	be	a	writer.	Is	
  this	an	open,	ongoing	time,	or	is	this	a	closed	time?	I	want	to	write,	in	the	sense	
  of,	I	want	to	be	a	writer.		
	
S:	 Open.		
	
T:	 Open,	ongoing.	I	want	to	be	a	writer,	no?	So	what	form	of	the	verb	do	you	use?		
	
S:	 Γράφω	[ghráfo].		
	
T:	 Γράφω,	our	normal,	standard	version	of	the	verb.	So	how	would	that	be,	I	want	to	
    write,	in	this	context?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	γράφω	[thélo	na	ghráfo].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	γράφω.	Good.	But	if	you	say,	for	example,	I	want	to	write	tomorrow	–	is	
    this	an	open	period	of	time	or	a	closed	period	of	time?		
	
S:	 Closed.		
	
T:	 It’s	closed	now,	in	which	case	you’ll	have	to	use,	γράψω	[ghrápso]	to	show	that.	
    So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	γράψω	αύριο	[thélo	na	ghrápso	ávrio].		
	
T:	 Good,	θέλω	να	γράψω	αύριο.	If	you	said,	I	want	to	write	it	–	that	by	itself	(I	want	
    to	write	it),	without	any	other	context,	does	it	sound	like	an	open,	ongoing	period	
    of	time,	or	a	closed	one?	I	want	to	write	it.		
	
S:	 Closed.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	that	be,	I	want	to	write	it?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	το	γράψω	[thélo	to	ghrápso].		
	
T:	 Slower,	slower.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	το	γράψω	[thélo	na	to	ghrápso].		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 θέλω	 να	 το	 γράψω.	 Good.	 We’ve	 encountered	 ύπο	 [ípo]	 meaning	
    something	 like	 below	 or	 under:	 hypoglycemia	 (low	 blood	 sugar),	 hypothermia	
    (low	 body	 temperature).	 Υπογράφω	 [ipoghráfo],	 υπογράφω,	 what	 do	 you	 think	
    that	might	mean,	υπογράφω?	I	under	write.		
	
S:	 Sign.		


                                                                                   109
	
T:	 Good.	Υπογράφω,	I	under	write,	I	sign.	Υπογράφω,	I	sign.	Now,	if	you	want	to	say,	
    I	will	sign	it,	is	this	an	open	period	of	time,	or	a	closed	one?		
	
S:	 Closed.		
	
T:	 So	 what	 might	 υπογράφω	 [ipoghráfo]	 change	 to?	 If	 γράφω	 [ghráfo]	 becomes	
    γράψω	[ghrápso],	υπογράφω	…	?		
	
S:	 Υπογράψω	[ipoghrápso].		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	I	will	sign	it?		
	
S:	 Θα	υπογράψω	…	θα	το	υπογράψω	[tha	to	ipoghrápso].		
	
T:	 Θα	 το	 υπογράψω,	 good.	 But	 imagine	 a	 context,	 it’s	 all	 about	 context,	 no?	 If	 we	
    want	to	say,	for	example,	I	will	be	signing,	like	it	will	be	my	job,	I	will	be	the	one	
    that’s	 responsible	 for	 signing	 all	 of	 the	 documents	 that	 will	 be	 coming	 –	 well,	 is	
    this	an	open	or	a	closed	period?		
	
S:	 Open.		
	
T:	 It’s	an	open	one,	no?	So,	I	will	be	signing?		
	
S:	 Θα	γράφω	…	θα	υπογράφω	[tha	ipoghráfo].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	θα	υπογράφω.	So	we’re	not	really	looking	for	direct	translations	of,	I	
    will	 write,	 I	 will	 be	 writing.	 The	 question	 we	 want	 to	 ask	 ourselves	 is,	 if	 we’re	
    referring	to	something	that	feels	like	an	open	period	of	time,	or	a	closed	period	of	
    time.	 And	 that	 distinction,	 that	 difference	 between	 the	 two,	 is	 going	 to	 become	
    much	clearer	as	we	continue	to	analyse	and	use	Greek.		
	
	 And	also,	it’s	worth	mentioning	again	that	this	doesn’t	happen	with	every	single	
    verb.	 There	 are	 an	 important	 group	 of	 quite	 common	 verbs	 that	 don’t	 have	
    alternative	forms	–	the	ones	we’ve	been	using	in	this	kind	of	sentence	structure	
    until	 now.	 So,	 έχω	 [ékho],	 ξέρω	 [kséro],	 περιμένω	 [periméno],	 κάνω	 [káno]	 –	
    these	 verbs	 don’t	 have	 an	 alternative	 form.	 They	 don’t	 change.	 But	 the	 great	
    majority	of	verbs	in	Greek	do	have	an	alternative	form.

Teacher:	If	we	say,	I	want	to	write	well,	I	want	to	write	well,	what	do	we	mean?	What	
    do	we	refer	to?	Do	we	refer	to	an	open,	extended	period	of	time,	or	do	we	refer	
    to	a	closed	period	of	time?	I	want	to	write	well.		
	
Student:	Open?		
	
T:	 Open.	 I	 want	 to	 write	 well.	 That	 sounds	 like	 generally,	 in	 life,	 no?	 The	 word	 for	
    “well”	is	καλά	[kalá].		
	
S:	 Καλά.		
	
T:	 Καλά,	 obviously	 related	 to	 good,	 no:	 καλός/καλή/καλό	 [kalós/kalí/kaló],	 and	 we	
    can	 feel	 that	 in	 English,	 as	 well.	 Sometimes,	 when	 somebody	 asks	 us	 in	 English,	
    how	are	we,	we	can	reply,	I’m	well,	or	we	can	reply,	I’m	good,	in	more	colloquial	
    English.	So,	of	course	those	words	are	connected.	I	want	to	write	well.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	γράφω	καλά	[thélo	na	ghráfo	kalá].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 So	 we’re	 using	 γράφω	 [ghráfo];	 we’re	 using	 our	 standard,	 ordinary	
    version	of	the	verb,	which	gives	us	an	open	feeling	of	time.	I	want	to	write	well,	
    θέλω	 να	 γράφω	 καλά.	 If	 you	 say,	 I	 want	 to	 write	 it	 well,	 I	 want	 to	 write	 it	 well,	
    does	anything	change?	Is	it	still	an	open	period	of	time?		
	
S:	 No,	“it”.		
	
T:	 Exactly.	 I	 want	 to	 write	 it	 well,	 we’re	 referring	 to	 something	 specific,	 so	 that’s	 a	
    closed	period	of	time:	I	want	to	write	it	well.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	το	γράψω	καλά	[thélo	na	to	ghrápso	kalá].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	το	γράψω	καλά.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	I	want	you	to	write	it	well?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	το	γράψεις	καλά	[thélo	na	to	grápsis	kalá].		
	
T:	 And	 again	 we	 want	 more	 of	 a	 [gh]	 sound	 then	 –	 [gh],	 no?	 Θέλω	 να	 το	 γράψεις	
    καλά	[thélo	na	to	ghrápsis	kalá].	Do	you	remember	the	word	for,	book?		
	
S:	 Βιβλίο	[vivlío].		
	
T:	 Βιβλίο.	And	how	would	a	book	be?		
	
S:	 Ένα	βιβλίο	[éna	vivlío].		
	
T:	 Ένα	βιβλίο.	How	would	you	say,	I	want	to	write	a	book?		
	


                                                                                                  111
S:	 Θέλω	να	γράψω	ένα	βιβλίο	[thélo	na	ghrápso	éna	vivlío].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θέλω	 να	 γράψω	 ένα	 βιβλίο.	 So	 the	 first	 thing	 you	 asked	 yourself,	 is	
    this	open	or	closed,	to	write	a	book?	Closed.	Θέλω	να	γράψω	ένα	βιβλίο.	“Books”	
    is	βιβλία	[vivlía],	the	plural	–	βιβλία,	books.		
	
S:	 Bιβλία.		
	
T:	 I	 want	 to	 write	 books,	 and	 you	 mean,	 I	 want	 to	 be	 a	 book-writer;	 I	 want	 to	 be	
    somebody	that	writes	books.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	γράφω	βιβλία	[thélo	na	ghráfo	vivlía].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	γράφω	βιβλία.	And	with	that,	γράφω	[ghráfo],	with	that	open,	ongoing	
    feeling,	we	understand,	I	want	to	be	somebody	that	writes	books,	I	want	to	be	a	
    book-writer.	The	word	for	“two”,	like	the	number	2	in	Greek,	is	δύο	[dhío].	Δύο.		
	
S:	 Δύο.		
	
T:	 This	 is	 δέλτα	 [dhélta]	 (Δ/δ),	 which	 looks	 like	 a	 “d”,	 or	 a	 triangle	 in	 capitals,	 “u”,	
    and	 then	 “o”.	 So	 the	 U	 in	 Greek,	 when	 it’s	 not	 in	 combination,	 like	 in	 AU	 (αυ),	
    giving	us	[av]	or	[af],	or	EU	(ευ),	giving	us	[ev]	or	[ef],	the	“u”	(not	in	combination)	
    by	itself	gives	us	an	“i”	[i]	sound.	So,	D-U-O,	δύο	[dhío].	That’s	where	we	got	“duo”	
    from	 in	 English;	 it	 was	 just	 misunderstood	 in	 English.	 In	 English,	 they	 took	 δύο	
    [dhío],	no,	and	it	looks	like	“duo”,	and	they	took	that	and	used	that	to	describe,	
    you	know,	a	set	of	two,	usually	in	music,	a	musical	duo,	for	example.	But	this	is	
    pronounced	[dhío]	in	Greek.		
	
S:	 Δύο.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	want	to	write	two	books?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	γράψω	δύο	βιβλία	[thélo	na	ghrápso	dhío	vivlía].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλω	να	γράψω	δύο	βιβλία.	Very	good.	So	this	is	closed,	no?	It’s	not	any	
    more	 I	 want	 to	 write	 books;	 it’s,	 I	 want	 to	 write	 two	 books.	 Very	 good.	 So,	 we	
    need	to	look	at	how	we	are	referring	to	time,	and	to	understand	the	code	in	which	
    we	refer	to	time	in	Greek.	We	need	to	listen.	We	need	to	actively	listen	to	how	
    these	two	different	forms	are	used	in	context,	and	there	we	will	really	develop	a	
    great	understanding	of	how	we	can	switch	between	these	two	forms.		
	
	 Now,	 many	 courses	 and	 course	 books,	 and	 also	 native	 speakers	 when	 you	 ask	
    them,	 will	 oversimplify	 this	 phenomenon	 to:	 Oh,	 you	 use	 the	 alternative	 form	
    after	να	[na],	or	in	the	future.	And	that’s	not	the	case;	that’s	a	gross	simplification,	
    which	will	lead	to	many	confusions	later	of	not	understanding	why	the	alternative	
    form	is,	or	isn’t	being	used.	We	want	to	do	what	we’ve	been	doing	here	–	asking	
    ourselves	 if	 we’re	 referring	 to	 an	 ongoing	 or	 open	 period	 of	 time,	 in	 which	 case	


                                                                                                   112
    we	used	the	standard	verb	form,	or	to	a	closed	period	or	amount	of	time,	in	which	
    case	 we	 use	 the	 alternative	 version.	 And	 we	 will	 always	 be	 listening	 out	 to	 see	
    whether	Greek	agrees	with	our	conclusions	about	whether	something	is	an	open	
    or	closed	period	of	time.

Teacher:	How	was,	I	learn,	or	I’m	learning,	related	to	the	English	“maths”?		
	
Student:	Μαθαίνω	[mathéno].		
	
T:	 Μαθαίνω.	 So	 μαθαίνω	 by	 itself	 is,	 I	 learn,	 or	 I’m	 learning,	 no?	 But	 after	 θα,	 θα	
    μαθαίνω	will	only	give	us,	I	will	be	learning,	this	open	feeling.	So,	μαθαίνω	has	an	
    alternative	 version	 to	 give	 us	 that	 closed	 feeling	 in	 time.	 Μαθαίνω	 becomes,	
    μάθω	[mátho].		
	
S:	 Μάθω.		
	
T:	 So	just	the	EN	[en]	disappears;	μαθαίνω	[mathéno]	becomes	μάθω	[mátho].	So,	if	
    you	say,	for	example,	I	want	to	learn,	and	you	mean	generally	in	your	life,	I	want	
    to	learn,	how	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μαθαίνω	[thélo	na	mathéno].

S:	 Θέλω	να	το	μάθω	[thélo	na	to	mátho].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 να	 το	 μάθω.	 You	 could	 actually	 say,	 I	 want	 to	 learn	 to	 do	 it.	 How	
    would	that	be?	So	we	start	at	the	beginning:	I	want.

T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	να	μάθω	να	το	κάνω	[thélo	na	mátho	na	to	káno],	no?	Just	as	in	
    English	 we	 can	 have	 a	 few	 “to”	 verbs	 there	 together	 –	 I	 want	 to	 learn	 to	 do	 it.	
    Same	 in	 Greek,	 we	 just	 keep	 going	 with	 the	 να	 [na],	 no?	 Θέλω	 να	 μάθω	 να	 το	
    κάνω.	 So,	 μαθαίνω	 [mathéno]	 becomes	 μάθω	 [mátho]	 in	 its	 alternative	 form.	
    What	was,	I	bring?		
	
S:	 Φέρνω	[férno].		
	
T:	 Φέρνω	is,	I	bring,	or	I’m	bringing.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	I’m	bringing	it?		
	


                                                                                                114
S:	 Το	φέρνω	[to	férno].		
	
T:	 Το	φέρνω.	How	would	you	say,	I	will	be	bringing?		
	
S:	 Θα	φέρνω	[tha	férno].		
	
T:	 Θα	φέρνω.	So,	like	I	said,	we’re	not	working	with	direct	translations;	we	want	to	
    imagine	the	situation,	no?	I	will	be	bringing	is	a	very	weird	thing	to	say	in	English,	
    but	what	we	are	thinking	about	is	an	open	period	of	time,	so	maybe	I’m	talking	
    about	travelling	much	more	often.	I’m	going	to	travel	much	more	often,	so	I	will	
    be	bringing	much	more	treats,	no?	There	it	makes	perfect	sense.	Θα	φέρνω.	But	if	
    you	want	to	say	something	like,	I	will	bring	it,	and	you	refer	to	one	act	of	bringing	
    something,	no?	There	you	are	referring	to	a	closed	period	of	time;	you	need	the	
    alternative	 version	 of,	 φέρνω.	 The	 alternative	 version	 of	 φέρνω	 is,	 φέρω	 [féro].	
    Φέρω.		
	
S:	 Φέρω.		
	
T:	 So	that’s	actually	what	we	have	in	“periphery”.	What	we	have	in	periphery	is	the	
    alternative	version;	we	have	φέρω.	So	what	happens	between	φέρνω	[férno]	and	
    φέρω	[féro]?		
	
S:	 The	N	(ν)	disappears.		
	
T:	 The	N	disappears.	Just	like	what	happened	between,	μαθαίνω	[mathéno]	and	…	?		
	
S:	 Μάθω	[mátho].		
	
T:	 Μάθω.	 So	 actually	 we	 are	 identifying	 a	 pattern	 here.	 The	 pattern	 to	 get	 our	
    alternative	version	of	the	verb:	many	times	you	can	just	get	rid	of	the	N	(μαθαίνω	
    –	μάθω,	or	in	this	case	the	EN	[en]).	Φέρνω	–	φέρω.	I	will	bring	it?		
	
S:	 Το	φέρω	…	Θα	το	φέρω	[tha	to	féro].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	φέρω.	She	will	bring	it?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	φέρει	[tha	to	féri].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	φέρει.	You	remember	how	was,	I	manage?	I	under-bring.		
	
S:	 Καταφέρνω	[kataférno].		
	
T:	 Καταφέρνω.		
	
S:	 Καταφέρνω.		
	
T:	 Καταφέρνω.	So	the	alternative	version	of,	καταφέρνω	is	...	?		


                                                                                           115
	
S:	 Καταφέρω	[kataféro].		
	
T:	 Καταφέρω.	How	would	you	say,	I	will	manage	it?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	καταφέρω	[tha	to	kataféro].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	καταφέρω.	How	was,	I’m	going	down?		
	
S:	 Καταβαίνω	[katavéno]?	
	
T:	 Κατεβαίνω	[katevéno].		
	
S:	 Κατεβαίνω	[katevéno].		
	
T:	 There	we	have	an	[e],	[e].	Κατεβαίνω.		
	
S:	 Κατεβαίνω.		
	
T:	 Κατεβαίνω.	What	do	you	think	the	alternative	version	of,	κατεβαίνω,	might	be?		
	
S:	 Κατεβ	...		
	
T:	 That	was	it!		
	
S:	 Κατέβω	[katévo].		
	
T:	 Κατέβω,	 κατέβω.	 It’s	 kind	 of	 harder	 to	 take	 something	 off	 than	 to	 change	 it.	 It	
    would	 be	 easier	 to	 change	 it	 like,	 γράφω/γράψω	 [ghráfo/ghrápso].	 We	 have	 to	
    think	a	little	bit	more	to	take	something	out.	So	κατεβαίνω	[katevéno]	becomes	
    κατέβω	[katévo].		
	
S:	 Κατέβω.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	will	go	down?		
	
S:	 Θα	κατέβω	[tha	katévo].		
	
T:	 Θα	Κατεβώ.	Θα	Κατεβώ.	We	saw	that	the	word	for	“in”	or	“on”	is,	σε	[se].	Σε.		
	
S:	 Σε.		
	
T:	 Like	 in	 the	 house	 –	 σε	 το	 σπίτι	 [se	 to	 spíti],	 which	 becomes	 στο	 σπίτι	 [sto	 spíti].	
    You	can	use	this	σε	like	in,	σε	λίγο	[se	lígho],	in	a	bit,	σε	λίγο.	Meaning	like,	in	a	
    little	while,	in	a	bit,	in	a	little	while.	And	of	course	that’s	with	γάμα	[gháma],	the	
    [gh]	of	εγώ	[eghó].	Σε	λιγο.	I	will	come	down	–	I	will	go	down,	in	a	bit?		
	


                                                                                                  116
S:	 Θα	κατέβω	σε	λίγο	[tha	katévo	se	lígho].		
	
T:	 Θα	κατέβω	σε	λίγο.	We	will	go	down	in	a	bit.		
	
S:	 Θα	κατέβουμε	σε	λίγο	[tha	katévume	se	lígho].		
	
T:	 Θα	κατέβουμε	σε	λίγο.	Very	good.	And	we’ve	seen	how	we	can	also	begin	with,	
    να	[na]	to	get	the	feeling	of	“let’s”,	no?	So	again,	we	have	to	think	about	whether	
    we	want	the	standard,	open	verb	feeling,	or	the	alternative,	closed	feeling.	So	if	
    we	say,	for	example,	Let’s	go	down,	mostly	we’ll	be	referring	to	a	specific	occasion	
    or	a	specific	visit	or	reason,	no?	So	that’s	closed.	So	how	would	that	be:	Let’s	go	
    down?		
	
S:	 Να	κατέβω	…	Να	κατέβουμε	[na	katévume].		
	
T:	 Να	κατέβουμε.	Good.	Let’s	is	let	us,	no?	It’s	“us”,	it’s	“we”.	Να	κατέβουμε.	Let’s	
    go	down	in	a	bit.	How	would	that	be?	Let’s	go	down	in	a	bit.		
	
S:	 Να	κατέβουμε	σε	λίγο	[na	katévume	se	lígho].		
	
T:	 Να	κατεβούμε	σε	λίγο.	We	could	also	say,	Shall	we,	just	by	changing	the	tone	of	
    voice.	Shall	we	go	down	in	a	bit?		
	
S:	 Να	κατέβουμε	σε	λίγο;	[na	katévume	se	lígho?].		
	
T:	 Να	 κατεβούμε	 σε	 λίγο;	 Very	 good.	 What	 was,	 I	 understand?	 It	 also	 started	 with	
    κατα	[kata]	in	this	case.		
	
S:	 Κατα	…		καταλαβαίνω	[katalavéno].		
	
T:	 Καταλαβαίνω.	Good.	How	do	you	think	the	alternative	version	might	be?		
	
S:	 Καταλαβώ	[katalavó]?		
	
T:	 Good.	Καταλάβω	[katalávo].	I	want	you	to	understand.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	κατα	...	λάβεις.		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	καταλάβεις	[thélo	na	katalávis].	I	want	you	to	understand	me.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	με	καταλάβεις	[thélo	na	me	katalávis].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	με	καταλάβεις.	So	that	would	mean,	I	want	you	to	understand	me,	in	a	
    specific	situation	–	in	a	specific	situation,	referring	to	something	closed,	a	closed	
    period	of	time.	But	if	you	meant	in	life,	generally,	I	want	you	to	understand	me	…	?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	με	καταλαβαίνεις	[thélo	na	me	katalavénis].		


                                                                                         117
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	να	με	καταλαβαίνεις.	So	we	go	back	to	our	standard,	our	open	
    form	of	the	verb.	Θέλω	να	με	καταλαβαίνεις.		
	
  	                           	




                                                                             118
Complete	Greek,	Track	27	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	We	were	looking	at	how	we	use	our	two	different	verb	forms	in	Greek,	no?	
    And	we’ve	also	noticed	some	patterns	between	the	two	forms	in	themselves,	no?	
    So	for	example,	we	had,	I	learn:	μαθαίνω	[mathéno]	and	μάθω	[mátho].	We	had,	I	
    go	 down:	 κατεβαίνω,	 κατέβω	 [katevéno,	 katévo].	 I	 understand:	 καταλαβαίνω,	
    καταλάβω	[katalavéno,	katalávo].	Also,	I	bring:	φέρνω,	φέρω	[férno,	féro].	So	we	
    see	 how	 we’ve	 been	 removing	 the	 N	 (ν)	 or	 the	 EN	 (αιν),	 and	 that’s	 a	 pattern.	
    μαθαίνω/μάθω,	φέρνω/φέρω.	And	this	φέρω,	of	course,	is	the	part	that	we	find	
    building	 other	 vocabulary	 normally,	 no?	 Like	 in	 periphery,	 euphoria:	 looks	 much	
    more	like	that	alternative	form,	φέρω.	We	saw	πίνω	[píno],	I	drink.	Πίνω.		
	
Student:	Πίνω.		
	
T:	 How	do	you	think	the	alternative	form	of,	πίνω	might	be?		
	
S:	 Πίω	[pío].		
	
T:	 Good,	πιω	[pyó].		
	
S:	 Πιω.		
	
T:	 Good,	so	we	lose	the	N	and	it	sounds	like	πιω.	Good.	So	if	you	wanted	to	say	for	
    example,	I	want	to	drink,	and	you	mean	like,	now,	for	example.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	πίω	[thélo	na	pío].		
	
T:	 Good,	and	the	accent’s	on	the	end	–	θέλω	να	πιω	[thélo	na	pyó].	The	accent	falls	
    on	the	end	here	when	we	change	it	from	πίνω	to	πιω.		
	
S:	 Ah,	θέλω	να	πιω.		
	
T:	 Good.	I	don’t	want	to	drink?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	πιω	[dhen	thélo	na	pyó].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 θέλω	 να	 πιω.	 So	 this	 is	 a	 closed	 feeling,	 so	 it	 would	 mean	 like,	 now	 at	 the	
    party	 we’re	 talking	 about.	 But	 imagine	 you	 want	 to	 say	 something	 like,	 I	 don’t	
    want	to	be	a	person	that	drinks,	you	know?	I	don’t	want	to	be	a	drinker.	If	you	say,	
    I	don’t	want	to	drink,	and	that’s	your	meaning,	how	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Θελω	...	Δεν	θέλω	να	πίνω	[dhen	thélo	na	píno].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θέλω	να	πίνω.	Perfect.	So	we	go	back	to	our	standard	form	of	the	
    verb,	and	that	gives	us	our	open	feeling,	our	ongoing	feeling.	“I	take”	in	Greek	is	
    παίρνω	[pérno].		
	


                                                                                                119
S:	 Παίρνω	[pérno].		
	
T:	 Παίρνω.	 That’s,	 I	 take,	 or	 I’m	 taking.	 So	 that’s	 like	 P-E-R-N-O,	 παίρνω.	 So	 you	
    could	say	for	example,	I	take	the	train.	The	train	is,	το	τρένο	[to	tréno].		
	
S:	 Παίρνω	το	τρένο	[pérno	to	tréno].		
	
T:	 Παίρνω	το	τρένο.	How	would	you	say,	We’re	taking	the	train?		
	
S:	 Παίρνουμε	το	τρένο	[pérnume	to	tréno].		
	
T:	 Παίρνουμε	 το	 τρένο.	 So	 the	 verb	 by	 itself,	 and	 when	 I	 say	 by	 itself,	 I	 mean	 not	
    introduced	 by	 θα	 or	 να,	 or	 some	 other	 things	 we	 will	 see	 as	 well,	 that	 can	 be,	 I	
    take,	or	I’m	taking,	no?	We	don’t	have	to	worry	about	the	alternative	form	in	that	
    situation.	I	take	the	train,	I’m	taking	the	train,	παίρνω	το	τρένο	[pérno	to	tréno].	
    The	alternative	form	of	παίρνω,	so	that	form	of	the	verb	that	will	give	us	a	closed	
    feeling	in	time,	is	πάρω	[páro].	Πάρω.		
	
S:	 Πάρω	[páro].		
	
T:	 Πάρω.	So	again	we’re	losing	the	N,	no?	But	there’s	another	change	there,	the	[e]?	
	
S:	 The	vowel.		
	
T:	 Yeah,	 well	 done.	 The	 [e]	 of	 παίρνω	 changes	 to	 an	 [a]	 in	 πάρω.	 So	 that’s	 a	 bit	
    irregular,	it’s	a	bit	random.	But	again	it’s	fitting	into	the	same	pattern.	So	we	have	
    παίρνω	[pérno]	and	πάρω	[páro].		
	
S:	 Παίρνω,	πάρω.		
	
T:	 Good.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 We’re	 taking	 the	 train?	 Give	 me	 that	 again.	 We’re	
    taking	the	train.		
	
S:	 Παίρνουμε	το	τρένο	[pérnume	to	tréno].		
	
T:	 Παίρνουμε	το	τρένο.	If	you	wanted	to	say,	Let’s	take	the	train.	So	we	saw	how	we	
    can	get	this	let’s	feeling,	by	beginning	with	να,	and	showing	that	we	mean	let’s,	in	
    the	tone	of	voice.	So	how	would	that	be?	Let’s	take	the	train?		
	
S:	 Να	πάρω	το	τρένο	…	Να	πάρουμε	το	τρένο	[na	párume	to	tréno].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Let’s	is,	let	us:	να	πάρουμε	το	τρένο.	Very	good.	How	would	you	say,	
    Let	him	take	the	train,	like	Let	him	take	the	train,	in	the	sense	of	“I’m	not	going	to	
    pick	him	up,	let	him	take	the	train”.	You	can	do	this	as	well	starting	with	να	[na].		
	
S:	 Mhm	...	Να	πάρει	το	τρένο	[na	pári	to	tréno].		
	


                                                                                                120
T:	 Very	good.	Να	πάρει	το	τρένο,	no?	Να	πάρει	το	τρένο.	We	saw	καλώ	[kaló],	which	
    was,	I	call,	or	I	invite,	καλώ	as	a	verb,	no?	Not	καλό	[kaló]	like	good.	And	for,	to	
    call,	we	can	also	say,	παίρνω	τηλέφωνο	[pérno	tiléfono],	to	take	phone.		
	
S:	 Παίρνω	το	τηλέφωνο	[pérno	to	tiléfono],	or	…	?		
	
T:	 No,	just,	παίρνω	τηλέφωνο	[pérno	tiléfono].		
	
S:	 Mhm.	Παίρνω	τηλέφωνο.		
	
T:	 Good.	So	in	order	to	say,	for	example,	I	will	call	you,	you	will	say,	I	will	take	you	
    phone.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 But,	I	will?		
	
T:	 What’s	will	in	Greek.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	[thélo]?		
	
T:	 It’s	built	of	θέλω.		
	
S:	 Ah,	θα	[tha]!		
	
T:	 Θα,	good.	Ιt’s	built	of,	θέλει	να	[théli	na].	Good.	So,	I	will	take	you	phone,	I	will	call	
    you.		
	
S:	 Θα	σε	πάρω	το	τηλ	...	πάρω	τηλέφωνο.		
	
T:	 Τηλέφωνο.	Very	good.	Θα	σε	πάρω	τηλέφωνο	[tha	se	páro	tiléfono].	Very	good.	If	
    you	were	to	say	then,	I	don’t	want	you	to	call	me,	you	would	say,	I	don’t	want,	να,	
    you	take	me	phone.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	με	πάρεις	τηλέφωνο	[dhen	thélo	na	me	páris	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θέλω	να	με	πάρεις	τηλέφωνο.	I	don’t	want	you	to	call	me,	I	don’t	
    want	you	to	take	me	phone,	huh?	Very	good.		
	
S:	 Okay.

Complete	Greek,	Track	28	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	We	also	saw	“I	write”,	as	in	photography,	no	(writing	with	light),	which	was	
    γράφω	[ghráfo].		
		
Student:	Γράφω	[gráfo].		
	
T:	 So	the	[gh]	is	like	in,	εγώ	[eghó].	Γράφω	[ghráfo].		
	
S:	 Mhm,	εγώ	[egó],	γράφω	[gráfo].		
	
T:	 But	less	like	“guh”	[g],	so	try	it,	[gh].		
		
S:	 [gh].		
	
T:	 Better.		
	
S:	 Γράφω	[ghráfo].		
	
T:	 Γράφω.	Good.		
	
S:	 Γράφω.		
	
T:	 And	what	was	the	closed	version,	the	alternative	version	of	this	verb?		
	
S:	 Γράψω	...	γράψω	[ghrápso].		
	
T:	 Good,	γράψω.	Very	good.	Γράψω.	So,	if	you	say,	I	will	write,	most	of	the	time	in	
    future,	we	will	be	using	this	closed	version	–	most	of	the	time,	not	necessarily.	I	
    will	write,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Θα	γράψω	[tha	ghrápso].		
	
T:	 Θα	 γράψω.	 Good.	 So,	 most	 of	 the	 time,	 I	 will	 write,	 we	 will	 be	 referring	 to	 a	
    specific	situation,	no?	Θα	γράψω.	But	maybe	we	will	say	something	like,	I’ll	still	be	
    writing.	“Still”	gives	us	an	ongoing	feeling.	So	the	word	for	“still”	in	Greek	is	ακόμα	
    [akóma]	or	ακόμη	[akómi].	It	doesn’t	really	make	a	difference	at	all	which	one	you	
    use;	there’s	just	two	coexisting	versions,	ακόμα	and	ακόμη.		
	
S:	 Aκόμα,	ακόμη.		
	
T:	 I	will	be	writing	still?		
	
S:	 Θα	γράφω	ακόμα	[tha	ghráfo	akóma].		
	
T:	 Θα	γράφω,	good.	There	we	have	a	open	feeling,	no?	Θα	γράφω	ακόμα.	Good.	So	
    this	 is	 also	 a	 pattern,	 uh?	 The	 movement	 from	 γράφω	 [ghráfo]	 to	 γράψω	


                                                                                             122
   [ghrápso]	is	also	a	pattern.	You’ll	also	notice	maybe	that	it’s	the	stressed	syllable	
   that	changes	between	the	two	different	versions,	γράφω,	γράψω	–	the	one	that	
   takes	 the	 stress,	 the	 same	 with	 μαθαίνω	 [mathéno]	 and	 μάθω	 [mátho].	 It’s	 the	
   stressed	 syllable	 there	 that	 disappeared.	 So	 when	 we	 move	 between	 our	 two	
   forms,	it’s	the	syllable	that	takes	the	stress	that’s	going	to	change.	We	also	saw,	“I	
   return”,	something	like,	I	on-turn,	if	that	helps.		
	
S:	 Περι	 ...	 επι	 ...	 επιγράφω	 [epighráfo]?	 No,	 επιστρόφη	 [epistrófi]	 ...	 επιστρόφω	
    [epistrófo],	no.	Επιστρέφω	[epistréfo].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Really	 good	 what	 you	 did	 there,	 uh?	 You	 just	 started	 not	 asking	
    yourself,	“Do	I	know?	Don’t	I	know?”	–	not	worrying	about	that;	you	just	started	
    trying	 to	 find	 it	 and	 you	 got	 there.	 Very	 good.	 Επιστρέφω,	 I	 return,	 I’m	 coming	
    back,	I’m	going	back.	Επιστρέφω,	good.		
	
S:	 Επιστρέφω	[epistréfo].		
	
T:	 So	 we	 have	 like,	 επι	 [epi],	 and	 then	 στρέφω	 [stréfo],	 like	 in	 καταστροφή	
    [katastrofí],	no?	So	the	alternative	form	of	επιστρέφω,	might	be?		
	
S:	 Επιστρέψω	[epistrépso].		
	
T:	 Επιστρέψω.	 Good,	 επιστρέψω.	 So,	 I	 return,	 or	 I’m	 returning,	 by	 itself,	 both	
    meanings,	we	get	with	...	?		
	
S:	 Επιστρέφω	[epistréfo].		
	
T:	 Επιστρέφω.	 Good.	 But	 then	 after	να,	after	 θα,	we	 need	 to	 think	about	 what	 we	
    mean.	So	if	we	say	something	like,	I	can’t	come	back?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	επιστρέψω	[dhen	boró	na	epistrépso].		
	
T:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	επιστρέψω.	No?	Most	of	the	time	we	will	be	referring	to	a	specific	
    returning,	 no?	 But	 you	 never	 know.	 You	 might	 be	 saying	 something	 like,	 I	 can’t	
    come	back	at	5	o’clock,	but	today	I	can	come	back.	Generally	I	can’t	come	back	at	
    5	 o’clock,	 but	 today	 I	 can	 come	 back.	 Well,	 in	 this	 case,	 I	 can’t	 come	 back	 at	 5	
    o’clock,	we	mean	generally,	no?	So	how	would	that	be,	I	can’t	come	back?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	επιστρέφω	[dhen	boró	na	epistréfo].		
	
T:	 Good.	“At	5	o’clock”	is,	η	ώρα	πέντε	[i	óra	pénde].	Η	ώρα	πέντε.		
	
S:	 Η	ώρα	πέντε.		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 we	 have	 η	 ώρα	 [i	 óra]	 which	 means	 “the	 hour”,	 and	 that’s	 a	 feminine	
    noun,	 and	 πέντε	 [pénde]	 which	 means	 “five”,	 like	 the	 pentagon	 shape	 with	 five	
    sides,	 or	 the	 pentagram,	 the	 musical	 notation	 with	 five	 lines.	 So	 we	 have,	 πέντε	


                                                                                                123
   meaning	“five”.	Η	ώρα	πέντε.	I	can’t	come	back	at	5	o’clock	generally,	we	mean.	
   “Generally”	is	γενικά	[yeniká].	Γενικά.		
	
S:	 Okay,	γενικά.	Δεν	μπορώ	να	επιστρέφω	...		
	
T:	 Very	good.		
	
S:	 …	η	ώρα	πέντε	…		
	
T:	 Good.		
	
S:	 ...	γενικά.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	So	there	we	have	a	perfect	context	to	justify	επιστρέφω.	Δεν	μπορώ	
    να	 επιστρέφω	 η	 ώρα	 πέντε	 γενικά	 [dhen	 boró	 na	 epistréfo	 i	 óra	 pénde	 yeniká].	
    Or,	γενικά	δεν	μπορώ	να	επιστρέφω	η	ώρα	πέντε	[yeniká	dhen	boró	na	epistréfo	i	
    óra	pénde].	But	…	the	word	for	“but”	is,	αλλά	[alá].	Αλλά.		
	
S:	 Αλλά.		
	
T:	 Good.	Today	I	can	come	back.	“Today”,	you	remember	the	word	for	today?	It	has	
    the	word	day	inside	it	in	Greek	…		
	
S:	 Μέρα	[méra]?		
	
T:	 Μέρα,	it	has	inside.	Today,	what	was	it?		
	
S:	 Σήμερα	[símera].		
	
T:	 Σήμερα.	Good,	σήμερα.	But	today,	I	can	come	back.		
	
S:	 Αλλά	σήμερα	μπορώ	να	επιστρέψω	[alá	símera	boró	na	epistrépso].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.		
	
S:	 Η	ώρα	πέντε	[i	óra	pénde].		
	
T:	 Well	 yeah,	 if	 you	 want	 it.	 So	 all	 together	 we’ll	 have	 something	 like,	 Generally	 I	
    can’t	 come	 back	 at	 5	 o’clock,	 but	 today	 I	 can	 come	 back.	 Γενικά	 δεν	 μπορώ	 να	
    επιστρέφω	η	ώρα	πέντε	αλλά	σήμερα	μπορώ	να	επιστρέψω	[yeniká	dhen	boró	na	
    epistréfo	i	óra	pénde	alá	símera	boró	na	epistrépso].	So	we	see	we	really	need	to	
    look	at	the	context	to	decide	which	version	of	the	verb	we	need,	but	not	all	the	
    time	in	Greek.	Only	after	να,	after	θα,	and	some	other	situations	we	will	see.	We	
    saw	briefly	that	we	can	use,	“It	can”,	like	“maybe”.	How	was,	It	can?	Μπορώ	is,	I	
    can.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	[borí].		


                                                                                               124
	
T:	 Μπορεί.	So	μπορεί	we	can	use	like	maybe,	so	if	you	say	something	like,	Maybe	he	
    is	coming	back	still,	and	you	mean,	on	the	road.	Maybe	he’s	still	 on	the	road.	Is	
    this	 an	 ongoing	 thing	 or	 a	 closed	 thing?	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be,	 Maybe	 he’s	 still	
    coming	back?		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	επιστρέφει	ακόμα	[borí	na	epistréfi	akóma].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μπορεί	να	επιστρέφει	ακόμα,	or	ακόμη	[akómi].	So	this	would	mean,	
    Maybe	he’s	still	on	the	road,	no?	Maybe	he’s	still	in	the	act	of	coming	back.	That	
    open,	ongoing	feeling.	But	if	you	wanted	to	say	something	like,	you	know,	Maybe	
    he	will	still	come	back,	you	know.	Maybe	it’s	still	a	possibility	that	he	returns,	no?	
    Then	here	we	have	a	closed	feeling.	It’s	out	there	in	the	future;	it’s	far	away.	But	
    that	 doesn’t	 make	 it	 ongoing;	 it’s	 closed.	 It’s	 his	 act	 of	 returning.	 Maybe	 he	 will	
    still	return.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	επιστρέψει	ακόμα	[borí	na	epistrépsi	akóma].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μπορεί	να	επιστρέψει	ακόμα.	Very	good.

Teacher:	 Another	 time	 we	 have	 to	 think	 about	 whether	 we	 want	 our	 open	 or	 our	
    closed	version	of	the	verb	…	we’ve	seen	after	να	[na]	after	θα	[tha].	Another	time	
    that	we	will	think	about	it	is	after	the	word	“if”.	If	is	easy	to	remember,	because	
    interestingly	it’s	like,	να	backwards,	αν	[an].		
	
Student:	Αν.		
	
T:	 Which	is	spelt	like	A	(άλφα	[álfa]),	and	like	a	V-shape,	which	gives	us	that	N,	αν.	So	
    if	is	αν,	and	after	αν	we	have	the	option	to	use	either	version	of	the	verb,	which	
    means	we	are	also	obliged	to	think	about	which	one	we	want.	If	we	say	something	
    like,	 We	 can	 do	 it	 if	 you’re	 coming	 back	 tonight;	 if	 you’re	 coming	 back	 tonight,	
    what	do	we	mean?	Do	we	mean,	“We	can	do	it	if	you’re	on	the	road	coming	back”	
    (Open),	or	do	we	mean,	“We	can	do	it	if	you	have	come	back”	(Closed)?		
	
S:	 Closed.		
	
T:	 It’s	a	closed	thing.	So	how	would	you	say	that,	We	can	do	it	if	you’re	coming	back	
    tonight.	So	the	first	bit	is,	We	can	do	it;	We	are	able	to	do	it.		
	
S:	 Μπορούμε	να	το	κάνουμε	[borúme	na	to	kánume].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μπορούμε	να	το	κάνουμε.	The	word	for	“tonight”	is	απόψε	[apópse].	
    Απόψε.		
	
S:	 Απόψε.		
	
T:	 If	you’re	coming	back	tonight.		
	
S:	 Αν	επιστρέψεις	[an	epistrépsis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	And	tonight	was	…	?		
	
S:	 Απόψε.		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μπορούμε	 να	 το	 κάνουμε	 αν	 επιστρέψεις	 απόψε	 [borúme	 na	 to	
    kánume	 an	 epistrépsis	 apópse].	 So	 this	 was	 a	 particularly	 interesting	 sentence,	
    because	in	English	we	were	saying,	If	you’re	coming	back	tonight,	which,	if	we	just	
    look	at	that	seems	open	and	ongoing,	no?	But	if	we	look	at	the	meaning,	we	see	
    that	what	we	are	referring	to	isn’t	the	journey,	you	know,	if	you	are	coming	back;	
    what	we	mean	is,	if	you	come	back,	if	you	have	come	back.	So	we’ve	seen	three	
    situations	 where	 we	 need	 to	 think	 about	 how	 we	 want	 to	 represent	 time,	 and	
    choose	between	our	two	verb	forms.	We’ve	seen	after	θα,	after	να,	and	after	αν.	
    And	 we’ve	 also	 seen	 some	 patterns,	 like	 with	 I	 write,	 γράφω	 [ghráfo]	 to	 γράψω	
    [ghrápso],	like	επιστρέφω	[epistréfo]	to	επιστρέψω	[epistrépso],	which	is,	I	return.	
    “I	cook”	is	μαγειρεύω	[mayirévo].	Μαγειρεύω.

S:	 Μαγειρεύω.		
	
T:	 Good.	Μαγειρεύω,	I	cook.	So,	if	you	say	something	like,	I	don’t	know	if	she	cooks,	
    is	 it	 an	 ongoing	 open	 feeling,	 or	 is	 it	 a	 closed	 feeling?	 Don’t	 decide	 too	 quickly.	
    Have	a	really	good	think	about	it.	Is	it	an	open	feeling,	or	is	it	a	closed	feeling:	I	
    don’t	know	if	she	cooks.		
	
S:	 Open.		
	
T:	 Open,	no?	Because	we’re	talking	about	her	ability	to	cook,	if	she	cooks	generally,	
    so	that’s	an	open	feeling.	So	how	would	you	say	that,	I	don’t	know	if	she	cooks?		
	
S:	 Δεν	ξέρω	αν	αυτή	μαγειρεύει	[dhen	kséro	an	aftí	mayirévi].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Δεν	 ξέρω	 αν	 μαγειρεύει.	 Or,	 δεν	 ξέρω	 αν	 αυτή	 μαγειρεύει.	 Or,	 αν	
    μαγειρεύει	 αυτή.	 So	 there	 we	 have	 the	 open	 feeling.	 The	 closed	 version,	 the	
    alternative	version	of,	μαγειρεύω	is	μαγειρέψω	[mayirépso].	Μαγειρέψω.	So	the	
    pattern	 that	 we	 saw	 for	 example	 between	 γράφω	 and	 γράψω;	 επιστρέφω,	
    επιστρέψω,	is	F	to	PS,	or	V	to	PS.	We	can	hear	the	V	and	F	are	very	similar	sounds,	
    [f],	 [v].	 So	 they	 are	 joining	 together	 for	 this	 rule	 that	 we	 found:	 F	 or	 V	 to	 PS.	
    Μαγειρεύω,	μαγειρέψω,	I	cook.	“I	travel”,	is	ταξιδεύω	[taksidhévo].	Tαξιδεύω.		
	
S:	 Tαξιδεύω.		
	
T:	 So	how	might	you	expect	the	closed	version	of	ταξιδεύω	to	be?		
	
S:	 Tαξιδέψω	[taksidhépso].		
	
T:	 Tαξιδέψω.	Very	good.	If	you	say,	I	want	to	travel,	and	you	mean	soon,	you	mean	
    this	year.	How	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	ταξιδεύω	[thélo	na	taksidhévo].		
	
T:	 So	just	because	it’s	soon,	it	doesn’t	make	it	ongoing,	no?	We	are	referring	to	the	
    event,	 the	 act	 of	 travelling,	 which	 is	 one	 closed	 thing.	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be,	 I	
    want	to	travel?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	ταξιδέψω	[thélo	na	taksidhépso].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	ταξιδέψω.	Soon,	next	year,	in	a	month,	wouldn’t	make	it	open.	It’s	still	
    closed;	we’re	just	saying	when	you	want	that	closed	thing	to	happen,	no?	But	if	
    you	were	to	say	something	like	“often”,	no?	I	want	to	travel	often,	and	that	makes	
    the	meaning	of	that	verb,	ταξιδεύω	open,	ongoing.	The	word	for	“often”	is,	συχνά	
    [sikhná].	Συχνά.		
	
S:	 Συχνά.		


                                                                                                 127

S:	 Θέλω	να	ταξιδεύω	συχνά	[thélo	na	taksidhévo	sikhná].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	ταξιδεύω	συχνά.	So	if	we	go	back	to,	I	cook	(μαγειρέυω).	If	you	were	to	
    say,	I	want	to	cook,	and	you	mean	like	now,	with	you	guys,	tonight,	this	weekend.	
    How	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μαγειρε	...	μαγειρέψω.		
	
T:	 Good,	 θέλω	 να	 μαγειρέψω	 [thélo	 na	 mayirépso].	 But	 if	 you	 say,	 I	 want	 to	 cook	
    more	often	–	the	word	for	“more”	is	πιο	[pyó].	Πιο.		
	
S:	 Πιο.		
	
T:	 So	how	is,	more	often?		
	
S:	 Πιο	συχνά	[pyó	sikhná].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πιο	συχνά.	So	if	you	were	to	say,	I	want	to	cook	more	often?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μαγειρέψω	...	Νo,	μαγειρεύω	πιο	συχνά.		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θέλω	 να	 μαγειρεύω	 πιο	 συχνά	 [thélo	 na	 mayirévo	 pyó	 sikhná].	 No?	
    That’s	an	ongoing	feeling.	I	want	to	be	cooking	more	often.	Good.		
	
    	                             	




                                                                                          128

Teacher:	“The	journey”	is,	το	ταξίδι	[to	taksídhi].		
	
Student:	Το	ταξίδι.		
	
T:	 You	 might	 hear,	 κάλο	 ταξίδι	 [kálo	 taksídhi]	 in	 Greek,	 good	 journey.	 Like,	 bon	
    voyage,	 no?	 So	 we	 have	 ταξίδι	 –	 journey,	 and	 ταξιδεύω	 –	 I	 travel.	 The	 word	 for	
    “work”	is	δουλειά	[dhuliá].	Δουλειά.		
	
S:	 Δουλειά.		
	
T:	 Good,	with	δέλτα	[dhélta]	(Δ/δ),	very	good.	Δουλειά.	“The	work”	is,	η	δουλειά	[i	
    dhuliá].		
	
S:	 Η	δουλειά.		
	
T:	 So	what	gender	is	this?		
	
S:	 Feminine.		
	
T:	 Feminine.	“I	work”	is,	δουλεύω	[dhulévo].	Δουλεύω.		
	
S:	 Δουλεύω.		
	
T:	 So	 this	 “εύω”	 [évo]	to	get	the	 verb,	you	 will	see	around	 in	Greek,	like	 in	ταξίδι/	
    ταξιδεύω,	δουλειά/δουλεύω.		
	
S:	 Δουλεύω.		
	
T:	 Work	to	I	work.	How	was	tomorrow?		
	
S:	 Αύριο	[ávrio].		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	will	work	tomorrow?		
	
S:	 Θα	δουλέψω	αύριο	[tha	dhulépso	ávrio].		
	
T:	 Θα	 δουλέψω	 αύριο.	 Very	 good.	 So	 you	 could	 get,	 δουλέψω	 by	 yourself	 from	
    δουλεύω.	But,	like	we	said,	it	just	depends	on	context,	and	sometimes	context	is	
    just	in	the	mind.	In	this	case,	both	work.	Θα	δουλέψω	αύριο.	Here	we	have	the	
    feeling	of,	I	will	work	tomorrow	–	we	refer,	we	choose	here	to	refer	to	tomorrow	
    as	a	closed	period	of	time.	But	we	could	also	say,	θα	δουλεύω	αύριο,	and	all	this	
    means	 is,	 I	 will	 be	 working	 tomorrow,	 and	 it’s	 equally	 as	 correct;	 it’s	 just	 the	
    feeling	changes	–	the	feeling	of	how	we’re	referring	to	time	changes.	So	in	some	
    situations,	 in	 some	 situations,	 it	 just	 depends	 on	 what’s	 in	 your	 mind.	 In	 other	
    situations,	 one	 sounds	 right	 and	 the	 other	 one	 sounds	 wrong.	 But	 in	 this	 case,	


                                                                                              129
   “What	are	you	doing	tomorrow?”,	θα	δουλεύω	[tha	dhulévo],	θα	δουλέψω	[tha	
   dhulépso],	both	are	fine.	You	can	also	use,	δουλεύει	[dhulévi]	like,	it	works,	in	the	
   sense	of	like,	it	functions,	you	know?	So,	imagine	you	have	something	that	doesn’t	
   work,	 and	 you	 say	 something	 like,	 “Give	 it	 a	 try,	 maybe	 it	 will	 work”.	 So	 how	
   would	that	be,	Maybe	it	works,	in	this	sense	of,	Maybe	it	will	work.	We	think	it’s	
   not	 working,	 but	 we’re	 going	 to	 give	 it	 a	 try,	 and	 we	 say,	 Maybe	 it	 will	 work.	 Is	
   that	open	or	is	that	closed?		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	δουλέψει	[borí	na	dhulépsi].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Correct.	 Μπορεί	 να	 δουλέψει.	 Good.	 So	 it’s	 not	 working,	 but	 maybe	 it	
    might;	 that’s	 like	 an	 event,	 you	 know?	 Maybe	 it	 will	 work.	 But	 if	 I	 want	 to	 say,	
    Maybe	it	works,	so	we	don’t	know	if	it	works	or	not;	we’re	just	saying,	Maybe	it	
    works.	Is	that	an	open,	ongoing	thing	or	a	closed	thing?		
	
S:	 An	open	thing.		
	
T:	 Yes,	right?	We’re	talking	about	its	state.	If	it’s	working	or	not.	So	how	would	that	
    be,	Maybe	it	works?		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	δουλεύω	...	δουλεύει	[borí	na	dhulévo	…	dhulévi].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Μπορεί	 να	 δουλεύει.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 want	 to	 work	 still?	 And	 what	
    you	 mean	 in	 this	 case	 is,	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 retire;	 I	 want	 to	 work	 still.	 Or	 maybe	 a	
    little	more	Greek	sounding,	Still	I	want	to	work.	Still	I	want	to	work.		
	
S:	 Ακόμα	θέλω	να	δουλεύω	[akóma	thélo	na	dhulévo].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ακόμα	θέλω	να	δουλεύω.	Very	good.	So	we’ve	seen	a	little	about	the

    journey”	(το	ταξίδι	[to	taksídhi]),	“the	work”	(η	δουλειά	[i	dhuliá]),	and	the	verb	–

    (φυτό	[fitó]).	That’s	the	noun,	“a	plant”	(ένα	φυτό	[éna	fitó]),	and	it’s	neuter.	And	
    φυτεύω	 [fitévo],	 “I	 plant”,	 no?	 “I	 plant	 a	 plant”.	 Or,	 for	 example,	 between	 the	
    word	“fish”	(ψάρι	[psári]),	“a	fish”	(ένα	ψάρι	[éna	psári]),	also	neuter,	and	I	fish,	
    I’m	fishing	(ψαρεύω	[psarévo]).	So	this	is	useful	to	notice,	because	it	might	help	
    you	guess	the	meaning	of	new	words	you	come	across,	and	also	guess	words	you	
    might	not	know.

Teacher:	“Agoraphobia”,	in	English,	agoraphobia,	describes	the	fear	of	open	or	public	
    spaces,	 like	 crowded	 spaces	 with	 a	 lot	 of	 people,	 no?	 We	 have	 the	 PH	 there,	
    suggesting	to	us	that	this	is	from	Greek.	And	“phobia”	is,	φόβος	[fóvos]	in	Greek,	ο	
    φόβος	 [o	 fóvos],	 which	 means	 “the	 fear”.	 Agora	 –	 αγορά	 [aghorá]	 in	 Greek	 –	 is	
    “the	marketplace”,	η	αγορά	[i	aghorá].	And	again	we	have	the	[gh]	there,	like	in	
    γράφω	[ghráfo],	εγώ	[eghó].	Η	αγορά,	the	market.		
	
Student:	Η	αγορά.		
	
T:	 So	actually,	η	αγορά	was	market	or	open	space.	The	market	was	set	up	in	an	open	
    space.	So	this	is	where	this	word	comes	from:	agoraphobia	–	the	fear	of	open	or	
    public	 spaces	 like	 the	 marketplace.	 From,	 η	 αγορά,	 we	 can	 get,	 αγοράζω	
    [aghorázo].	Αγοράζω,	which	means	“I	buy”.		
	
S:	 Αγοράζω.		
	
T:	 Αγοράζω.	This	is	the	second	time	we’ve	seen	ζω	[zo]	on	the	end	giving	us	the	verb.	
    Αγορά	to	αγοράζω,	and	we	also	saw	αρχή,	η	αρχή	[i	archí]	–	the	beginning	–	and,	I	
    start,	I	begin?		
	
S:	 Αρχίζω	[archízo].		
	
T:	 Αρχίζω.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	I’m	buying	it?		
	
S:	 Το	αγοράζω	[to	aghorázo].		
	
T:	 Το	αγοράζω.	So,	I	buy	it;	I’m	buying	it.	When	the	verb	is	by	itself	not	introduced	by	
    θα,	να,	αν,	we	just	have,	αγοράζω:	I	buy	or	I’m	buying.	To	get	the	closed	version,	
    the	alternative	version	form	of	the	verb,	αγοράζω,	we	change	the	Z	to	an	S,	and	
    we	get	αγοράσω	[aghoráso].		
	
S:	 Αγοράσω.		
	
T:	 Good.	And	especially	native	English	speakers	are	going	to	have	to	be	really	careful	
    with	 this	 difference,	 because	 the	 S	 by	 itself	 in	 English	 often	 sounds	 like	 a	 Z	
    anyway,	 like	 in	 “is”,	 IS,	 or	 like	 the	 second	 S	 in	 “houses”,	 houses.	 So	 that	 can	 be	
    quite	confusing	for	English	speakers.	You	will	have	to	listen	to	yourself	pronounce	
    to	make	sure	you	get	that	change:	αγοράζω,	αγοράσω	[aghorázo,	aghoráso].	The	
    word	for	“day”	we	saw	was,	μέρα	[méra],	and	today	…	?		
	
S:	 Σήμερα	[símera].		
	
T:	 Σήμερα.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	I	will	buy	it	today?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	αγοράσω	σήμερα	[tha	to	aghoráso	símera].		


                                                                                                 131
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	το	αγοράσω	σήμερα.	Good.	So	if	you’re	a	native	English	speaker,	your	
    ear	is	going	to	tune	very	quickly	to	this	difference	between	[s]	and	[z],	and	you	will	
    notice	it	much	more	than	you	ever	did.	Αγοράσω.	What	was,	the	book?		
	
S:	 Το	βιβλίο	[to	vivlío].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	βιβλίο.	And	how	was,	books,	the	plural?	What	did	βιβλίο	become?		
	
S:	 Βιβλία	[vivlía].		
	
T:	 Βιβλία.	“The	books”	is	τα	βιβλια	[ta	vivlía].	So	not	only	does	βιβλίο	become	βιβλία	
    to	become	plural,	το	becomes	τα	[ta]	if	you	say,	the	books.		
	
S:	 Τα	βιβλία.		
	
T:	 Τα	 βιβλία.	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 I’ll	 buy	 the	 books	 today.	 I	 will	 buy	 the	 books	
    today?		
	
S:	 Θα	αγοράζω	τα	βιβλία	σήμερα	[tha	aghorázo	ta	vivlía	símera].		
	
T:	 Here	I	heard	a	Z.	Αγοράζω	[aghorázo].	So	it	sounds	like,	I	will	be	buying	the	books	
    today,	 like	 open,	 ongoing,	 which	 might	 fit	 in	 some	 contexts,	 but	 much	 more	
    common	would	just	be,	I	will	buy	the	books	today,	a	closed	event,	a	closed	period	
    of	time.	Θα	αγοράσω	τα	βιβλία	σήμερα	[tha	aghoráso	ta	vivlía	símera].	Now	if	you	
    want	 to	 say,	 I’m	 buying	 them	 today,	 and	 you	 refer	 to	 the	 books,	 just	 as	 we	 did	
    when	we	said,	αγοράζω	το	βιβλίο,	and	then,	το	αγοράζω,	for	“I	buy	it”.	Αγοράζω	
    τα	βιβλια	(“I	buy	the	books”),	and	to	say,	I	buy	them,	what	might	you	do?		
	
S:	 Τα	αγοράζω	[ta	aghorázo].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Τα	 αγοράζω.	 So	 that	 “τα”	 then	 becomes	 “them”,	 referring	 to	 the	
    books.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 want	 us	 to	 buy	 them	 today?	 I	 want	 we	 buy	 them	
    today.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	τα	αγοράζουμε	σήμερα	[thélo	na	ta	aghorázume	símera].		
	
T:	 Good.	 What	 this	 feels	 like	 is	 something	 like,	 I	 want	 us	 to	 be	 buying	 them	 today,	
    which	 might	 work	 in	 some	 context,	 uh?	 We	 will	 always	 …	 most	 of	 the	 time	 we	
    could	 find	 a	 context	 where	 it	 will	 fit,	 but	 in	 this	 case	 the	 context	 is	 very	 heavily	
    leaning	to	a	closed	period,	no?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	τα	αγοράσουμε	σήμερα	[thélo	na	ta	aghorásume	símera].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	να	τα	αγοράσουμε	σήμερα.	Let’s	buy	them	today?		
	
S:	 Να	τα	αγοράσουμε	σήμερα	[na	ta	aghorásume	símera].		


                                                                                                   132
	
T:	 Very	good.	Να	τα	αγοράσουμε	σήμερα.	I	want	to	buy	them	often.	What	was	the	
    word	for	often?		
	
S:	 Συχνά	[sikhná].		
	
T:	 Συχνά.	Good.	So	how	would	you	say	that,	I	want	to	buy	them	often?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	τα	αγοράσω	...	No,	…	αγοράζω	συχνά.	(Laughs.)		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	να	τα	αγοράζω	συχνά	[thélo	na	ta	aghorázo	sikhná].	Αγοράζω,	
    our	normal,	standard	version	of	the	verb,	because	we	are	referring	to	something	
    open	 and	 ongoing	 there	 with	 συχνά,	 the	 word	 for	 often.	 Good.	 Give	 me	 again,	
    what	was,	I	start,	or	I’m	starting?		
	
S:	 Αρχίζω	[archízo].		
	
T:	 Αρχίζω.	So	the	closed	version	of	αρχίζω	might	be	...	?		
	
S:	 Αρχίσω	[archíso].		
	
T:	 Αρχίσω.	Very	good.	So	if	you	say	something	like,	Maybe	it’s	starting	soon.	Maybe	
    it’s	 starting	 soon,	 here	 again	 we	 have	 a	 kind	 of	 situation	 where	 both	 are	 fine;	 it	
    just	 depends	 on	 what	 you	 have	 in	 your	 mind.	 Maybe	 it’s	 starting	 soon	 and	 you	
    imagine	 starting	 as	 something	 like	 an	 ongoing	 thing	 that’s	 taking	 place	 soon.	 Or	
    maybe	 it	 starts	 soon.	 In	 this	 case	 both	 work.	 “Soon”	 is	 σύντομα	 [síndoma].	
    Σύντομα.		
	
S:	 Σύντομα.		
	
T:	 How	would	that	be,	Maybe	it’s	starting	soon,	Maybe	it	starts	soon?		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	αρχίζει	...	[borí	na	archízi].		
	
T:	 Either	one!		
	
S:	 …	αρχίσει	σύντομα	[archísi	síntoma].		
	
T:	 Σύντομα	[síndoma].		
	
S:	 Σύντομα	[síndoma].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	give	it	to	me	altogether,	Maybe	it’s	starting	soon.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	αρχίζει	σύντομα	[borí	na	archízi	síndoma].		
	




                                                                                                133
T:	 Yeah,	 in	 this	 case	 we	 could	 have,	 Maybe	 it’s	 starting,	 maybe	 it	 starts,	 whatever	
    feeling	 there	 would	 fit:	 μπορεί	 να	 αρχίζει	 σύντομα,	 μπορεί	 να	 αρχίσει	 σύντομα.	
    So	 that’s	 another	 pattern,	 Z	 to	 S:	 αγοράζω/αγοράσω	 [aghorázo/aghoráso],	
    αρχίζω/	αρχίσω	[archízo/	archíso].	Very	good.		
	
    	                                 	




                                                                                             134
Complete	Greek,	Track	32	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	 So	 we	 saw	 the	 pattern	 of	 Z	 to	 S,	 between	 our	 standard	 and	 our	 closed	
    version	 of	 the	 verb,	 like	 in	 the	 verb,	 “I	 buy”,	 αγοράζω/αγοράσω	 [aghorázo/	
    aghoráso].	 We	 saw	 also	 with,	 “I	 start”,	 αρχίζω	 [archízo],	 and	 then	 the	 closed	
    version,	 αρχίσω	 [archíso].	 But	 this	 doesn’t	 mean	 necessarily	 that	 all	 Z’s	 will	
    become	S’s.	You	might	find	other	patterns	as	well.	For	example,	“I	play”,	is	παίζω	
    [pézo].	Παίζω.		
	
Student:	Παίζω.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	spelt	P,	which	is	the	letter	that	looks	like	the	mathematical	symbol	(Π/π),	
    the	pi,	no;	AI	(αι),	which	gives	us	the	[e]	sound,	like	in	και	[ke],	the	word	for	“and”,	
    like	 in	 ναι	 [ne],	 the	 word	 for	 “yes”;	 ZO	 (ωμέγα	 [omégha]).	 Παίζω,	 “I	 play”.	 The	
    “point”	version	of	παίζω	is	παίξω	[pékso].		
	
S:	 Παίξω.		
	
T:	 So	here	it	doesn’t	become	S,	it	becomes	[ks],	KS,	or	that’s	just	one	letter	in	Greek	
    (Ξ/ξ),	[ks].	Παιξω.		
	
S:	 Παίξω.		
	
T:	 Παίξω.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 Where	 is	 your	 child?	 How	 was,	 my	 friend.	 Do	 you	
    remember	how	to	say,	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Ο	φίλος	μου	[o	fílos	mu].		
	
T:	 Ο	φίλος	μου	–	a	male	friend.	Or	a	female	friend?		
	
S:	 Η	φίλη	μου	[i	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good,	uh?	So,	“the	child”	is,	το	παιδί	[to	pedhí].	We	saw	it’s	neuter,	and	μου	
    [mu]	which	is	“my”,	to	become	“your”	–	what	does	that	M	change	to?		
	
S:	 Σου	[su].		
	
T:	 An	S,	σου.		
	
S:	 Σου.		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	your	child,	is	going	to	be	“the	child	your”.		
	
S:	 Το	παιδί	σου	[to	pedhí	su].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	παιδί	σου.	Where	is,	where	is	your	child?		
	


                                                                                             135
S:	 Πού	...	πού	είναι	το	παιδί	σου;	[pu	íne	to	pedhí	su?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πού	είναι	το	παιδί	σου;	Where	is	your	child?	You	might	want	to	say,	“Oh	he	
    will	still	be	playing”.	You	can	say	that	like	in	the	same	way	as	English,	He	will	still	
    be	playing,	like	you	suppose	it,	no?	He	will	still	be	playing,	using	“will”	in	that	way	
    to	show	assumption.	You	can	do	exactly	the	same	there	in	Greek.	So	how	would	
    that	be,	He	will	still	be	playing?		
	
S:	 Θα	παίζω	[tha	pézo]	...	Νo	...		
	
T:	 Tο	παιδί,	no?	
	
S:	 Si,	si,	το	παιδί.		
	
T:	 So,	not	παίζω,	but	…		
	
S:	 Ah!	Θα	παίζει	ακόμα	[tha	pézi	akóma].		
	
T:	 Θα	 παίζει	 ακόμα,	 no?	 He	 will	 still	 be	 playing:	 he	 will	 still	 be	 out	 there	 playing,	
    probably.	 And	 of	 course	 ακόμα	 there,	 the	 word	 for	 “still”,	 gives	 us	 that	 open,	
    ongoing	 feeling,	 so	 we	 stay	 with	 παίζει	 [pézi];	 we	 don’t	 switch	 to	 παίξει	 [péksi].	
    What	was	the	word	for	book	again?		
	
S:	 Το	βιβλίο	[to	vivlío].		
	
T:	 Βιβλίο.	Good,	or,	το	βιβλιο,	the	book.	And	what	was	books?		
	
S:	 Βιβλία	[vivlía].		
	
T:	 Βιβλία.	So	we	saw	that	to	make	this	neuter	noun	plural,	the	O	changed	to	an	A.	
    Βιβλίο,	βιβλια.	Or,	το	βιβλίο,	τα	βιβλία.	Το	παιδί,	the	child,	also	a	neuter	word,	to	
    make	that	plural,	you	will	add	an	A.	Παιδί	doesn’t	end	in	an	O,	so	you	will	add	that	
    A	 onto	 the	 end.	 And	 it’s	 also	 accented,	 it	 takes	 the	 stress.	 So	 how	 would	 that	
    sound?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	[ta	pedhiá]?		
	
T:	 Good.	 Παιδιά,	 or	 the	 children,	 τα	 παιδιά.	 “They	 want”.	 They	 want,	 is	 θέλουν	
    [thélun].	Θέλουν.		
	
S:	 Θέλουν.		
	
T:	 	So	 for	 they,	 we	 have	 ουν	 [un]	 as	 an	 ending.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 The	 children	
    want	it,	and	the	children	is	like	“they”,	no?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	το	θέλουν	[ta	pedhiá	to	thélun].		
	


                                                                                                136
T:	 Very	good.	Τα	παιδιά	το	θέλουν.	How	would	you	say,	The	children	want	them,	like	
    the	books?	The	children	want	them?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	τα	θέλουν	[ta	pedhiá	ta	thélun].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Τα	 παιδιά	 τα	 θέλουν.	 Τα	 θέλουν	 τα	 παιδιά	 [ta	 thélun	 ta	 pedhiá].	
    Flexible.	How	would	you	say,	The	children	are	playing?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	παίζουν	[ta	pedhiá	pézun].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τα	παιδιά	παίζουν.	Παίζουν	τα	παιδιά	[pézun	ta	pedhiá].	The	children	
    are	playing.	How	would	you	say,	The	children	want	to	play?	So	we	said	that	παίζω	
    [pézo]	becomes	…	?		
	
S:	 Παίξω	[pékso].		
	
T:	 Παίξω.	Good.	So,	The	children	want	to	play.		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	θέλουν	να	παίξουν	[ta	pedhiá	thélun	na	péksun].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τα	παιδιά	θέλουν	να	παίξουν.	Good.	So	this	would	refer	to	something	
    closed,	no?	Like	the	children	here,	these	children	want	to	play.	But	if	you	meant	
    generally,	 Children	 want	 to	 play,	 you	 know	 like,	 all	 children	 want	 to	 play	 –	 in	 a	
    sentence	like	that	in	Greek,	you	will	still	say,	The	children	want	to	play,	when	you	
    refer	to	all	children	in	the	world.	You	will	still	say,	The	children	 want	to	play.	So	
    how	would	that	be?	Children	want	to	play?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	θέλουν	να	παίζουν	[ta	pedhiá	thélun	na	pézun].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Τα	 παιδιά	 θέλουν	 να	 παίζουν.	 Generally,	 γενικά	 [yeniká],	 generally	
    speaking.	Άλλο	[álo],	άλλο	in	Greek,	means	“other”.		
	
S:	 Άλλο.	
	
T:	 “The	other	guy”	is,	ο	άλλος	[o	álos].		
	
S:	 Ο	άλλος.		
	
T:	 The	other	girl,	would	be	…	?		
	
S:	 Η	άλλη	[i	áli].		
	
T:	 Η	 άλλη.	 Good.	 So	 I	 gave	 you	 the	 neuter	 first,	 no?	 Άλλο.	 Το	 άλλο	 βιβλίο	 [to	 álo	
    vivlío],	the	other	book.	Το	άλλο	σπίτι	[to	álo	spíti],	the	other	house.	But,	ο	άλλος,	
    the	 other	 guy,	 or	 the	 other	 one,	 if	 you’re	 referring	 to	 a	 masculine	 thing	 like,	 the	
    other	road.	How	would	you	say	that,	the	other	road?		
	


                                                                                                 137
S:	 Ο	άλλος	δρόμος	[o	álos	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Ο	άλλος	δρόμος.	Good.	But,	ο	άλλος	by	itself	can	be	the	other	guy,	or	the	other	
    one.	Αλλάζω	[alázo],	αλλάζω	means,	“I	change”.		
	
S:	 Αλλάζω.		
	
T:	 So	again	we	have	the	ZO	ending	(ζω)	giving	us	the	verb	from	άλλο:	αλλάζω.	If	you	
    say,	 I	 will	 change,	 αλλάζω	 changes	 like	 παίζω	 changes.	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be,	 I	
    will	change?	And	this	could	mean	like	a	change	of	clothes,	for	example.		
	
S:	 Θα	αλλάξω	[tha	alákso].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	αλλάξω.	And,	I	won’t	change?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	αλλάξω	[dhen	tha	alákso].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θα	αλλάξω.	How	would	you	say,	I	won’t	change	it?	I	will	not	change	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	το	αλλάξω	[dhen	tha	to	alákso].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θα	το	αλλάξω.	I	won’t	change	them?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	τα	αλλάξω	[dhen	tha	ta	alákso].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θα	τα	αλλάξω.	What	was,	It	can,	or	maybe?		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	[borí].		
	
T:	 Μπορεί.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 Maybe	 they	 are	 changing	 it,	 and	 you	 mean	 right	
    now	(Maybe	they	are	in	the	act	of	changing	it.).		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	το	αλλάζουν	[borí	na	to	alázun].		
	
T:	 Μπορεί	να	το	αλλάζουν.	We	saw	that	the	word	for	“soon”	was,	σύντομα	[sídoma/	
    síndoma].	Σύντομα.	So	we	could	also	say	something	like,	Maybe	they’re	changing	
    it	soon,	Maybe	they	will	change	it	soon.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	 να	 το	 αλλάζουν	 ...	 αλλάξουν	 σύντομα	 [borí	 na	 to	 alázun	 …	 aláksun	
    sídoma].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μπορεί	να	το	αλλάξουν	σύντομα	[borí	na	to	aláksun	sídoma].	So	the	
    “soon”	 there	 might	 feel	 like	 something	 ongoing,	 but	 it’s	 not.	 It’s	 just	 the	 when.	
    We’re	still	referring	to	something	closed,	and	σύντομα,	soon,	tells	us	when	that’s	
    happening.	How	would	you	say,	The	other	guy	will	change	it?	The	other	guy	will	
    change	it.		
	


                                                                                              138
S:	 Ο	άλλος	θα	το	αλλάξει	[o	álos	tha	to	aláksi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ο	άλλος	θα	το	αλλάξει.	Θα	το	αλλάξει	ο	άλλος	[tha	to	aláksi	o	álos].	
    The	other	guy	won’t	change	it.		
	
S:	 Ο	άλλος	δεν	θα	άλλαξει	...	δεν	θα	το	αλλάξει.		
	
T:	 Ο	άλλος	δεν	θα	το	αλλάξει	[o	álos	dhen	tha	to	aláksi].	Good.	So	we	saw,	ουν	[un]	
    for	they,	no?	Δουλεύω	was,	“I	work”.	How	is,	They	work?		
	
S:	 Δουλεύουν	[dhulévun].		
	
T:	 Δουλεύουν.	Παίζω,	I	play,	and	They	play?		
	
S:	 Παίζουν	[pézun].		
	
T:	 Παίζουν.	Good.	Αγοράζω	[aghorázo]	is	I	buy,	or	I’m	buying.	And,	They	buy,	they’re	
    buying?		
	
S:	 Αγοράζουν	[aghorázun].		
	
T:	 Αγοράζουν.	And	then	our	closed	version	of	the	verb,	δουλεύουν	[dhulévun]	would	
    become?		
	
S:	 Δουλέψουν	[dhulépsun].		
	
T:	 Δουλέψουν.	Παίζουν	[pézun],	would	become?		
	
S:	 Παίξουν	[péksun].		
	
T:	 Παίξουν.	Αγοράζουν	[aghorázun]	would	become?		
	
S:	 Αγοράσουν	[aghorásun].		
	
T:	 Αγοράσουν.	Good.	So	we	see	all	these	different	patterns,	but	actually	we’re	just	
    seeing	 one	 thing	 happen	 in	 all	 of	 these	 patterns,	 if	 we	 think	 about	 it.	 Generally	
    speaking,	 going	 from	 the	 standard,	 open,	 ongoing,	 version	 of	 our	 verb	 to	 our	
    closed	version	in	Greek,	we	can	only	move	to	one	of	three	sounds:	S	(αγοράζω/	
    αγοράσω	 [aghorázo/aghoráso]);	 KS	 (παίζω/παίξω	 [pézo/pékso]);	 or	 PS	 (γράφω/	
    γράψω	 [ghráfo/ghrápso]).	 Which	 is	 actually	 just	 to	 one	 sound,	 an	 S.	 We	 are	
    always	moving	to	an	S,	no?	We	saw	some	exceptions.	We	saw	like	N’s	fall	away.	
    But	generally	speaking	in	Greek,	for	our	closed	version	of	the	verb,	we	are	moving	
    to	S,	be	it	PS,	KS,	or	just	an	S.		
	
	 In	real	life,	when	you’re	trying	to	find	the	alternative	form	of	a	verb,	you	can	run	
    through	 these	 options	 in	 your	 head,	 and	 the	 one	 you	 heard	 before	 is	 going	 to	
    jump	out	at	you.	So	that’s	a	very	good	trick.	Just	have	a	quick	run	through	those,	


                                                                                               139
   and	 even	 if	 you’ve	 heard	 it	 and	 you	 haven’t	 realised,	 it’s	 going	 to	 stand	 out.	 So	
   maybe	you	come	across	a	verb	like	νομίζω	[nomízo],	which	means	“I	believe”,	and	
   you	 need	 the	 closed	 version	 of	 that	 verb.	 So	 you	 will	 just	 run	 through	 the	
   possibilities	–	νομίξω,	νομίψω,	νομίσω	[nomíkso,	nomípso,	nomíso],	and	if	you’ve	
   heard	one	of	those	before	it’s	going	to	stand	out.		
	
S:	 How	do	you	know?		
	
T:	 You	mean	if	you’ve	never	heard	it?		
	
S:	 Yes.		
	
T:	 Well	 you	 don’t	 know,	 no?	 But	 it’s	 always	 worth	 just	 giving	 a	 quick	 run	 through.	
    That	quick	run	through	is	going	to	take	less	than	a	second,	no?	And	you	will	never	
    know	if	you’ve	heard	it	before,	but	if	you	have	heard	it	a	few	times	you	will	really	
    have	a	strong	feeling	of	which	one	it	should	be.		
	
S:	 Mhm,	okay.		
	
T:	 And	 of	 course	 you	 can	 always	 ask	 whoever	 you’re	 practicing	 with,	 no?	 You	 can	
    say,	θα	…	how	is,	θα	...	,	and	that	should	trigger	in	them	the	closed	version.

Teacher:	The	word	for	“perfect”	in	Greek,	perfect,	is	τέλειο	[télio].	Τέλειο.		
	
Student:	Τέλειο.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	It	is	perfect?		
	
S:	 Είνάι	τέλειος	[íne	télios].	Τέλειο	[télio].		
	
T:	 It	 depends,	 no?	 It	 depends	 …	 it	 depends	 what	 you	 are	 talking	 about,	 no?	 Είνάι	
    τέλειο	[íne	télio],	that	could	be	a	neuter	thing,	no?	Τέλειος	would	be	a	masculine	
    thing,	or	you	also	often	hear	like,	it’s	an	expression	like	“great!”	–	τέλεια!	[télia].	
    Τέλεια.	Τέλεια,	what	does	it	look	like?	What	gender	does	it	look	like?		
	
S:	 Plural	…	?		
	
T:	 Plural.	Plural	what?		
	
S:	 Neutral	plural.		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 I	 was	 expecting	 you	 to	 go	 for	 feminine	 first,	 which	 is	 –	 it	 is	 also	 the	
    feminine.	 The	 A	 can	 also	 be	 feminine,	 like	 we	 saw	 in	 απολογία	 [apoloyía],	
    apology.	 Μέρα	 [méra],	 day.	 But	 here	 the	 A	 is	 neuter	 plural,	 because	 the	 neuter	
    plural	…	so	that	plural	that	we	learnt:	βιβλίο	[vivlío]	to	βιβλία	[vivlía],	for	example,	
    that	also	gives	us	the	adverb.	Now	the	adverb	just	means	the	word	that	has	“-ly”	
    usually	 in	 English.	 So,	 perfectly,	 perfectly.	 And	 perfectly,	 τέλεια	 in	 Greek,	 is	 used	
    quite	often	like	an	expression.	Τέλεια.		
	
S:	 Τέλεια.		
	
T:	 Good.	Τελειώνω	[telióno],	τελειώνω	is,	“I	finish”.	So	literally	maybe	like,	I	perfect,	
    no?	But	it’s,	I	finish,	in	modern	standard	Greek.	Τελειώνω.		
	
S:	 Τελειώνω.		
	
T:	 Τελειώνω.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	They	finish,	or	They’re	finishing?		
	
S:	 Τελειώνουν	[teliónun].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τελειώνουν.	So	τελειώνω	is	our	standard	version	of	the	verb,	and	our	
    closed	version	of	the	verb	that	we	might	need	to	use	after	θα	[tha]	or	να	[na]	or	
    αν	[an],	we’ve	also	seen,	is	τελειώσω	[telióso].		
	
S:	 Τελειώσω.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	I	will	finish	it	tomorrow?		


                                                                                                  141
	
S:	 Θα	το	τελειώσω	αύριο	[tha	to	telióso	ávrio].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	το	τελειώσω	αύριο.	I	will	finish	it	tomorrow.	The	word	for	“when”	
    in	Greek	was	πότε	[póte].	Πότε.		
	
S:	 Πότε,	πότε.		
	
T:	 Good.	How	would	you	say,	When	will	you	finish	it?	When	will	you	finish	it?		
	
S:	 Πότε	θα	το	τελειώσεις;	[póte	tha	to	teliósis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πότε	θα	το	τελειώσεις;	So	we	have,	τέλειο	[télio]	–	perfect,	and	then	
    τελειώνω	[telióno],	the	verb	–	I	finish.	The	word	for	“soon”	was	σύντομα	[sídoma].	
    Σύντομα.		
	
S:	 Σύντομα	[síntoma].		
	
T:	 Like	with	a	D:	σύντομα	[sídoma].		
	
S:	 Σύντομα.		
	
T:	 Good.	They	will	finish	it	soon.		
	
S:	 Θα	το	τελειώσουν	σύντομα	[tha	to	teliósun	sídoma].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θα	 το	 τελειώσουν	 σύντομα.	 Maybe	 they’ll	 finish	 it	 soon.	 So	 we	 said	
    that	we	could	get	the	meaning	of	maybe	with,	It	can.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	[borí].		
	
T:	 Good	so,	Maybe	they’ll	finish	it	soon.		
	
S:	 Μπορεί	να	θα	να	το	τελειώσουν	[borí	na	tha	na	to	teliósun]	...	?		
	
T:	 Yeah,	so	I	think	you	went	just	a	little	bit	too	fast,	no?	We	got	a	little	cluster	of	να’s	
    and	 θα’s	 there	 in	 the	 middle.	 Actually,	 we	 will	 never	 have	 να	 and	 θα	 together,	
    ever.	Because	when	we	make	that	choice	between	the	ordinary,	standard	form	of	
    the	 verb,	 or	 the	 closed	 form,	 we	 receive	 that	 information,	 that	 context,	 no?	 So,	
    Maybe	they’ll	finish	it	soon,	is	“It	can,	να,	they	finish	it	soon”.	But	of	course	when	
    we	say,	They	finish,	we	have	to	make	a	decision.	So	let’s	go	back	to	the	beginning:	
    It	can?		
	
S:	 Μπορεί.		
	
T:	 They	finish	it	soon.		
	


                                                                                             142
S:	 Να	το	τελειώσουν	σύντομα	[na	to	teliósun	sídoma].		
	
T:	 Μπορεί	να	το	τελειώσουν	σύντομα	[borí	na	to	teliósun	sídoma].	Very	good.	The	
    word	for	“cold”	in	Greek	is	κρύο	[krío].	Κρύο.		
	
S:	 Κρύο.		
	
T:	 And	that’s	spelτ	K	–	the	greek	K	(κ);	the	R	sound,	which	is	actually	spelt	with	a	P	
    (ρ),	the	letter	looks	like	a	P	gives	us	an	R.	And	then	we	have	the	U	(υ)	there,	the	I	
    sound	there	is	a	U.	We	saw	how	the	U	out	of	combination	can	give	us	an	I	sound	
    like	in	δύο	[dhío],	δύο,	the	word	for	two,	or	where	we	get	“duo”	from	in	English.	
    And	then	finally	the	O,	the	one	what	looks	like	the	English	O	(ο).	So	it	will	look	like	
    K-P-U-O	(κρύο	[krío]).	Κρύο.		
	
S:	 Κρύο.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	It	is	cold?		
	
S:	 Είναι	κρύο	[íne	krío].		
	
T:	 Είναι	κρύο.	If	you’re	referring	to	the	climate,	you	will	say,	It	makes	cold.	So	how	
    would	that	be,	It	makes	cold?		
	
S:	 Κάνει	κρύο	[káni	krío].		
	
T:	 Κάνει	 κρύο.	 Very	 good.	 You	 could	 also	 say,	 It	 has	 cold,	 for	 the	 climate,	 uh?	 Έχει	
    κρύο	[échi	krío].	Now	to	say,	“I	am	cold”,	you	could	say,	κρυώνω	[krióno].		
	
S:	 Κρυώνω.		
	
T:	 So	 this	 is	 κρύο	 [krío]	 with	 the	 νω	 [no]	 on	 the	 end,	 just	 like	 we	 saw	 with	 τέλειο,	
    τελειώνω	[télio,	telióno].	And	then	we	get	a	verb,	so	this	is	a	verb.	I	am	colding,	I	
    am	colding,	I	am	cold.	Κρυώνω.		
	
S:	 Κρυώνω.		
	
T:	 Good.	How	would	you	say,	Are	you	cold?		
	
S:	 Κρυώνεις;	[kriónis?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Κρυώνεις;	Aren’t	you	cold?	Aren’t	you	cold?		
	
S:	 Δεν	κρυώνεις;	[dhen	kriónis?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	κρυώνεις;	Good.	So	how	would	you	say,	I	don’t	want	to	be	cold?		
	




                                                                                                 143
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	κρυώνω	[dhen	thélo	na	krióno]	…	δεν	θέλω	να	κρυώσω	[dhen	thélo	
    na	krióso].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θέλω	να	κρυώσω.	So	this	would	be	referring	to	a	specific	situation,	
    no?	I’ll	take	my	jacket	because	I	don’t	want	to	get	cold,	I	don’t	want	to	be	cold.	
    Δεν	 θέλω	 να	 κρυώσω.	 But	 κρυώνω,	 you	 might	 want	 to	 use	 in	 a	 different	
    circumstance,	 you	 know,	 if	 you’re	 referring	 to	 ongoing	 time.	 So	 we’ve	 seen:	
    τελειώνω	[telióno]	to	τελειώσω	[telióso],	κρυώνω,	κρυώσω	[krióno,	krióso],	which	
    makes	Ν	quite	an	interesting	letter,	no?	Because	we’ve	seen	that	the	Ν	can	…	?		
	
S:	 Disappear	…		
	
T:	 …	 can	 disappear,	 no?	 We	 have	 παίρνω/πάρω	 [pérno/páro],	 for	 I	 take;	
    φέρνω/φέρω	 [férno/féro],	 for	 I	 bring;	 μαθαίνω/μάθω	 [mathéno/mátho]	 for	 I	
    learn.	The	Ν	can	also	show	us	that	the	verb	is	not	changing	at	all:	κάνω,	περιμένω	
    [káno,	 periméno].	 Κάνω	 and	 περιμένω	 don’t	 have	 alternative	 forms.	 So	 Ν	 can	
    either	disappear,	can	just	stay	with	no	change,	or	here	as	we’ve	seen,	turn	to	an	S.	
    “I	arrive”,	or	“I’m	arriving”,	is	φτάνω	[ftáno].		
	
S:	 Φτάνω.		
	
T:	 Φτάνω.	 I	really	like	this	 word.	It’s	fun	to	 have	the	F	 and	the	T	 together,	no?	It’s	
    odd	to	find	these	two	sounds	together	in	this	way	at	the	beginning	of	a	word.	We	
    have	them	together	in	English,	no?	“After”,	for	example,	but	they’re	two	separate	
    syllables.	But	starting	a	syllable	[ft],	is	very	weird	in	English.		
	
S:	 [ft]	is	difficult.		
	
T:	 Yes	it	is	a	bit	difficult	for	you	as	a	Spanish	speaker	for	sure,	because	again	it’s	like	
    the	ST,	where	you’d	want	to	put	the	E	before,	no?	Φτάνω.	How	would	you	say,	It	
    arrives,	she	arrives,	he	arrives?		
	
S:	 Φτάνει	[ftáni].		
	
T:	 Φτάνει.	
	
S:	 Φτάνει.		
	
T:	 Φτάνει,	it	arrives,	is	also	an	expression.	It’s	a	way	of	saying,	“enough”.	You	just	say	
    φτάνει	–	enough.	How	would	you	say,	It’s	not	enough?		
	
S:	 Δεν	φτάνει	[dhen	ftáni].		
	
T:	 Δεν	φτάνει.	Very	good.	Very	good	on	the	pronunciation	there;	it’s	a	bit	difficult	to	
    put	that	all	together.	Δεν	φτάνει.	Actually,	in	standard	Greek,	you	will	hear	that	Ν	
    being	dropped,	δε	φτάνει	[dhe	ftáni].		
	


                                                                                        144
S:	 Δε	φτάνει.		
	
T:	 Δε	φτάνει.	So	it’s	not	incorrect	to	say,	δεν	φτάνει,	but	you’ll	notice	in	Greek	that	
    before	some	letters,	the	Ν	of	δεν	and	some	other	words	we’ll	see	tends	to	be	left	
    off	before	certain	letters,	and	F	is	one	of	them.	So,	δε	φτάνει.	And	also	in	writing.	
    So	δεν	in	writing	you	can	find	is	δε	or	δεν.	What	was	again	the	word	for	when?		
	
S:	 Πότε	[póte].		
	
T:	 Πότε.	When	will	you	arrive?		
	
S:	 Πότε	φτάνεις;	[póte	ftánis?].		
	
T:	 That’s,	When	are	you	arriving,	no?	That	works,	πότε	φτάνεις;	But	you	could	also	
    say,	When	will	you	arrive?		
	
S:	 Πότε	θα	φτάσεις;	[póte	tha	ftásis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πότε	θα	φτάσεις;	No?	Good.	In	a	little	bit,	in	a	little	bit	...	?		
	
S:	 Σε	λίγο	[se	lígho].		
	
T:	 Σε	λίγο.	Very	good.	I	will	arrive	in	a	bit,	I	will	arrive	in	a	bit.		
	
S:	 Θα	φτάσω	σε	λίγο	[tha	ftáso	se	lígho].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	φτάσω	σε	λίγο.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	arrive,	or	I’m	arriving?		
	
Student:	Φτάνω	[ftáno].		
	
T:	 Φτάνω.	Good.	And,	Τhey	arrive?		
	
S:	 Φτάνουν	[ftánun].		
	
T:	 Φτάνουν,	 good.	 And	 I	 should	 mention	 that	 we	 have	 a	 variation	 on	 the	 “they”	
    form:	-ουν	[un]	or	-ουνε	[une],	with	all	verbs,	so	you	might	hear	φτάνουν	[ftánun]	
    or	φτάνουνε	[ftánune].	It	doesn’t	make	any	difference.	You	can	use	either.	Maybe	
    you	notice	that	some	people’s	individual	dialects,	their	idiolects	–	we	all	have	our	
    individual	dialect	–	that	a	certain	person	might	prefer	one	over	the	other,	and	also	
    dialects	 of	 certain	 regions,	 they	 might	 prefer	 one	 over	 the	 other.	 But	 it’s	 not	
    something	you	have	to	worry	about.	Φτάνουν	or	φτάνουνε.		
	
	 If	you	want	to	stress	the	word	for	“they”,	you	know,	if	you	want	to	say,	they’re	
    arriving,	not	us,	well	you	need	to	know	the	word	for	“they”,	no?	This	will	depend	
    on	 if	 you	 have	 a	 male	 group,	 a	 mixed	 group,	 or	 a	 female	 group.	 So	 they	 is	 the	
    plural	 of	 he,	 she,	 and	 it.	 And	 that’s	 not	 obvious	 in	 English,	 because	 those	 words	
    don’t	look	like	each	other.	They	doesn’t	look	like	he	or	she.	But	if	you	think	about	
    it,	 you	 obviously	 know	 two	 he’s,	 you	 refer	 to	 them	 as	 they.	 And	 two	 she’s,	 you	
    refer	to	them	as	they.	And	two	it’s	is	they.	So	they	is	the	plural	of	he,	she,	and	it.	
    What	is	the	word	for	she	in	Greek.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	[aftí].		
	
T:	 Αυτή.	So	we	need	the	plural	of	the	word	αυτή,	if	we	are	referring,	for	example,	to	
    an	all-female	group,	no?	This	is	αυτές	[aftés].	Αυτές.		
	
S:	 Αυτές.		
	
T:	 Good.	So	this	means	they,	referring	just	to	females	or	to	feminine	things,	no?	So	
    how	 would	 you	 say,	 They	 want,	 and	 you’re	 emphasizing	 the	 word	 for	 they,	 that	
    feminine	group?	They	want?		
	
S:	 Αυτές	θέλουν	[aftés	thélun].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτές	θέλουν.	Αυτές	θέλουνε	[aftés	thélune].	What	was	the	word	for	
    but?		
	
S:	 Αλλά	[alá].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αλλά.	We	–	and	we	will	emphasize	the	word	for	“we”	–	We	don’t	want	but	
    they	want,	they	do.	We	don’t	want	but	they	do.		


                                                                                               146
	
S:	 Εμείς	δεν	θέλουμε	αλλά	αυτές	θέλουνε	[emís	dhen	thélume	alá	aftés	thélune].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Εμείς	 δεν	 θέλουμε	 αλλά	 αυτές	 θέλουν	 [emís	 dhen	 thélume	 alá	 aftés	
    thélun]	 ...	 αυτές	 θέλουνε	 [aftés	 thélune].	 So,	 for	 they	 do,	 we	 just	 repeat	 they	
    want:	αλλά	αυτές	θέλουν.	What	was	the	word	for,	It	is,	he	is,	she	is?		
	
S:	 Είναι	[íne].		
	
T:	 Είναι,	good.	The	word	for,	“They	are”,	is	also	είναι	–	it	doesn’t	change.		
	
S:	 Είναι.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	She	is?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	[aftí	íne].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	είναι.	And,	They	are,	for	our	female	group?		
	
S:	 Αυτές	είναι	[aftés	íne].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	it	doesn’t	change:	είναι	αυτή,	είναι	αυτές	[íne	aftí,	íne	aftés].	Έίναι.	How	
    would	you	say,	Ιt	is	there?	Do	you	remember	the	word	for,	there?		
	
S:	 Έκει	[éki]?		
	
T:	 Εκεί	[ekí],	good.	So,	It	is	there?		
	
S:	 Εκεί	είναι	[ekí	íne].		
	
T:	 You	could	put	εκεί	first,	εκεί	είναι.	That	would	just	be	a	bit	emphatic,	like,	Τhere	it	
    is’,	no?	But	the	most	normal	order	would	be	...	?		
	
S:	 Είναι	εκεί	[íne	ekí].		
	
T:	 Είναι	εκεί,	good.	How	would	you	say,	They	are	there?		
	
S:	 Αυτές	είναι	εκεί	[aftés	íne	ekí].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	this	would	be	for	women	or	for	feminine	objects,	no?	Αυτές	είναι	εκεί.	
    And	as	you	did,	we	can	say	the	word	αυτές	if	we	need	to	clarify,	which	you	might	
    need	to,	with	so	many	different	meanings	for	είναι	[íne].	We	saw	that	the	word	
    for	“that”,	like	“that	day”,	for	example,	we	built	on	the	word	for	“there”.	How	was	
    that	word?	The	word	for,	that?		
	
S:	 Εκεί	…	[ekí	…	]	–	it	depends	on	the	word?		
	


                                                                                            147
T:	 Good,	good.	So	give	me	one	of	them.		
	
S:	 Ah.	Εκείνος,	εκείνη,	εκείνο	[ekínos,	ekíni,	ekíno].		
	
T:	 Good,	 good,	 very	 good.	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be	 then	 for	 the	 feminine	 plural	 for	
    those	(feminine	things),	or	even	for,	those	females,	those	girls?		
	
S:	 Eκείνες	[ekínes].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	So,	εκείνες	can	mean	those,	those	ones,	referring	to	feminine	things,	
    or	those	girls,	those	women.	So	if	you	were	to	say,	those	want,	those	girls	want,	
    how	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Εκείνες	θέλουν	[ekínes	thélun].		
	
T:	 Good.	Εκείνες	θέλουν.	How	would	you	say,	Those	females	–	they	over	there	–	are	
    doing	it?		
	
S:	 Εκείνες	κάνουν...	εκείνες	το	κάνουν	[ekínes	to	kánun].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Εκείνες	 το	 κάνουν,	 or	 εκείνες	 το	 κάνουνε	 [ekínes	 to	 kánune].	 So	 this	 also	
    means	 that	 we	 have	 the	 main	 plural	 pattern	 for	 feminine	 nouns.	 Nouns	 were	
    those	words	we	can	put	“the”	or	“a”	in	front	of	like,	“the	day”,	for	example.	How	
    was	day	in	Greek?	Καλη	[kalí]	…		
	
S:	 Μέρα	[méra].		
	
T:	 Yes,	 we	 have	 that	 popular	 greeting,	 καλημέρα	 [kaliméra],	 and	 that’s	 of	 course	
    literally	“good	day”,	so	we	have	μέρα	for	day.	So	μέρα	is	feminine	and	is	going	to	
    become	plural,	just	like	αυτή	[aftí]	to	αυτές	[aftés].	So	that	ES	(-ες)	ending	to	get	
    the	plural	is	going	to	work	also	for	μέρα.	So	how	would	you	say	that,	days?		
	
S:	 Μέρες	[méres].		
	
T:	 Yes,	μέρες,	good.	If	you	want	to	say,	the	days,	the	days,	the	word	for	“the”	is	the	
    same	sound	as	with	the	singular.	So,	we	have,	η	μέρα	[i	méra]	and,	the	days?		
	
S:	 Οι	μέρες	[i	méres].		
	
T:	 Οι	 μέρες.	 Good.	 So	 this	 οι	 [i]	 sounds	 the	 same,	 the	 word	 for	 “the”	 (Η/η	 [ι]);	 it	
    doesn’t	change	here,	but	it’s	spelt	differently.	It’s	spelt	OI	(οι).	So	OI	in	Greek	also	
    just	gives	us	[i];	the	combination	of	OI	gives	us	the	[i]	sound.	And	it’s	associated	
    with	plurals.	So	when	you	write	“the	days”,	that’s	spelt	with	OI,	οι	μέρες	[i	méres].	
    How	would	you	say,	those	days?		
	
S:	 Eκείνες	οι	μέρες	[ekínes	i	méres].		
	


                                                                                                148
T:	 Very	good.	Eκείνες	οι	μέρες.	And,	these	days?		
	
S:	 Αυτές	οι	μέρες	[aftés	i	méres].		
	
T:	 Αυτές	οι	μέρες.	So	αυτές	[aftés]	is	they,	and	also	these.		
	
    	                             	




                                                                  149

Teacher:	 So	 tell	 me	 again	 what	 was	 the	 word	 for	 she,	 and	 also	 the	 word	 for	 this,	
    referring	to	feminine	things?		
	
Student:	Αυτή	[aftí].		
	
T:	 Good,	and	the	word	for	they,	referring	to	females	or	feminine	things,	and	also	the	
    word	for	these,	referring	to	feminine	things?		
	
S:	 Αυτές	[aftés].		
	
T:	 Αυτές,	good.	The	plural	of	αυτός	[aftós]	is	entirely	more	interesting.	The	plural	of	
    αυτος	 is	 αυτοί	 [aftí].	 But	 this	 αυτοί	 is	 spelt	 OI	 (οι).	 So	 I	 mentioned	 that	 the	 OI	
    spelling	of	the	[i]	sound	is	associated	with	plurals.	We’ve	seen	how	the	[i]	sound,	
    which	 is	 used	 a	 lot	 in	 the	 grammar,	 no,	 to	 show	 different	 things	 like	 the	 verb	
    ending	or	the	feminine,	is	spelt	in	a	different	way	depending	on	what	it’s	showing.	
    We	saw	the	feminine	[i]	with	that	N-	or	H-shaped	letter	(η/Η);	we	saw	the	[i]	on	
    the	 end	 of	 the	 verb	 like	 κάνει	 [káni],	 φτάνει	 [ftáni],	 τελειώνει	 [telióni],	 which	 is	
    like	 EI	 (ει);	 and	 now	 the	 plural	 [i]	 sound,	 OI	 (οι).	 So,	 the	 plural	 of	 αυτός	 (αυτοί),	
    sounds	just	like	“she”,	but	it’s	spelt	differently.	If	you	wanted	to	say,	for	example,	
    They	 are	 finishing,	 not	 us.	 Let’s	 start	 with,	 They	 are	 finishing,	 emphasizing	 that	
    male	or	mixed	group.		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	τελειώνουν	[aftí	teliónun].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτοί	τελειώνουν.	They’re	finishing	(Αυτοί	τελειώνουν),	not	us.	So	for,	not	
    us,	we	could	say,	“no	we”.	You	remember	the	word	for	“no”?	I	mentioned	it	really	
    briefly.		
	
S:	 Δεν	[dhen]?		
	
T:	 That’s	the	word	for	“not”,	but	the	word	for	“no”	is	όχι	[óchi].		
	
S:	 Όχι.		
	
T:	 Όχι.	And	the	word	for,	we?		
	
S:	 Εμείς	[emís].		
	
T:	 Yeah.	So	how	would	that	be,	not	us?		
	
S:	 Όχι	εμείς	[óchi	emís].		
	
T:	 Good.	 They’re	 finishing,	 not	 us.	 Αυτοί	 τελειώνουν,	 όχι	 εμείς	 [aftí	 teliónun,	 óchi	
    emís].	 We’re	 still	 going.	 So	 this	 also	 means	 we	 have	 the	 main	 plural	 pattern	 for	



                                                                                                    150
   masculine	 nouns	 as	 well,	 so	 we	 can	 think	 of	 a	 masculine	 noun	 that	 we’ve	 come

S:	 Δρόμος	[dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Δρόμος.	So	how	would	roads	be?	
	
S:	 Δρόμοι	[dhrómi].		
	
T:	 Δρόμοι.	And	how	is	that	spelt,	that	[i]	sound	on	the	end?		
	
S:	 OI	(οι).		
	
T:	 Good.	The	roads	…	first	give	me,	the	road.	What	is	the	word	for	the,	for	masculine	
    singular,	the	road?		
	
S:	 Ο	δρόμος	[o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Good.	Ο	δρόμος.	Now,	the	roads,	is	οι	δρόμοι	[i	dhrómi].

S:	 OI.		
	
T:	 Good.		
	
S:	 Both,	both?		
	
T:	 Both	of	them,	of	course.	Well	actually,	that’s	where	I	was	going.	If	you	would	say,	
    these	roads,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	οι	δρόμοι	[aftí	i	dhrómi].		
	
T:	 Good.	And	of	course	all	spelt	OI,	OI,	OI,	all	the	way	down.	Αυτοί	οι	δρόμοι.	Good.	
    And,	those	roads?		
	
S:	 Eκείνοι	οι	δρόμοι	[ekíni	i	dhrómi].

T:	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 When	 are	 they	 arriving?	 Stressing	 the	 word	 for	 they.	 So,

                                                                                         151
S:	 Πότε	φτάνουν	αυτοί;	[póte	ftánun	aftí?].		
	
T:	 Πότε	 φτάνουν	 αυτοί;	 [póte	 ftánun	 aftí?].	 You	 can	 just	 stick	 αυτοί	 on	 the	 end	
    there,	 or	 you	 could	 have	 it	 at	 the	 beginning,	 αυτοί	 πότε	 φτάνουν;	 [aftí	 póte	
    ftánun?].	You	remember	the	word	for,	world?	Like	in	cosmopolitan,	a	worldly	city.		
	
S:	 Κόσμος	[kósmos].		
	
T:	 Κόσμος	[kózmos].	So	if	you	wanted	to	say,	worlds?		
	
S:	 Κόσμοι	[kózmi].		
	
T:	 Κόσμοι.	Good.	Maybe	you	would	use	that	speaking	metaphorically.	The	word	for	
    “other”	–	other	or	another,	was	άλλο	[álo]	for	neuter.		
	
S:	 Άλλο.		
	
T:	 Άλλο,	good.	How	would	you	say,	other	worlds?		
	
S:	 Άλλοι	κόσμοι	[áli	kózmi].		
	
T:	 Άλλοι	κόσμοι,	good.	So	the	masculine	plural	sounds	like	the	feminine,	although	it	
    looks	 different.	 So	 αυτός	 [aftós]	 becomes	 αυτοί	 [aftí].	 And	 this	 connection	
    between	feminine	and	plural	is	seen	in	many	languages,	which	is	quite	interesting.	
    In	 German	 you	 have,	 for	 example,	 sie	 [zi]	 for	 “they”	 and	 sie	 for	 “she”.	 In	 Arabic	
    you	have	plural	objects	behaving	like	“she”.	So	in	different	languages	you	find	this	
    connection	between	plural	and	feminine.	I	don’t	know	why	it	is;	there	are	various	
    ideas	 about	 it.	 Maybe	 it’s	 because	 women	 create	 more	 people.	 Women	 are	 the	
    only	 people	 that	 create	 more	 people.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 He	 wants,	 and	 we’re	
    stressing	the	word	for	he?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	θέλει	[aftós	théli].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	θέλει.	And,	They	want,	stressing	the	word	for,	they?		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	θέλουν	[aftí	thélun].		
	
T:	 Αυτοί	θέλουν,	good.	And,	She	wants?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	θέλο	…	αυτή	θέλει	[aftí	théli].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	θέλει.	Very	good.	And,	They	want,	talking	about	females?		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	θέλουν	[aftí	thélun].		
	
T:	 That	 would	 be	 masculine	 or	 a	 mix,	 but	 we	 want	 the	 feminine.	 How	 is	 the	
    feminine?		


                                                                                                152
	
S:	 Αυτές	θέλουν	[aftés	thélun].		
	
T:	 Αυτές	 θέλουν.	 Very	 good.	 So	 we’ve	 seen	 now	 the	 main	 plural	 pattern	 for	
    masculine,	 feminine,	 and	 neuter.	 We’ve	 seen	 αυτή	 [aftí]	 to	 αυτές	 [aftés]	 for	
    feminine,	αυτός	[aftós]	to	αυτοί	[aftí]	for	masculine,	and	for	neuter,	we	also	saw	
    the	plural,	αυτό	[aftó]	to	…	?		
	
S:	 Αυτά	[aftá].		
	
T:	 Αυτά.	 So	 we	 have	 αυτό	 to	 αυτά,	 like	 βιβλίο	 [vivlío],	 βιβλία	 [vivlía]	 –	 the	 books;	
    παιδί	[pedhí],	παιδιά	[pedhiá]	–	the	children.	House?	How	might	that	become?		
	
S:	 Σπίτι	[spíti].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	how	do	you	think	you	would	make	it	plural,	as	it’s,	το	σπίτι	[to	spíti].		
	
S:	 Τα	σπίτια	[ta	spítia].		
	
T:	 Τα	σπίτια,	very	good.

Teacher:	The	verb,	“I	lose”,	or	“I’m	losing”,	is	χάνω	[kháno].	Χάνω.		
	
Student:	Χάνω.		
	
T:	 So	 that’s	 spelt	with	 the	 letter	 that	 looks	 like	 an	 X	(χ),	and	 you	 should	 be	 careful	
    there,	 because	 the	 K	 can	 look	 a	 little	 bit	 like	 an	 X	 in	 Greek.	 This	 X	 kind	 of	 really	
    hangs	 below	 the	 line.	 XAV	 (which	 gives	 us	 the	 N	 sound),	 and	 then	 the	 W	 (ω,	
    ωμέγα	[omégha]),	that	gives	us	the	O.	Xάνω,	I	lose,	I’m	losing.	What	do	you	think	
    the	closed	version	of	χάνω	might	be?		
	
S:	 Χάσω	[kháso]?		
	
T:	 Χάσω,	χάσω,	good.	How	would	you	say,	I	will	lose	it?		
	
S:	 Θα	χάσω	…	θα	το	χάσω	[tha	to	kháso].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	χάσω,	good.	And,	I	will	lose	them?		
	
S:	 Θα	τα	χάσω	[tha	ta	kháso].		
	
T:	 Θα	τα	χάσω.	And	this	is	them,	only	for	neuter	objects	or	for	children,	no?	We	saw	
    that,	 παιδί,	 παιδιά	 [pedhí,	 pedhiá]	 is	 neuter	 so,	 τα	 χάσω,	 it	 could	 refer	 to,	 The	
    children,	I	will	lose	them.	What	was,	I	have?		
	
S:	 Έχω	[ékho].		
	
T:	 Έχω	[ékho].	He	has,	she	has,	it	has?		
	
S:	 Έχει	[échi].		
	
T:	 Έχει	[échi].	So	here	we	see	that	the	Χ/χ	[ch]	is	a	little	softer	–	έχει	–	because	it’s	
    followed	 by	 an	 [i]	 sound	 that	 softens	 it.	 We’re	 going	 to	 see	 that	 of	 a	 couple	 of	
    others	letters	in	Greek	too:	έχω	[ékho],	it’s	harder	there	than	έχει	[échi],	a	little	
    softer.	You	have?		
	
S:	 Έχεις	[échis].		
	
T:	 Έχεις,	good.	We	have?		
	
S:	 Έχουμε	[ékhume].		
	
T:	 Yeah,	 and	 there	 it’s	 more	 brutal	 again,	 no?	 Έχουμε,	 έχουμε,	 more	 friction.	 They

                                                                                                     154
	
T:	 Έχουν,	 good.	 Now	 what	 if	 you	 wanted	 to	 stress	 the	 word	 for	 they,	 and	 you’re	
    referring	to	a	masculine	group	or	a	mixed	group.	They	have?		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	έχουν	[aftí	ékhun].

S:	 Αυτές	έχουν	[aftés	ékhun].		
	
T:	 Αυτές	έχουν,	good.	So	something	that’s	really	cool	that	we	can	do	with	what	we	
    know	already	–	we	don’t	need	to	learn	anything	new	–	is	to	talk	about	the	past	in	
    Greek.	 Now	 we	 have	 a	 few	 ways	 to	 talk	 about	 the	 past,	 both	 in	 Greek	 and	 in	
    English.	 Compare,	 I	lost	 it,	 I	 have	lost	 it,	and	 I	was	losing	 it.	 Now	we’re	going	to	
    learn,	 with	 what	 we	 know	 already,	 how	 to	 build,	 I	 have	 lost	 it.	 The	 first	 bit	 is,	 I	
    have.		
	
S:	 Έχω	[ékho].		
	
T:	 Έχω.	Now	to	get	the	“have”	past,	the	have	past	of	lost,	no,	I	have	lost	it	…	To	build	
    this,	we	start	with	the	closed	version	of	the	verb,	χάσω	[kháso].		
	
S:	 Χάσω.		
	
T:	 And	then	we	go	into	the	“he,	she,	it”	form.	We	take	off	the	[o]	(ω),	and	we	add	an	
    [i]	sound	or	an	EI	(ει),	in	writing.	And	we	get	…	how	would	that	sound?		
	
S:	 Χάσει	[khási].		
	
T:	 Χάσει.	Sο	Έχω	χάσει	[ékho	khási]	is,	“I	have	lost”.	So	χάσει	[khási]	is	always	χάσει.	
    It	has	nothing	to	do	with	“he,	she,	it”	here.	This	is	just	the	form	that	we	use	to	get	
    that	“have”	past.	So,	Έχω	χάσει,	is	“I	have	lost”.	If	you	want	to	say,	I	have	lost	it	…	
    and	the	it,	we	must	have	it	up	front.	So	we	have	the	it	first:	It	I	have	lost.		
	
S:	 Το	έχω	χάσει	[to	ékho	khási].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	έχω	χάσει.	I	haven’t	lost	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	έχω	χάσει	[dhen	to	ékho	khási].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Δεν	 το	 έχω	 χάσει.	 Very	 good.	 So	 you	 never	 have	 to	 think	 about	 open	 or	
    closed	here	in	this	“have”	past.	It’s	always	just,	χάσει.	We	have	lost?		
	
S:	 Έχουμε	χάσει	[ékhume	khási].		
	
T:	 Έχουμε	χάσει,	έχουμε	χάσει.	He	has	lost,	she	has	lost?

S:	 Έχει	χάσει	[échi	khási].		
	
T:	 Good.	They	haven’t	lost	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	έχουν	χάσει	[dhen	ékhun	khási].		
	
T:	 Good.	And	the	“it”?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	έχουν	χάσει	[dhen	to	ékhun	khási].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	το	έχουν	χάσει.	They	haven’t	lost	it,	very	good.	“I	forget”,	in	Greek,	
    I	forget,	is	ξεχνάω	[ksekhnáo].	Ξεχνάω.		
	
S:	 Ξεχνάω.		
	
T:	 And	a	difficult	one,	we	have	to	think	our	way	through,	no?	So	the	first	sound	is	KS,	
    [ks].		
	
S:	 [ks].		
	
T:	 There	 that’s	 one	 letter	 in	 Greek.	 That’s	 the	 letter	 that	 looks	 like	 a	 kind	 of	 curvy	
    capital	E	with	a	little	tail	(Ξ/ξ).	Something	like	that.	So	that’s	the	first	part,	ξε	[kse],	
    the	[ks]	with	an	E,	ξε.		
	
S:	 Ξε	[kse].		
	
T:	 Ξεχνάω	[ksekhnáo].		
	
S:	 Ξεχνάω.		
	
T:	 Ξεχνάω.	So	if	you	wanted	to	say,	She	is	forgetting?		
	
S:	 Ξεχνάει	[ksekhnái].		
	
T:	 Ξεχνάει,	ξεχνάει.	She’s	forgetting	me,	she	forgets	me?		
	
S:	 Με	ξεχνάει	[me	ksekhnái].		
	
T:	 Με	ξεχνάει,	good.	I	mentioned	briefly	that	“him”	was	τον	[ton]	and	“her”	was	την	
    [tin].	So	we	have	τον	and	την	for	him	and	her.	So	if	you	wanted	to	say	something	
    like,	She’s	forgetting	him	...	So,	She’s	forgetting?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	ξεχνάει	[aftí	ksekhnái].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	we	don’t	need	αυτή	but	we	can	put	it.	Ξεχνάει,	αυτή	ξεχνάει.	And	now,	
    She’s	forgetting	him.		
	


                                                                                                 156
S:	 Αυτή	τον	ξεχνάει	[aftí	ton	ksekhnái].		
	
T:	 Good.	Τον	ξεχνάει	[ton	ksekhnái],	or,	αυτή	τον	ξεχνάει.	How	would	you	say,	She’s	
    forgetting	her?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	την	ξεχνάει	[aftí	tin	ksekhnái].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτή	την	ξεχνάει,	or	just,	την	ξεχνάει	[tin	ksekhnái].	What	was	again,	I	
    lose?		
	
S:	 Χάνω	[kháno].		
	
T:	 Χάνω,	χάνω.	And,	I	forget?		
	
S:	 Ξεχνάω	[ksekhnáo].		
	
T:	 Ξεχνάω,	good.	So	actually	these	two	words,	these	two	verbs,	are	related.	It’s	not	
    very	obvious	from	χάνω,	ξεχνάω	[kháno,	ksekhnáo],	but	it’s	very	obvious	from	the	
    closed	forms	of	the	verbs.	We’ve	seen	that	χάνω	becomes	χάσω	[kháso].	Ξεχνάω	
    becomes	ξεχάσω	[ksekháso],	and	we	can	feel	the	connection	in	the	meaning,	no?	
    When	you	forget	something,	you	lose	it,	no?	So	you	have	χάνω,	I	lose,	and	then	
    ξεχνάω,	 I	 forget.	 But	 the	 closed	 forms	 of	 those	 verbs	 are	 χάσω	 [kháso]	 and	
    ξεχάσω	[ksekháso].	So	how	would	you	say,	I	have	forgotten?		
	
S:	 Έχω	χάσω	…	χάσει	…	έχω	χάσει	[ékho	khási].		
	
T:	 That	would	be,	I	have	lost,	no?	But	it’s	a	very	small	step	from	there.		
	
S:	 Yeah.	Έχω	ξεχάσει	[ékho	ksekhási].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	ξεχάσει.	I	haven’t	forgotten?		
	
S:	 Δεν	έχω	ξεχάσει	[dhen	ékho	ksekhási].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	έχω	ξεχάσει.	I	haven’t	forgotten	him?		
	
S:	 Δεν	τον	έχω	ξεχάσει	[dhen	ton	ékho	ksekhási].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	τον	έχω	ξεχάσει.	He	–	and	we’ll	use	the	word	for	he	–	He	hasn’t	
    forgotten	her?	He	hasn’t	forgotten	her?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	δεν	την	έχει	ξεχάσει	[aftós	dhen	tin	ékhi	ksekhási].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτός	δεν	την	έχει	ξεχάσει.	The	word	for	“shop”,	in	Greek,	is	μαγαζί	
    [maghazí],	 or,	 το	 μαγαζί	 [to	 maghazí].	 Like	 I	 said,	 like	 I	 mentioned	 briefly,	 you	
    want	to	learn	your	nouns	with	the	word	for	“the”,	so	you	can	interiorise	when	you	
    come	across	it,	what	gender	it	is.	So,	το	μαγαζί,	“the	shop”.		


                                                                                              157
	
S:	 Το	μαγαζί.		
	
T:	 How	do	you	think	you	would	say,	The	shops?		
	
S:	 Τα	μαγαζιά	[ta	maghaziá].		
	
T:	 Good.	Τα	μαγαζιά.	So,	if	we	have	an	O	we	change	it	to	an	A	to	get	our	plural	for	
    neuter	nouns.	But	if	we	don’t,	we	just	stick	an	A	on	the	end,	no?	Μαγαζί,	μαγαζιά	
    [maghazí,	 maghaziá].	 The	 verb	 for,	 “I	 close”,	 or	 “I’m	 closing”,	 is	 κλείνω	 [klíno].	
    Κλείνω.		
	
S:	 Κλείνω.		
	
T:	 How	do	you	think	the	closed	version	of	that	might	be?		
	
S:	 Κλείσω	[klíso]?		
	
T:	 Κλείσω,	good.	The	closed	version	of,	to	close,	κλείσω.	So,	if	you	want	to	say,	The	
    shops	have	closed	–	let’s	go	through	that	bit	by	bit.	The	shops	is	the	first	bit.		
	
S:	 Τα	μαγαζιά.		
	
T:	 Τα	μαγαζιά.	Have	…	?		
	
S:	 Έχουν	[ékhun].		
	
T:	 Έχουν,	good.	The	shops	is	they.	Τα	μαγαζιά	έχουν	[ta	maghaziá	ékhun]	…	closed?		
	
S:	 Κλείσει	[klísi].		
	
T:	 Κλείσει,	very	good.	Τα	μαγαζιά	έχουν	κλείσει	[ta	maghaziá	ékhun	klísi].	You	cοuld	
    also	say	something	like,	The	shops	will	have	closed.	Now	when	we	say	that	out	of	
    context,	 it’s	 a	 bit	 difficult	 to	 understand	 what	 we	 mean	 when	 we	 say	 that	 in	
    English.	But	if	I	give	you	the	context,	it’s	clear.	You	know,	you’re	about	to	go	out	
    to	 buy	 something,	 and	 I	 tell	 you	 the	 shops	 will	 have	 closed.	 In	 English	 I	 can	 use	
    that	to	show	something	like	a	probability	–	they	will	have	closed	by	this	time,	no?	
    We	can	do	exactly	the	same	thing	in	Greek.	So	how	would	you	say	that?	The	shops	
    will	have	closed?		
	
S:	 	Τα	μαγαζιά	θα	έχουν	κλείσει	[ta	maghaziá	tha	ékhun	klísi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τα	μαγαζιά	θα	έχουν	κλείσει,	no?	The	shops	will	have	closed.

Teacher:	We	saw	that,	αρχή	[archí],	αρχή,	was	“start”,	or	“the	start”,	η	αρχή	[i	archí].	
    And	 we	 had,	 υπάρχει	 [ipárchi],	 built	 of	 υπο	 [ipo]	 and	 αρχή,	 so	 like	 the	 “under-
    start”,	meaning	“there	is”.	Υπάρχει.		
	
Student:	Υπάρχει.		
	
T:	 So,	υπάρχει,	there	is,	is	it	exists.	Υπάρχει.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	There	are,	instead	
    of	there	is,	you	would	say,	They	exist.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Υπάρχουν	[ipárkhun].		
	
T:	 Υπάρχουν.	 Very	 good.	 So	 you	 could	 say,	 for	 example,	 There	 are	 two	 –	 two	 was

S:	 Υπάρχουν	δύο	[ipárkhun	dhío].		
	
T:	 Υπάρχουν	δύο.	Good.	And,	There	is	one?	The	word	for	“one”	is	the	same	as	the

S:	 Υπάρχει	ένα	[ipárchi	éna].		
	
Τ:	 Ένα,	if	you	mean	a	neuter	thing	…	or	what	else	could	that	be?	What	if	you	meant	a	
    masculine	thing?		
	
S:	 Ένας.	Υπάρχει	ένας	[ipárchi	énas].		
	
T:	 Ένας.	Or	a	feminine	thing?	Do	you	remember	the	feminine	word	for	“a”?		
	
S:	 Μία	[mía].		
	
T:	 Μία.	So	that’s	also	“one”,	no?	All	of	that	is	also	“one”.	Υπάρχει	ένα,	υπάρχει	ένας,

S:	 Υπάρχουν	δύο	[ipárkhun	dhío].		
	
T:	 Υπάρχουν	 δύο.	 And	 then	 we	 had,	 αρχίζω	 [archízo],	 no?	 So,	 αρχή	 –	 “start”,	 and	
    “the	start”,	η	αρχή	[i	archí],	and	then,	αρχίζω,	“I	start”,	the	verb.	Αρχίζω.

S:	 Έχω	αρχίσει	[ékho	archísi].		
	
T:	 Έχω	αρχίσει,	very	good.	So	we	start	with,	“I	have”,	έχω	[ékho],	and	then	we	need	
    to	find	“started”,	no?	So	we	go	to	our	closed	version	of	the	verb	and	we	use	the	
    he/she/it	 form.	 Αρχίζω,	 αρχίσω,	 αρχίσει	 [archízo,	 archíso,	 archísi].	 Η	 ταινία	 [i	
    tenía],	η	ταινία,	is	“the	movie”.	Η	ταινία.

T:	 So	what	gender	is	ταινία?

S:	 Η	ταινία	έχει	αρχίσει	[i	tenía	échi	archísi].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Η	 ταινία	 έχει	 αρχίσει.	 Very	 good.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 The	 movies	 have	
    started?	So,	η	ταινία	is	the	movie.	How	do	you	think	you	would	get,	the	movies?	
    You	 could	 look	 back	 to	 another	 feminine	 word	 that	 goes	 into	 plural	 to	 remind

S:	 Αυτές	[aftés].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	there	you	have	the	main	plural	pattern	for	feminine	nouns.		
	
S:	 Yes.	Οι	ταινίες	[i	teníes].		
		
T:	 Οι	ταινίες.	Very	good.	So	how	would	you	say,	The	movies	have	started?		
	
S:	 Οι	ταινίες		…	Οι	ταινίες	έχουν	αρχίσει	[i	teníes	ékhun	archísi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Οι	ταινίες	έχουν	αρχίσει.	With	an	S.	Αρχίσει,	good.	So	actually	in	this	
    “have”	 past,	 we	 don’t	 need	 to	 think	 about	 the	 open	 and	 closed	 version	 of	 the	
    verb.	We	are	just	building	it	from	the	closed	version	always,	no?	And	this	“have”	
    past	 kind	 of	 by	 definition	 is	 closed	 in	 feeling,	 no?	 It	 has	 started.	 That’s	 always	 a	
    closed	feeling.	So	we	don’t	have	to	think	about	that;	that’s	just	how	we	build	this	
    “have”	past.	We	start	with	the	closed	version,	αρχίσω,	and	we	find	the	he/she/it	
    version,	αρχίσει.	“I	finish”,	or	“I’m	finishing”,	was	τελειώνω	[telióno].	Τελειώνω.

S:	 Τελει	…	τελειώσω	[telióso].		
	
T:	 Bravo!	There	you	found	it,	uh?	Because	you	can	just	run	through	the	options	and	
    the	one	that	you	used	before	is	going	to	just	sound	right.	So	you	can	run	through	
    τελειώψω,	 τελειώξω,	 τελειώσω	 [teliópso,	 teliókso,	 telióso].	 And	 then	 you’ll	
    remember:	 Oh	 yes,	 it	 was	 τελειώσω.	 Τελειώσω,	 very	 good.	 So	 you	 can	 say,	 The

Teacher:	Sometimes	the	difference	between	the	open,	the	standard,	and	the	closed,	
    the	alternative	version	of	the	verb	is	totally	random	–	totally	random.	And	this	is	
    because	 actually,	 historically,	 the	 two	 versions	 have	 often	 come	 from	 different	
    verbs.	But	now	they	came	together	to	form	one	verb.	Now	that	might	sound	really	
    strange,	 but	 it	 actually	 even	 happens	 in	 English.	 You	 have	 “I	 go”,	 and	 then	 “I	
    went”.	Went	is	not	the	past	of	go,	in	the	literal	sense	of	that	verb.	Went	comes	
    from	a	different	verb.	Went	comes	from	the	old	verb,	to	wend.	But	now	go	and	
    went,	 they	 got	 married,	 they	 came	 together	 to	 form	 the	 full	 set,	 no?	 Otherwise	
    we’d	have	something	like	“goed”,	no?	So	that	happens	in	English	as	well.	So	we’ll	
    find	 this	 in	 Greek.	 For	 example,	 “I	 see”,	 or	 “I’m	 seeing”,	 was	 βλέπω	 [vlépo].	
    Bλέπω.		
	
Student:	Βλέπω.		
	
T:	 Good.	 Now	 the	 closed	 version	 of	 βλέπω	 is	 δω	 [dho].	 Δω.	 That’s	 δέλτα	 (Δ/δ)	
    [dhélta],	and	the	ωμέγα	(Ω/ω)	[omégha]	giving	us	the	O	[o]	sound.	Δω.		
	
S:	 Δω.		
	
T:	 This	 might	 be	 connected	 to	 θωρώ	 [thoró],	 which	 is	 how	 we	 say,	 “I	 see”,	 “I’m	
    seeing”,	 in	 Cyprus.	 It’s	 an	 alternative,	 ancient	 form.	 I	 don’t	 know	 if	 that’s	
    connected,	but	they	are	clearly	from	different	verbs.	Βλέπω,	“I	see”,	“I’m	seeing”,	
    in	standard	Greek,	and	δω,	the	closed	version.	How	would	you	say,	We’ll	see,	We	
    will	see?		
	
S:	 Θα	δούμε	[tha	dhúme].

    because	you	know	that	the	movie	is,	η	ταινία,	that	it’s	feminine	–	there	you	will	
    say,	Have	you	seen	her,	referring	to	the	movie.	So	this	her	can	also	be	feminine	it.	
    So	how	would	you	say	that,	Have	you	seen	it?	–	and	you	mean,	the	movie?		
	
S:	 Την	έχεις	δει;	[tin	échis	dhi?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Την	έχεις	δει;	Have	you	seen	it?	Feminine	it.	So	for,	I	see,	we	have,	βλέπω	
    and	δω.	Very	different.	“I	eat”,	or	“I’m	eating”,	is	τρώω	[tróo].	Τρώω.		
	
S:	 Τρώω.		
	
T:	 Eh,	 we	 have	 “trophic”	 in	 English,	 no,	 like	 the	 trophic	 levels	 of	 a	 food	 chain.	 So	
    that’s	 related.	 Of	 course	 we	 have	 PH	 in	 trophic,	 suggesting	 to	 us	 that	 it’s	 from	
    Greek.	Τρώω.	“You	eat”,	is	τρως	[tros].	That’s	a	little	bit	weird.	We	have	the	S	for	
    you,	but	it’s	not	the	[is]	(εις),	like	in	θέλεις	[thélis],	no?	Τρως.		
	
S:	 Τρως.		
	
T:	 What	are	you	eating?		
	
S:	 Τι	τρως;	[ti	tros?].		
	
T:	 Τι	τρως;	“We	eat”	is	weird	in	the	same	way.	We	have	τρώμε	[tróme],	rather	than	
    τρούμε	[trúme].	Τρώμε.		
	


                                                                                                163
S:	 Τρώμε	[tróme].		
	
T:	 We	eat.	How	do	you	think,	They	eat,	might	be?		
	
S:	 Τρων	[trón].		
	
T:	 Actually	it	will	be	strange	to	hear,	τρων.	It	sounds	a	little	bit	weird.	In	this	case	we	
    will	have,	τρώνε	[tróne].		
	
S:	 Τρώνε.		
	
T:	 Good.	The	closed	version	of	τρώω,	the	closed	version	of	τρώω	is,	φάω	[fáo].	Φάω.		
	
S:	 Φάω.		
	
T:	 Which	is	maybe	where	the	PH	of	trophic	comes,	no?	In	trophic	we	have	both.	We	
    have	 τρωω	 and	 then	 [f]	 giving	 us	 the	 F	 in	 Greek,	 so	 that’s	 easy	 to	 remember.	
    Τρώω,	 φάω.	 Trophic.	 So,	 φάω	 is	 the	 closed	 version	 of	 τρώω.	 So	 if,	 for	 example,	
    you	want	to	say,	I	don’t	want	to	eat?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	φάω	[dhen	thélo	na	fáo].		
	
T:	 Good.	Δεν	θέλω	να	φάω.	F-A-O.	Φάω.	Δεν	θέλω	να	φάω.	And	of	course	this	would	
    mean,	I	don’t	want	to	eat,	like	now,	or	a	specific	instance.	It’s	a	closed	period.	But	
    if	you	meant	generally,	like,	I	don’t	want	to	eat	(unhealthy	things),	you	would	say	
    δεν	 θέλω	 να	 τρώω	 [dhen	 thélo	 na	 tróo].	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 What	 shall	 I	 eat?	
    What	shall	I	eat?	How	do	we	get	that	feeling?		
	
S:	 Τι	θα	φάω;	[ti	tha	fáo?].		
	
T:	 Τι	θα	φάω	would	be,	What	will	I	eat.	And	I	guess	you	could	use	it	like	that.	Τι	θα	
    φάω;	What	will	I	eat,	no,	as	a	suggestion.	But	to	make	it	much	clearer	that	you’re	
    saying	something	like	“shall”:	What	shall	I	eat.	So	first	is,	What.		
	
S:	 Τι	...		
	
T:	 And	then	it’s,	Shall	I	eat.		
	
S:	 …	να	φάω;	[na	fáo?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Τι	να	φάω;	[ti	na	fáo?].	Τι	να	φάω;		
	
S:	 Τι	να	φάω;		
	
T:	 What	shall	I	eat?	Very	good.	What	shall	we	eat?		
	
S:	 Τι	να	φάμε;	[ti	na	fáme?].		


                                                                                            164
	
T:	 Τι	να	φάμε;	And	we	can	change	the	tone	of	voice	to	say,	We	should	eat.		
	
S:	 Να	φάμε	[na	fáme].		
	
T:	 Να	φάμε.	Good.	And	you	can	also	say,	Ας	φάμε	[as	fáme],	ας	φάμε,	in	Greek.	This	
    ας	[as]	is	like	“let’s”	as	well.	Ας	φάμε,	let’s	eat.		
	
	 “Come”,	like	the	order,	“Come!”,	in	Greek,	is	έλα	[éla].	Έλα.		
	
S:	 Έλα.		
	
T:	 Έλα.	How	would	you	say,	Come	to	eat?	How	do	you	think	you	would	build	that?		
	
S:	 Έλα	να	φας	[éla	na	fas].		
	
T:	 Very	good!	Έλα	να	φας.	Έλα	να	φας.	How	would	you	say,	Come	and	see,	Come	to	
    see?		
	
S:	 Έλα	να	…	έλα	να	δεις	[éla	na	dhis].		
	
T:	 Good.	Έλα	να	δεις.	Έλα	να	δεις.	Come	see.	Come	see	it?		
	
S:	 Έλα	να	το	δεις	[éla	na	to	dhis].		
	
T:	 Έλα	να	το	δεις.	Very	good.	Come	and	see	us,	like,	Come	and	visit	us,	Come	and	see	
    us?		
	
S:	 Έλα	να	μας	δεις	[éla	na	mas	dhis].		
	
T:	 Good.	Έλα	να	μας	δεις.	Very	good.

Teacher:	How	was,	my	friend?	My	friend.	The	word	for	friend,	we	can	relate	it	to,	like,	
    “philos”	 in	 philosophy,	 which	 means	 the	 love	 of	 wisdom.	 How	 is,	 my	 friend,	 the	
    friend	my?		
	
Student:	Ο	φίλος	μου	[o	fílos	mu].		
	
T:	 Ο	 φίλος	 μου.	 Very	 good.	 And,	 my	 friends?	 Imagine	 we	 have	 a	 masculine	 or	 a	
    mixed	group?	My	friends.		
	
S:	 Οι	φίλοι	μου	[i	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Οι	φίλοι	μου.	Very	good.	And,	My	friend,	talking	about	a	female?		
	
S:	 Η	φίλη	μου	[i	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Η	φίλη	μου.	The	same,	no?	But	written	differently,	but	to	the	ear,	it’s	the	same.	
    How	would	you	say,	She	is	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	η	φίλη	μου	[aftí	íne	i	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	 είναι	 η	 φίλη	 μου.	 And	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 They	 are	 my	 friends?	 Again	
    talking	about	mixed	or	masculine.		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	είναι	οι	φίλοι	μου	[aftí	íne	i	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Exactly	the	same!	Αυτοί	είναι	οι	φίλοι	μου.	Because	είναι	[íne]	can	be,	he/she/it	
    is,	 or	 they	 are,	 no?	 So	 here	 we	 will	 understand	 by	 the	 context,	 but	 there’s	
    definitely	some	room	for	confusion,	no?	But	if	you	were	to	say,	feminine	friends,	
    no?	My	friends,	and	you	mean	feminine	friends,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Οι	φίλες	μου	[i	fíles	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Οι	 φίλες	 μου.	 My	 friends,	 feminine.	 Οι	 φίλες	 μου.	 And,	 your	 friends,	
    feminine?		
	
S:	 Οι	φίλες	σου	[i	fíles	su].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Οι	 φίλες	 σου.	 Very	 good.	 Your	 friends,	 your	 female	 friends.	 So	 μου	 [mu],	
    what	 we	 use	 for	 my,	 is	 actually	 “to	 me”.	 And	 σου	 [su],	 what	 we	 use	 for	 your,	 is	
    actually	 something	 like	 “to	 you”.	 And	 other	 languages	 deal	 with	 possession	 in	 a	
    similar	way:	Turkish,	Arabic,	for	example.	In	Arabic	–	or	Egyptian	Arabic	at	least	–	
    you	know	if	you	want	to	say,	“I	have	a	house”,	you	would	say	“andi	bet”	(at	me	
    house),	no?	And	we	did	something	very	similar	when	we	say,	ο	φίλος	μου	[o	fílos	
    mu]:	 the	 friend	 to	 me.	 So	 μου	 is	 “to	 me”,	 and	 σου	 is	 “to	 you”.	 And	 you	 will	 use	
    these	 words	 when	 you	 mean,	 to	 me,	 instead	 of,	 me.	 So,	 for	 example,	 if	 you	 say	


                                                                                                166
   He’s	telling	me,	what	we	mean	there	is,	to	me.	So	we	won’t	use	με	[me],	we	will	
   use	 μου	 [mu].	 So	 let’s	 practice	 that.	 “I	 say”,	 or	 “I	 tell”,	 or	 “I’m	 saying”,	 “I’m	
   telling”,	is	λέω	[léo].	Λέω.		
	
S:	 Λέω.		
	
T:	 As	if	it	were	LEO	(Λ-Ε-Ω).	Λέω.		
	
S:	 Λέω.		
	
T:	 “You	say”,	is	λες	[les].	Λες.	So	it’s	a	little	bit	irregular,	like	τρώω,	τρως	[tróo,	tros].	
    Λέω,	λες	[léo,	les].		
	
S:	 Λες.		
	
T:	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 What	 do	 you	 say?	 What	 do	 you	 say?	 And	 you	 can	 use	 this	
    like,	What	do	you	think?	What	do	you	say,	what	do	you	think?		
	
S:	 Τι	λες;	[ti	les?].		
	
T:	 Τι	λες;	Good.	Now	you	can	also	say,	What	are	you	saying	to	me?	–	which	you	can	
    use	 like,	 What	 are	 you	 on	 about,	 what	 are	 you	 talking	 about?	 So	 here	 we	 don’t	
    need	με	[me],	me,	we	need,	to	me.	What	is,	to	me?		
	
S:	 Μου	[mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	What	are	you	telling	me?		
	
S:	 Τι	μου	λες;	[ti	mu	les?].		
	
T:	 Τι	 μου	 λες;	 What	 are	 you	 talking	 about?	 What	 are	 you	 on	 about?	 Τι	 μου	 λες;	
    Good.	 So	 that	 sounds	 quite	 different	 to,	 τι	 λες;	 [ti	 les?],	 which	 is,	 What	 do	 you	
    think?	Like,	we	want	to	go	to	the	cinema	–	What	do	you	think?	Τι	λες;	And,	τι	μου	
    λες;	What	are	you	on	about?	“We	say”,	or	“We	tell”	is,	λέμε	[léme].	Λέμε.		
	
S:	 Λέμε.		
	
T:	 So	we	see	again	like	the	S	for	you	in	λες,	and	the	M	for	we	in	λεμε,	but	they	are	a	
    little	 bit	 irregular,	 no?	 We	 don’t	 have	 λούμε	 [lúme],	 we	 have	 λέμε.	 How	 would	
    you	say,	We	say	them,	and	that	them	is	neuter	plural.	I	know	it	sounds	weird	in	
    English,	but	it	means	something	in	Greek.	We	say	them,	how	is	that?		
	
S:	 Τα	λέμε	[ta	léme].		
	
T:	 Τα	 λέμε.	 And	 this	 is	 used	 like,	 ciao	 in	 Greek.	 Τα	 λέμε,	 τα	 λέμε.	 We	 say	 them	 –	
    those	neuter	things.	Like,	We	catch	up.	Like,	We’ll	catch	up.	Τα	λέμε.		
	


                                                                                                167
S:	 Τα	λέμε.		
	
T:	 And	 how	 do	 you	 think,	 They	 say,	 they	 tell,	 might	 be?	 Λέω,	 λες,	 λέμε	 [léo,	 les,	
    léme]	...	If	you	continue	that	pattern,	how	might	it	be,	They	say,	they	tell?		
	
S:	 Λένε	[léne].		
	
T:	 Λένε,	good!	Very	good.	Λένε.	So	when	you	find	one	version	of	a	verb	that	is	not	as	
    you	expect	it	to	be,	you	can	still	use	that	to	guess	how	the	other	versions	might	
    be,	because	we	will	find	patterns	within	that,	as	we’ve	seen:	τρώω,	τρως,	τρώμε,	
    τρώνε	 [tróo,	 tros,	 tróme,	 tróne].	 Λέω,	 λες,	 λέμε,	 λένε	 [léo,	 les,	 léme,	 léne].	 The	
    word	for	“how”,	in	Greek,	how,	is	πώς	[pos].	Πώς.		
	
S:	 Πώς.	
	
T:	 If	you	say,	How	do	they	say	you?	So,	How	do	they	say	you?	That	means,	How	do	
    they	call	you,	what	are	you	called?	What’s	your	name?	So	how	would	you	say	that,	
    What’s	 your	 name?	 Or,	 How	 do	 they	 say	 you?	 And	 what	 you	 do	 you	 think	 you	
    would	use?		
	
S:	 Πώς	σε	λένε;	[pos	se	léne?].		
	
T:	 Πώς	 σε	 λένε;	 And	 you	 used	 σε	 here,	 because	 it’s,	 How	 do	 they	 say	 you?	 rather	
    than,	How	do	they	say	to	you,	no?	It’s,	How	do	they	call	you?	So	it’s,	σε	[se]	rather	
    than	σου	[su].	But	what	if	you	wanted	to	say,	What	are	they	saying	to	you?	What	
    are	they	saying	to	you?		
	
S:	 Πώς	…	τι	…	Τι	σου	λένε;	[ti	su	léne?].		
	
T:	 Τι	σου	λένε;	Good,	What	are	they	telling	you?	Τι	σου	λένε;	The	closed	version	of	
    λέω,	the	closed	version	of	λέω	is,	πω	[po].		
	
S:	 Πω.		
	
T:	 Πω.	P	–	ωμέγα	[omégha].	So	that	pi	(π)	and	ωμέγα.	Πω.		
	
S:	 Πω.		
	
T:	 So	like	βλέπω	[vlépo]	and	δω	[dho]	for,	I	see,	and	τρώω	[tróo]	and	φάω	[fáo]	for,	
    I’m	eating,	we	have	a	crazy	shift	there	from	λέω	[léo]	to	πω	[po].	How	would	you	
    say,	I	shall,	I	should,	you	know	that	feeling	starting	with	να,	tell	you?		
	
S:	 Να	σου	πω	[na	su	po].		
	
T:	 Να	σου	πω.	And	you	will	hear	this	very	often	in	Greek,	as	a	way	of	kind	of	opening	
    up	conversation	or	starting	a	sentence,	Να	σου	πω,	like,	Οh	I	wanted	to	tell	you	
    something,	you	know?	Να	σου	πω,	is	very,	very	common	in	Greek;	you	will	hear	


                                                                                               168
   that	around.	So	that	is	literally,	να	–	that	feeling	of	shall	–	to	you	I	tell.	Να	σου	πω.	
   What	should	I	tell	you?	What	shall	I	tell	you?		
	
S:	 Τι	να	σου	πω;	[ti	na	su	po?].		
	
T:	 Τι	να	σου	πω;	Τι	να	σου	πω;	Also	used	very	often	in	Greek	like,	you	know,	What	
    do	 you	 want	 me	 to	 say?	 Or,	 What	 do	 you	 want	 me	 to	 do?,	 even.	 Tι	 να	 σου	 πω;	
    What	do	you	want	me	to	say?	So	we	have	τι	for	what,	and	something	was,	κάτι	
    [káti],	κάτι.		
	
S:	 Κάτι.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	want	to	tell	you	something?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	σου	πω	κάτι	[thélo	na	su	po	káti].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλω	να	σου	πω	κάτι.	Good.	What	was,	I	can,	or	I’m	able	to?		
	
S:	 Μπορώ	[boró].		
	
T:	 Μπορώ.	How	would	you	say,	I	can’t	tell	you?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	σου	πω	[dhen	boró	na	su	po].		
	
T:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	σου	πω.	Very	good.	How	would	you	say,	I	can’t	see	you?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	σε	δω	[dhen	boró	na	se	dho].		
	
T:	 Very	good!	Δεν	μπορώ	να	σε	δω.	Very	good.	And	you	went	back	to,	σε	[se],	no?	
    Because	 it’s	 not,	 see	 to	 you,	 it’s	 see	 you.	 Δεν	 μπορώ	 να	 σε	 δω.	 What	 have	 you	
    said?	What	have	you	said?		
	
S:	 Τι	έχεις	πει;	[ti	échis	pi?].		
	
T:	 Τι	έχεις	πει;	
	
S:	 Τι	έχεις	πει;	
	
T:	 What	has	she	told	you?	What	has	she	said	to	you?		
	
S:	 Τι	σου	έχει	πει;	[ti	su	échi	pi?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τι	σου	έχει	πει;	So	again	we	don’t	want	to	work	too	much	with	direct	
    translations,	 no?	 Because	 we	 saw	 that	 in	 English,	 both	 translations	 are	 possible.	
    What	has	she	said	to	you?	(to	you),	and,	What	has	she	told	you?	So	what	we’re	
    looking	for	is	the	meaning.	If	what	we	mean	is,	to	you,	and	then	we	want	to	put	




                                                                                             169

Teacher:	Δίνω	[dhíno],	δίνω	is,	“I	give”,	or	“I’m	giving”.	Δίνω.

T:	 So	 we	 have	 the	 N	 to	 S	 shift,	 but	 we	 also	 have	 a	 vowel	 change,	 so	 that’s	 a	 bit

    in	English	we	have	those	two	ways	of	saying	it:	They	have	given	me	it;	They	have	
    given	it	to	me.	But	in	Greek,	it’s	going	to	be,	“me	it”,	but	μου	comes	first.	So	you	
    will	say,	“Me	it	they	have	given”.		
	
S:	 Μου	το	έχουν	δώσει	[mu	to	ékhun	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Good.	Μου	το	έχουν	δώσει.	They	have	given	me	it.	They	have	given	it	to	me.		
    We	have	given	you	it.	We	have	given	you	it.		
	
S:	 Σου	το	έχουμε	δώσει	[su	to	ékhume	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Σου	το	έχουμε	δώσει.	Very	good.	The	word	for	“already”,	already,	is	
    ήδη	[ídhi].	Ήδη.		
	
S:	 Ήδη.		
	
T:	 It’s	like	I	–	δέλτα	[dhélta]	–	I.	Ήδη.		
	
S:	 Ήδη.		
	


                                                                                               171
T:	 Good.	So	you	could	say,	We	have	given	you	it	already.		
	
S:	 Σου	το	έχουμε	δώσει	ήδη	[su	to	ékhume	dhósi	ídhi].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Σου	 το	 έχουμε	 δώσει	 ήδη,	 or,	 ήδη	 σου	 το	 έχουμε	 δώσει	 [ídhi	 su	 to	
    ékhume	 dhósi].	 Σου	 το	 [su	 to]	 can	 contract,	 it	 can	 stick	 together	 and	 build	 στο	
    [sto].		
	
S:	 Στο.		
	
T:	 Στο.	We	saw	another	example	of	this,	of	σε	το	[se	to].	But	in	this	case	it	was	“in	
    the”	like,	in	the	house.	Σε	το	σπιτι,	στο	σπιτι	[se	to	spíti,	sto	spíti].	And	in	this	case,	
    στο	σπιτι,	we	always	contract.	But	with	σου	το,	it’s	much	more	optional,	no?	But	
    you	 can	 contract	 that	 together	 to	 say,	 στο.	 So	 using	 that	 contraction,	 στο	 [sto],	
    how	would	you	say,	We	have	given	you	it	already?		
	
S:	 Ήδη	στο	έχουμε	δώσει	[ídhi	sto	ékhume	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Good.	Ήδη	στο	έχουμε	δώσει.	Or,	στο	έχουμε	δώσει	ήδη	[sto	ékhume	dhósi	ídhi].	
    Now,	if	you	wanted	to	say,	We	have	given	you	them	already.	We	have	given	you	
    them	already,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Στα	[sta].		
	
T:	 Very	good.		
	
S:	 Στα	έχουμε	δώσει	ήδη	[sta	ékhume	dhósi	ídhi].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Στα	 έχουμε	 δώσει	 ήδη,	 or,	 σου	 τα	 έχουμε	 δώσει	 ήδη	 [su	 ta	 ékhume	
    dhósi	ídhi].	But	very	good;	you	can	make	that	contraction	of,	σου	τα,	and	you	get	
    στα.	Στα	έχουμε	δώσει	ήδη.	How	would	you	say,	We	want	to	give	you	them?	We	
    want	to	give	you	them.		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	να	στα	έχουμε	δώσει	[thélume	na	sta	ékhume	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Ooh,	that	means,	We	want	to	have	given	you	…		
	
S:	 No,	 no	 sorry.	 Θέλουμε	 να	 στα	 δώσει	 ...	 δώσουμε	 [thélume	 na	 sta	 dhósi	 …	
    dhósume].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	So	we	just	had	to	let	go	of	that	“have”	past,	which	had	nothing	to	do	
    with	this,	no?	We	want	to	give	you	them.	Θέλουμε	να	στα	δώσουμε	[thélume	na	
    sta	dhósume].	Γράφω	[ghráfo],	γράφω,	was	…	?		
	
S:	 Write.		
	
T:	 Write.	I	write.	What	was	the	closed	version	of,	γράφω?		


                                                                                              172
	
S:	 Γράψω	[ghrápso].		
	
T:	 Γράψω.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	Have	you	written	to	me?	Have	you	written	to	
    me?		
	
S:	 Μου	έχεις	γράψει;	[mu	échis	ghrápsi?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μου	–	to	me	–	μου	έχεις	γράψει;	Very	good.	“Us”,	the	word	for	us,	is	
    μας	[mas].	Like	M-A-S,	μας.	So	kind	of	like	us	with	a	M,	but	M-A-S,	μας.		
	
S:	 Μας.		
	
T:	 Μας.	Μας	is	also	“to	us”,	so	μας	doesn’t	change.	It’s	always	μας,	so	we	don’t	have	
    the	situation	like	με/μου	[me/mu],	σε/σου	[se/su].	We	just	have	μας	and	μας.	So	
    how	would	you	say,	Have	you	written	to	us?		
	
S:	 Μας	έχεις	γράψει;	[mas	échis	ghrápsi?].		
	
T:	 Μας	έχεις	γράψει;	The	word	for	when	…	do	you	remember	the	word	for	when?		
	
S:	 Πότε	[póte].		
	
T:	 Πότε,	 good.	 So	 it	 starts	 with	 P.	 We	 saw	 that	 we	 had	 πού	 [pu]	 for	 where,	 begins	
    with	 P,	 πώς	 [pos]	 the	 word	 for	 how,	 also	 with	 P.	 Most	 of	 the	 question	 words	
    actually	in	Greek	do	begin	with	P.	That	can	help	us	remember	them.	Πότε,	when.	
    When	will	you	write	to	us.		
	
S:	 Πότε	θα	μας	γράψεις;	[póte	tha	mas	grápsis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	And	try	the	γράψεις	[ghrápsis]	a	bit	more	[gh].		
	
S:	 Πότε	θα	μας	γράψεις;	[póte	tha	mas	ghrápsis?].		
	
T:	 Much	better.	Πότε	θα	μας	γράψεις;	When	will	you	write	to	us?		
	
    When	will	you	see	us?		
	
S:	 Πότε	θα	μας	δεις;	[póte	tha	mas	dhis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	We	had	βλέπω	[vlépo]	and	δω	[dho],	good.	Πότε	θα	μας	δεις;	Very	good.		
    The	word	for	“if”,	was	like,	να,	backwards.	How	was	that?		
	
S:	 Αν	[an].		
	
T:	 Αν.	And	the	word	for	“tonight”,	was	απόψε	[apópse].		
	


                                                                                              173
S:	 Απόψε.		
	
T:	 Απόψε,	good.		
	
S:	 Απόψε.		
	
T:	 If	 you	 see	 him	 tonight,	 can	 you	 tell	 me?	 And	 in	 Greek,	 here	 it’s	 much	 more	
    common,	Can	you	tell	me	it,	because	we’re	referring	to	something	specific	there,	
    no?	If	you	see	him	tonight,	can	you	tell	me	it?	So	the	first	bit	is,	If	you	see	him.		
	
S:	 Αν	τον	βλέπεις	[an	ton	vlépis].		
	
T:	 Good,	 but	 after	 αν,	 no,	 we	 need	 to	 think	 about,	 do	 we	 want	 the	 open	 or	 the	
    closed	version?		
	
S:	 The	closed.		
	
T:	 So,	αν	τον	βλέπεις	would	mean,	If	you	are	seeing	him.	But	in	this	context	we	can	
    feel	that	it	refers	to	the	act	of	just	seeing	him,	you	know?	Like,	if	he’s	there,	if	you	
    see	him,	let	me	know.	So	that’s	a	closed	period.		
	
S:	 Αν	τον	δεις	[an	ton	dhis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αν	τον	δεις.		
	
S:	 Αν	τον	δεις	απόψε	[an	ton	dhis	apópse].		
	
T:	 Αν	τον	δεις	απόψε,	can	you	tell	me	it?	Can	you	tell	me,	can	you	tell	me	it?		
	
S:	 Μπορείς	να	μου	το	πεις;	[borís	na	mu	to	pis?].		
	
T:	 Good,	λέω	[léo]	and	πω	[po]	for	tell,	or	say.	So,	μπορείς	να	μου	το	πεις;	So,	If	you	
    see	him	tonight,	can	you	tell	me	it?	Αν	τον	δεις	απόψε,	μπορείς	να	μου	το	πεις;	
    [an	ton	dhis	apópse,	borís	na	mu	to	pis?].	So	we	have,	αν	for	if,	and	when,	how	
    was,	when?		
	
S:	 Πότε	[póte].		
	
T:	 Πότε.	“When”,	if	it’s	not	a	question	word	–	so	we	said	that	most	of	the	question	
    words	begin	with	P	–	when,	when	it’s	not	a	question	word,	like	in,	Tell	me	when	
    you	see	him,	no,	isn’t	πότε	[póte],	it’s,	όταν	[ótan].	Όταν.		
	
S:	 Όταν.		
	
T:	 	So	 we	 have	 αν	 [an]	 for	 if,	 and	 όταν	 [ótan]	 for	 when	 –	 when,	 when	 it’s	 not	 a	
    question	word,	which	is	very	close	to	if	in	meaning.	We	don’t	realize	how	close	it	
    is	to	if	in	meaning,	because	in	English,	when	and	if	look	so	different.	But	we	can	


                                                                                             174
   feel	 how	 the	 meanings	 are	 so	 similar	 like,	 you	 know,	 if	 we	 say,	 Can	 you	 tell	 me	
   when	you	see	him,	or,	Can	you	tell	me	if	you	see	him.	It’s	a	very	close	meaning.	So	
   αν	 is	 if,	 and	 όταν,	 when,	 our	 non-question	 when.	 So,	 let’s	 build	 a	 sentence,	 Can	
   you	tell	me	when	the	movie	is	finishing?	Can	you	tell	me?		
	
S:	 Μπορείς	να	μου	πεις	[borís	na	mu	pis].		
	
T:	 Good.	Μπορείς	να	μου	πεις	…	when	...	?		
	
S:	 Όταν	[ótan]	...		
	
T:	 Now	after	όταν,	just	like	after	αν,	you	need	to	make	a	decision	about	whether	you	
    want	the	open	or	the	closed	version	of	the	verb.	So,	what	we’re	going	to	say	is,	
    When	 the	 movie	 is	 finishing.	 Is	 this	 open	 ongoing	 or	 closed,	 When	 the	 movie	 is	
    finishing?		
	
S:	 Open.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Open.	So	we	stick	with	the	normal	verb.	Όταν,	the	movie	is	finishing.		
	
S:	 Όταν	η	ταινία	τελειώνει	[ótan	i	tenía	telióni].		
	
T:	 Very	good.		
	
S:	 Όταν	η	ταινία	τελειώνει.		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μπορείς	 να	 μου	 πεις	 όταν	 τελειώνει	 η	 ταινία	 [borís	 na	 mu	 pis	 ótan	
    telióni	i	tenía],	or,	όταν	η	ταίνια	τελειώνει	[ótan	i	tenía	telióni].	What	if	you	were	
    to	say,	Can	you	tell	me	when	the	movie	finishes?	Is	that	open	or	closed?		
	
S:	 Closed.		
	
T:	 Closed,	no?	So	here	it’s	closed,	just	because	you	referred	to	it	in	a	different	way.	
    We	don’t	mean,	When	the	movie	is	finishing	–	when	it’s	finishing	up	–	in	the	act	of	
    finishing	 –	 when	 it’s	 about	 to	 finish.	 Νo,	 we	 mean,	 When	 it	 finishes,	 or,	 When	 it	
    has	finished.	That’s	a	closed	feeling.	So	how	would	that	be?	Can	you	tell	me	when	
    the	movie	finishes?		
	
S:	 Μπορείς	 να	 μου	 πεις	 όταν	 η	 ταινία	 τελειώσει;	 [borís	 na	 mu	 pis	 ótan	 i	 tenía	
    teliósi?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good!	 Μπορείς	 να	 μου	 πεις	 όταν	 η	 ταινία	 τελειώσει;	 όταν	 τελειώσει	 η	
    ταινία;	 [ótan	 teliósi	 i	 tenía?].	 Very	 good.	 And	 you	 could	 also	 say,	 When	 it	 has	
    finished,	which	gives	practically	the	same	meaning	as,	When	it	finishes,	with	the	
    closed	 version,	 no?	 Because	 the	 closed	 version	 of	 the	 verb	 gives	 us	 that	 feeling.	
    But	we	could	also	say	this.	We	could	also	say,	Can	you	tell	me	when	the	movie	has	
    finished?		


                                                                                                175
	
S:	 Μπορείς	να	μου	πεις	όταν	η	ταινία	έχει	τελειώσει;	[borís	na	mu	pis	ótan	i	tenía	
    échi	teliósi?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μπορείς	 να	 μου	 πεις	 όταν	 η	 ταινία	 έχει	 τελειώσει;	 Or,	 όταν	 έχει	
    τελειώσει	 η	 ταινία;	 [ótan	 échi	 teliósi	 i	 tenía?].	 Very	 good.	 So	 that	 gives	 us	 very,	
    very	 similar	 meaning	 to,	 όταν	 τελειώσει	 [ótan	 teliósi],	 όταν	 έχει	 τελειώσει	 [ótan	
    échi	teliósi],	no?	But	if	you	want	to	give	a	slightly	different	meaning	of	when	the	
    movie	is	finishing	–	finishing	up	–	then	we	could	say	τελειώνει	[telióni].		
			




                                                                                                176
Complete	Greek,	Track	41	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	Πρέπει	[prépi],	πρέπει	in	Greek	means	something	like,	“It	is	necessary”.	We	
    see	it’s	a	verb	and	it’s	in	the	“he/she/it”	form.	Πρέπει.		
	
Student:	Πρέπει.		
	
T:	 That	means,	“It	is	necessary”.	And	you	can	use	this	to	say,	“have	to”.	But	πρέπει	
    doesn’t	 change	 for	 different	 people.	 You	 won’t	 say	 πέρπω,	 πρέπουν	 [prépo,	
    prépun].	 You	 will	 just	 say	 πρέπει,	 meaning,	 “It	 is	 necessary”,	 να	 [na],	 and	 then	
    whatever	 you	 want	 to	 say.	 So,	 for	 example,	 you	 could	 say	 something	 like,	 You	
    have	to	tell	me	when	it’s	finishing.	So	how	would	that	first	bit	be?	It	is	necessary,	
    να,	you	tell	me?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	μου	πεις	[prépi	na	mu	pis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	When	(non-question	when)?		
	
S:	 Όταν	[ótan].		
	
T:	 It	is	finishing.		
	
S:	 Όταν	τελειώνει	[ótan	telióni].		
	
T:	 Bravo.	Πρέπει	να	μου	πεις	όταν	τελειώνει	[prépi	na	mu	pis	ótan	telióni].	You	need	
    to	tell	me	–	you	should	tell	me	–	you	have	to	tell	me	–	when	it	is	finishing.	But	of	
    course	 we	 could	 have	 said,	 when	 it	 finishes,	 which	 is	 a	 closed	 feeling.	 Both	 are	
    going	to	fit,	just	like	in	English.	So	how	would	that	be?	You	have	to	tell	me	when	it	
    finishes.	You	have	to	tell	me	when	it	finishes.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	μου	πεις	όταν	τελειώσει	[prépi	na	mu	pis	ótan	teliósi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Όταν	τελειώσει.	The	word	for	“early,	early”,	is	νωρίς	[norís],	Nωρίς.		
	
S:	 Νωρίς,	νωρίς.		
	
T:	 Νωρίς.	You	have	to	tell	me	if	it	finishes	early.	So	the	first	bit,	You	have	to	tell	me.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	μου	πεις	[prépi	na	mu	pis].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	μου	πεις,	if	it	finishes	early.	What’s	“if”?		
	
S:	 Αν	τελειώσει	νωρίς	[an	teliósi	norís].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 μου	 πεις	 αν	 τελειώσει	 νωρίς	 [prépi	 na	 mu	 pis	 an	 teliósi	
    norís].	How	was,	I	write,	I’m	writing?		
	


                                                                                              177
S:	 Γράφω	[ghráfo].		
	
T:	 Γράφω.	And	we	saw	υπογράφω	[ipoghráfo],	which	means	“to	below	write”,	which	
    is	“to	sign”.		
	
S:	 Sign.		
	
T:	 We	 also	 have	 διαγράφω	 [dhiaghráfo],	 διαγράφω.	 Now	 δια	 [dhia]	 means	
    “through”	or	“away	from”.	These	little	words	tend	to	have	a	lot	of	meanings,	no,	
    in	vocabulary	building.	But,	through	is	a	nice	one	to	think	of	here	because,	if	we	
    imagine	 it	 quite	 literally,	 to	 write	 through,	 what	 do	 you	 think	 it	 might	 mean,	
    διαγράφω	–	To	write	through;	To	through	write?	What	do	you	do	when	you	write	
    through	something?		
	
S:	 Make	a	line?		
	
T:	 To	write	through?	You	cross	something	out.		
	
S:	 Yeah.		
	
T:	 So,	διαγράφω,	διαγράφω,	is	“I	delete”.	So	we	get	that.		
	
S:	 Διαγράφω.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	have	deleted	it?		
	
S:	 Έχω	διαγράψει	[ékho	dhiaghrápsi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	And	the	“it”?	I	have	deleted	it.		
	
S:	 Tο	έχω	διαγράψει	[to	ékho	dhiaghrápsi].		
	
T:	 Το	έχω	διαγράψει.	How	would	you	say,	I	have	to	delete	it?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	το	διαγράψω	[prépi	na	to	dhiaghrápso].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πρέπει	να	το	διαγράψω.	So	we	don’t	want	to	let	it	confuse	us	that	both	of	
    these	things,	we	do	with	“have”	in	English.	I	have	deleted	it.	I	have	to	delete	it.	So,	
    the	 “have”	 past	 of	 course	 is,	 έχω	 [ékho],	 but	 “have	 to”,	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 must,	 is	
    πρέπει	[prépi].	Περιγράφω	[perighráfo],	περιγράφω,	“to	around	write”,	if	you	had	
    to	guess,	what	do	you	think	it	might	mean?	This	is	just	imagination,	no?	There’s	
    no	way	really	to	know,	but	it’s	a	very	good	practice	to	start	guessing,	because	you	
    know	then	we	interiorise	a	lot	of	the	Greek	we	come	across,	if	we	just	get	in	the	
    habit	of	picking	it	apart	always.	So,	περιγράφω	means	around-write.	What	might	
    that	mean?		
	
S:	 To	describe?		


                                                                                                178

T:	 Yes	exactly,	very	good.	Describe.	Good.	And	in	English	it’s	formed	in	a	similar	way,

Teacher:	So	we	have	λέω	[léo],	which	is	“I	say”	or	“I	tell”,	no,	and	πω	[po],	which	is	
    the	 closed	 version.	 So	 we	 said	 that	 when	 we	 get	 these	 really	 crazy	 irregularities	
    between	the	standard	and	the	closed	form	of	the	verbs,	like	in	λέω,	πω,	for	“I	say”	
    or	 “I	 tell”,	 or	 βλέπω,	 δω	 [vlépo,	 dho],	 for	 “I	 see”,	 τρώω,	 φάω	 [tróo,	 fáo],	 for	 “I	
    eat”.	When	that	happens,	we	can	suspect	that	those	two	originated	from	different	
    verbs.	 Much	 like	 go	 and	 went	 in	 English.	 Apart	 from	 λέω,	 we	 also	 have	 επιλέγω	
    [epilégho]	 and	 διαλέγω	 [dhialégho];	 both	 of	 these	 mean	 “to	 choose”.	 Now	 you	
    notice	 there	 we	 have	 λέγω	 with	 the	 [gh],	 with	 the	 γάμα	 [γ,	 gháma],	 like	 in	 εγώ,	
    no?	Now	that	[gh]	fell	away	in	λέω.	Historically,	λέω	[léo]	was	λέγω	[légho].	But	
    you	could	imagine	with	such	a	common	verb,	so	much	λέγω,	λέγω,	λέγω,	λέγω,	it	
    became	λέω.	But	in	the	other	verbs,	the	G	(γ)	pops	back	out,	so	we	get	επιλέγω,	
    διαλέγω,	both	of	these	meaning,	“to	choose”.		
	
Student:	Eπιλέγω,	διαλέγω	[epilégho,	dhialégho].		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	What	are	you	choosing?		
	
S:	 Τι	επιλέγεις;	[ti	epilégis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Τι	επιλέγεις;	[ti	epiléyis?].	Τι	διαλέγεις;	[ti	dhialéyis?].	The	closed	version	of	
    these	 verbs	 has	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 πω	 [po].	 We	 get	 from	 επιλέγω:	 επιλέξω	
    [epilékso].	 And	 we	 get	 from	 διαλέγω:	 διαλέξω	 [dhialékso].	 That’s	 where	 we	 get	
    dialect	 from	 –	 διαλέξω,	 a	 choice	 of	 different	 words	 and	 elements	 from	 the	
    language,	the	dialect.	So	how	would	we	say,	What	have	you	chosen?		
	
S:	 Τι	έχεις	επιλέξει;	[ti	échis	epiléksi?].		
	
T:	 Τι	έχεις	επιλέξει;	Τι	έχεις	διαλέξει;	[ti	échis	dhialéksi?].	How	would	you	say,	Υou	
    have	to	choose?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	επιλέξεις	[prépi	na	epiléksis].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	 να	 επιλέξεις.	 Πρέπει	 να	 διαλέξεις	 [prépi	 na	 dhialéksis].	 And	 I	 said	 that	
    διαλέξει	 [dhialéksi],	 we	 can	 relate	 to	 dialect,	 and	 actually	 λέξη	 [léksi],	 λέξη	 in	
    Greek	means	“word”.		
	
S:	 Word.		
	
T:	 Μία	λέξη	[mía	léksi].		
	
S:	 Μία	λέξη.		
	
T:	 So	what	gender	is	that?		
	
S:	 Feminine.		


                                                                                                 181
	
T:	 Feminine.	 Now	 we	 saw	 the	 plural	 pattern	 for	 feminine	 of	 αυτή	 [aftí]	 to	 αυτές	
    [aftés],	 no?	 Μέρα,	 μέρες	 [méra,	 méres]	 –	 “day,	 days”.	 That’s	 the	 most	 common	
    feminine	plural	pattern,	but	we	will	come	across	others.	For	example,	the	plural	of	
    λέξη	is	λέξεις	[léksis],	λέξεις.		
	
S:	 Λέξεις.		
	
T:	 Λέξη	 and	 λέξεις.	 We’ve	 already	 seen	 another	 word	 as	 well	 that	 has	 that	 plural	
    pattern.	What	was	the	word	for	city,	like	in	“cosmopolitan”?		
	
S:	 Πόλη	[póli].		
	
T:	 Πόλη.	 And	 the	 plural	 of	 city	 is	 formed	 in	 the	 same	 way,	 so	 how	 would	 you	 say	
    cities?		
	
S:	 Πόλεις	[pólis].		
	
T:	 Πόλεις,	good.	We	had,	I	buy,	from	agoraphobia,	the	fear	of	the	open	spaces,	or	
    the	public	spaces,	coming	from	marketplace.	How	was	that,	I	buy?		
	
S:	 Αγοράσω	[aghoráso]?		
	
T:	 Αγοράζω	[aghorázo].		
	
S:	 Αγοράζω.		
	
T:	 And	what	was	the	closed	version	of,	αγοράζω?		
	
S:	 Αγοράσω	[aghoráso].		
	
T:	 Αγοράσω.	How	would	you	say,	I	have	bought	it?		
	
S:	 Έχω	αγοράσει	[ékho	aghorási].		
	
T:	 Good,	and	the	‘”it”?		
	
S:	 Το	έχω	αγοράσει	[to	ékho	aghorási].		
	
T:	 Το	έχω	αγοράσει.	And,	I	have	to	buy	it?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	το	αγοράσω	[prépi	na	to	aghoráso].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πρέπει	να	το	αγοράσω,	πρέπει	να	το	αγοράσω.	How	would	you	say,	I	have	
    to	buy	them,	and	we	mean	neuter	things?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τα	αγοράσω	[prépi	na	ta	aghoráso].		


                                                                                            182
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τα	αγοράσω.	If	we	want	the	word	for	them,	for	feminine,	we	can	use	
    the	 plural	 pattern	 that	 we	 see	 between	 πόλη	 [póli]	 and	 πόλεις	 [pólis],	 and	
    between	λέχη	(word)	and	λέχεις	(words).	So	we	went	from	το	[to]	to	τα	[to].	And	
    we	can	go	from	την	[tin]	for	her,	to	τις	[tis]	...		
	
S:	 Τις	[tis].		
	
T:	 …	 for	 them,	 for	 feminine.	 So	 that’s	 just	 like	 the	 plural	 pattern	 that	 we	 found	 in	
    λέχη,	λέχεις	[léksi,	léksis]	and	πόλη,	πόλεις	[póli,	pólis].	We	get	τις	[tis].	Τις.	So	if	
    you	 wanted	 to	 say,	 I	 have	 to	 buy	 them,	 and	 you	 were	 referring	 to	 feminine	
    objects,	how	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	αγοράσω	[prépi	na	tis	aghoráso].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πρέπει	να	τις	αγοράσω.	And	if	you	wanted	to	say,	I	have	to	see	them,	and	
    you	meant	females,	a	group	of	females,	or	of	feminine	things,	how	would	it	be?	I	
    have	to	see	them.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	βλέπω	…	δω	[prépi	na	tis	vlépo	…	dho].		
	
T:	 Good.	Δω	[dho].	But	you	might	also	want	to	say	something	like,	I	have	to	see	them	
    more	often,	no?	“More	often”	was	πιο	[pyo],	the	word	for	more,	συχνά	[sikhná].	
    Πιο	συχνά	[pyo	sikhná].	So	how	would	that	be,	I	have	to	see	them	more	often?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	δω	πιο	συχνά	[prépi	na	tis	dho	pyo	sikhná].		
	
T:	 So	 there’s	 a	 contradiction	 there	 between,	 δω	 [dho],	 which	 is	 closed,	 and	 πιο	
    συχνά	which	is	open	and	ongoing.	So	we	need	to	go	back	to	the	standard	form	of,	
    I	see,	I’m	seeing,	which	is	…	?		
	
S:	 Βλέπω	[vlépo].		
	
T:	 Βλέπω,	good.	So,	I	have	to	see	them	more	often,	and	we	mean	feminine	them?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	βλέπω	πιο	συχνά	[prépi	na	tis	vlépo	pyo	sikhná].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πρέπει	να	τις	βλέπω	πιο	συχνά.

Teacher:	So	we	saw	some	strange	closed	versions	of	the	verbs,	no,	where	the	verb	
    changes	completely	in	its	closed	form.	So,	for	example,	we	had,	I	see,	which	is	…	?		
	
Student:	Βλέπω	[vlépo].		
	
T:	 Βλέπω.	And	then	the	closed	version	is?		
	
S:	 Δω	[dho].		
	
T:	 Δω.	Very	different.	How	would	you	say,	We	will	see?		
	
S:	 Θα	βλέπουμε	[tha	vlépume].		
	
T:	 Ok.	This	will	be	more	like,	We	will	be	seeing,	no?		
	
S:	 Yeah.	Θα	δούμε	[tha	dhúme].		
	
T:	 Θα	δούμε.	No?	We’ll	see.	Θα	δούμε.	Shall	we	see?		
	
S:	 Να	δούμε;	[na	dhúme?].		
	
T:	 Να	δούμε;	Very	good.	I	like	how	you	change	your	tone	of	voice	there.	Να	δούμε;	
    Because	if	you	were	to	say	with	a	more	affirmative	tone	of	voice	–	give	me	that.		
	
S:	 Να	δούμε	[na	dhúme].		
	
T:	 Να	δούμε.	What	would	that	mean?		
	
S:	 We	shall	see.		
	
T:	 Yeah,	like,	Let’s	see.	What	was,	I	eat?		
	
S:	 Τρώω	[tróo].		
	
T:	 Τρώω.	Good.	And,	We	eat?		
	
S:	 Τρώμε	[tróme].		
	
T:	 Τρώμε.	So	it’s	irregular,	but	we	still	have	the	ME	(με)	of	“-ουμε”	[ume],	no?	But	
    here	τρώμε	[tróme].	And	the	closed	version	of,	τρώω	[tróo]?		
	
S:	 Φάω	[fáo].		
	
T:	 Φάω.	Good.	And,	Shall	we	eat?		
	


                                                                                    184
S:	 Να	φάμε;	[na	fáme?].		
	
T:	 Να	φάμε;	Very	good.	Να	φάμε;	So	again,	just	the	ΜΕ	(με)	for	we.	Να	φάμε;	Let’s	
    eat.		
	
S:	 Να	φάμε	[na	fáme].		
	
T:	 Να	φάμε.	Να	φάμε.	We	also	have	another	word	for	let’s,	which	is	very	common,	
    and	that’s	ας	[as],	ΑS.	Ας.		
	
S:	 Ας.		
	
T:	 So	using,	ας,	you	could	say,	Let’s	see.		
	
S:	 	Ας	δούμε	[as	dhúme].		
	
T:	 Let’s	eat.		
	
S:	 Aς	φάμε	[as	fáme].		
	
T:	 Aς	 φάμε.	 And	 again,	 we’re	 using	 the	 closed	 version,	 no?	 We’re	 referring	 to	 a	
    closed	period	of	time.	Ας	δούμε.	But	you	know,	we	might	say	something	like,	Let’s	
    see	it	more	often,	no,	in	which	case	we	could	use	βλέπουμε	[vlépume].	What	was,	
    I	say,	or	I	tell?		
	
S:	 Λέω	[léo].		
	
T:	 Λέω.	And	we	mentioned	that	this	verb	is	used	in	some	colloquial	ways.	You	could	
    say,	for	example,	τα	λέμε	[ta	léme].	We	said	that	this	is	used	like,	See	you	later,	
    you	know.	Τα	λέμε	–	literally,	We’ll	talk	about	them	…	things.	We’ll	talk	again.	See	
    you	again.	Τα	λέμε.

T:	 We	could	say,	What	are	you	saying?		
	
S:	 Tι	λες;	[ti	les?].		
	
T:	 Tι	 λες;	 Tι	 λες;	 You	 could	 also	 hear,	 λες	 και	 [les	ke].	 Λες	 και,	 followed	 by,	 I	 don’t	
    know,	for	example,	Λες	και	ηταν	φάντασμα	[les	ke	ítan	fántasma],	As	if	it	were	a	
    ghost.	Λες	και.	“As	if”,	“as	though”.	What	are	you	saying	to	me?		
	
S:	 Tι	μου	λες;	[ti	mu	les?].		
	
T:	 Tι	μου	λες;	Good.	So	we	have	μου	[mu],	“to	me”,	no?	You	also	might	hear,	Tι	με	
    λες;	 [ti	 me	 les?],	 depending	 on	 dialect,	 like	 in	 Thessaloniki,	 for	 example,	 or	
    Salonica,	you	could	hear,	Tι	με	λες;	So,	if	you	do	hear	that,	don’t	think	that	you’ve	


                                                                                                   185
   misunderstood	the	rules	about	when	to	use	με	[me],	and	when	to	use	μου	[mu].	
   This	 is	 just	 a	 change	 in	 dialect.	 We	 could	 also	 have,	 ψέματα	 λες	 [psémata	 les].	
   Ψέματα	λες.		
	
S:	 Ψέματα	λες.		
	
T:	 You’re	lying.	Lies	you	say.	Ψέματα	λες.	So	this	verb	is	used	in	quite	a	few	colloquial	
    ways.	Λέω	[léo].	You	could	say,	But	what	am	I	saying?	The	word	for	“but”	would	
    be	μα	[ma].	Μα.		
	
S:	 Μα.		
	
T:	 But	what	am	I	saying?		
	
S:	 Mα	τι	λέω;	[ma	ti	léo?].		
	
T:	 Mα	τι	λέω;	No?	When	you	think	you’ve	said	something	stupid,	you	can	say,	Mα	τι	
    λέω;	Or	if	you’ve	forgotten	something.	Mα	τι	λέω;	What	is	the	closed	version	of	
    λέω	[léo]?		
	
S:	 Πω	[po].		
	
T:	 Πω.	How	would	you	say,	Let’s	say?		
	
S:	 Aς	πούμε	[as	púme].		
	
T:	 Aς	πούμε.	And	you	will	hear	this	all	the	time	in	Greek.	Aς	πούμε.	Aς	πούμε,	like,	
    like	“like”,	you	know,	sometimes	how	you	use	“like”	in	English,	to	just	to	kind	of	
    interject	a	sentence,	maybe	to	give	you	a	second	more	to	think,	no?	Aς	πούμε.	So	
    this	is	very	common.	So,	ας	[as]	is	like	να	[na].	Ιt	doesn’t	really	mean	anything	by	
    itself,	 but	 it’s	 actually	 from	 the	 verb,	 αφήνω	 [afíno].	 Aφήνω,	 which	 means,	 “I	
    leave”,	in	the	sense	of,	“I	leave	something”	or	“I	leave	someone”,	or	“I	would	like	
    to	leave	a	message”.	Aφήνω.		
	
S:	 Aφήνω.		
	
T:	 Whose	closed	version	is	αφήσω	[afíso].	Aφήσω.		
	
S:	 Aφήσω.		
	
T:	 And	this	is,	of	course,	where	we	get	ας	[as]	from.	So	we	have	αφήνω,	“I	leave”,	
    like,	to	leave	something	or	someone.	How	would	you	say,	I’m	leaving	it	here?		
	
S:	 Το	αφήνω	εδώ	[to	afíno	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	αφήνω	εδώ.	Shall	I	leave	it	here?		
	


                                                                                            186
S:	 Nα	το	αφήσω	εδώ;	[na	to	afíso	edhó?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.	Nα	το	αφήσω	εδώ;	So	you	could	say,	Where	shall	I	leave	
    you?	Like,	to	drop	you	off.	Where	shall	I	leave	you?	What	was,	Where?		
	
S:	 Πού	[pu].		
	
T:	 Πού.	Good.	So,	Where	shall	I	leave	you?		
	
S:	 Πού	να	σε	αφήσω;	[pu	na	se	afíso?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	να	σε	αφήσω;	Shall	I	leave	you	it	here?	Shall	I	leave	you	it	here?	
    Shall	I	leave	it	here	for	you?	But	in	Greek,	you	know	we	just	can	say,	“you	it”.		
	
S:	 Να	σε	το	αφήσω	εδώ;	[na	se	to	afíso	edhó?].		
	
T:	 But	here	“you”	is	not	like,	to	leave	you,	it	is	to	leave	something,	to	you,	for	you.	So	
    rather	than	σε	[se],	we	would	use?		
	
S:	 Nα	σου	το	αφήσω	εδώ;	[na	sou	to	afíso	edhó?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Nα	σου	το	αφήσω	εδώ;	And,	σου	το	[su	to],	you	can	also	contract.	To?		
	
S:	 Nα	στο	αφήσω	εδώ;	[na	sto	afíso	edhó?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Nα	στο	αφήσω	εδώ;	Both	are	fine,	no?	Nα	σου	το	αφήσω	εδώ;	Nα	στο	
    αφήσω	 εδώ;	 So	 we	 see	 that	 other	 than	 “to	 you”,	 σου	 [su]	 can	 also	 be	 like	 “for	
    you”,	if	the	translation	fits	better	like	this.	No?	Like	in	this	case,	Shall	I	leave	it	here	
    for	 you?	 Nα	 σου	 το	 αφήσω	 εδώ;	 “A	 message”,	 in	 Greek	 is,	 ένα	 μήνυμα	 [éna	
    mínima].	Ένα	μήνυμα.		
	
S:	 Ένα	μήνυμα.		
	
T:	 So	what	gender	is	μήνυμα	[mínima]?	Ένα	μήνυμα.		
	
S:	 Ένα	[éna]	is	neutral.		
	
T:	 Neuter.	Good.	So	how	would	you	say,	The	message?		
	
S:	 Tο	μήνυμα	[to	mínima].		
	
T:	 Tο	μήνυμα.	Very	good.	Shall	I	leave	you	a	message?		
	
S:	 Να	σου	αφήσω	ένα	μήνυμα;	[na	su	afíso	éna	mínima?].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	in	Greek,	you	don’t	really	need	the	ένα	[éna].	So	much	more	common	
    would	be,	Να	σου	αφήσω	μήνυμα;	[na	su	afíso	mínima?].		


                                                                                             187
	
S:	 Να	σου	αφήσω	μήνυμα;		
	
T:	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 They	 have	 left	 you	 a	 message?	 So,	 They	 have	 left	 you	 a	
    message.		
	
S:	 Σου	έχουνε	αφήσει	μήνυμα	[su	ékhune	afísi	mínima].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Σου	έχουν	αφήσει	μήνυμα	[su	ékhun	afísi	mínima].	Σου	έχουνε	αφήσει	
    μήνυμα.	 We’ve	 seen	 that	 with	 the	 “they”	 form,	 we	 can	 have	 “-ουν”	 [un]	 or	
    “-ουνε”	[une].	Έχουν,	έχουνε.	Let’s	leave	a	message.		
	
S:	 Nα	αφήσουμε	μήνυμα	[na	afísume	mínima].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Nα	 αφήσουμε	 μήνυμα.	 Or	 maybe	 more	 common	 than,	 να	 [na]	 for	 “let’s”	
    would	be?		
	
S:	 Ας	[as].	Ας	αφήσουμε	μήνυμα	[as	afísume	mínima].		
	
T:	 Ας	αφήσουμε	μήνυμα.	So	actually,	ας	and,	αφήσουμε	are	coming	from	the	same	
    verb,	no?	So	we	have	με	[me]	and	μου	[mu],	no?	Mε	for	“me”,	and	μου	for	“to	
    me”,	or	maybe	“for	me”;	σε	[se]	and	σου	[su],	σε	for	“you”,	and	then	σου	for	“to	
    you”,	and	maybe	“for	you”.	What	was	the	word	for	him,	like	in,	I	see	him?		
	
S:	 Τον	[ton].		
	
T:	 Τον.	 “To	 him”,	 or	 sometimes	 “for	 him”,	 as	 we’re	 seeing,	 might	 be,	 if	 we	 have	
    με/μου	[me/mu],	σε/σου	[se/su],	τον	[ton]	and	…	?		
	
S:	 Του	[tu].		
	
T:	 Του.	Very	good.	Let’s	leave	him	a	message.	Let’s	leave	him	message.		
	
S:	 Του	 αφήσουμε	 μήνυμα	 [tu	 afísoume	 mínima].	 Ας	 του	 αφήσουμε	 μήνυμα	 [as	 tu	
    afísoume	mínima].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ας	του	αφήσουμε	μήνυμα.	Very	good.	Have	you	left	him	a	message?		
	
S:	 Του	έχεις	αφήσει	μήνυμα;	[tu	échis	afísi	mínima?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Του	έχεις	αφήσει	μήνυμα;	But	just,	Have	you	left	him?,	would	be?		
	
S:	 Του	έχεις	αφήσει;	[tu	ékhis	afísi?].		
	
T:	 Ι	would	be	waiting	to	hear	what	you’ve	left	him.		
	
S:	 Umm?		


                                                                                          188
	
T:	 But	just,	Have	you	left	him?	Not,	left	him	something,	but	left	him?		
	
S:	 Τον	έχεις	αφήσει;	[ton	échis	afísi?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τον	έχεις	αφήσει;	Very	good.	Where	have	you	left	it?		
	
S:	 Πού	το	έχεις	αφήσει;	[pu	to	échis	afísi?].		
	
T:	 Πού	το	έχεις	αφήσει;	And	this	is	a	neuter	it,	no?	We	could	also	have	a	masculine	
    it,	as	well.	So,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Πού	…	masculine	it?		
	
T:	 Same	as	him.		
	
S:	 Πού	τον	έχεις	αφήσει;	[pu	ton	échis	afísi?].		
	
T:	 If	 we	 are	 talking	 about	 a	 masculine	 thing,	 we	 will	 just	 use	 him.	 Πού	 τον	 έχεις

Teacher:	What	was,	the	message?		
	
Student:	To	μήνυμα	[to	mínima].		
	
T:	 To	μήνυμα.	And,	the	house?		
	
S:	 To	σπίτι	[to	spíti].		
	
T:	 To	σπίτι.	And,	the	car?		
	
S:	 To	αυτοκίνητο	[to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 To	αυτοκίνητο.	Very	good.	The	self-moving,	no,	the	self-kinetic,	the	auto-mobile.	
    And,	the	cars?		
	
S:	 Tα	αυτοκίνητα	[ta	aftokínita].		
	
T:	 Tα	αυτοκίνητα.	Very	good.	How	was,	the	houses?		
	
S:	 Τα	σπίτια	[ta	spitya].		
	
T:	 Τα	 σπίτια.	 Very	 good.	 So	 we	 saw	 that	 to	 get	 the	 plural	 with	 neuter	 nouns,	 we	
    change	the	[o]	(ο)	to	an	[a]	(α)	–	αυτοκίνητο,	αυτοκίνητα	[aftokínitο,	aftokínita]	–	
    and	 we	 do	 the	 same	 with	 the	 word	 for	 “the”	 of	 course,	 το	 [to]	 to	 τα	 [ta]	 –	 το	
    αυτοκίνητο,	τα	αυτοκίνητα	[to	aftokínitο,	ta	aftokínita].	And	if	we	don’t	end	with	
    an	[o],	like	in	σπίτι	[spíti],	we	just	add	it,	the	A	(α),	on	the	end:	σπίτια.	Το	σπίτι,	τα	
    σπίτια	[to	spíti,	ta	spítya].	But	we	can’t	very	well	add	an	A	to	an	A.	“Messages”	is	
    μηνύματα	[minímata].	Μηνύματα.		
	
S:	 Μηνύματα.		
	
T:	 So	actually	it’s	like	we	add	the	plural	the	(τα	[ta])	onto	the	end.	But	also	when	we	
    do	 that,	 we	 add	 another	 syllable,	 so	 the	 accent	 moves:	 μήνυμα,	 μηνύματα	
    [mínima,	minímata].	The	stress	moves:	μήνυμα,	μηνύματα.		
	
S:	 Μήνυμα,	μηνύματα.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	So	we	saw	the	word	for	problem,	in	Greek,	do	you	remember?		
	
S:	 Το	πρόβλημα	[to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Πρόβλημα.	Very	good.	Tο	πρόβλημα.	So	problems,	would	be?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματα	[ta	provlimata].	
	


                                                                                               190
T:	 Good.	 Προβλήματα.	 Tα	 προβλήματα.	 Very	 good.	 I	 mentioned	 briefly	 the	
    expression,	“you’re	lying”,	“lies	you	say”:	ψέματα	λες	[psémata	les].	Ψέματα	λες.	
    So,	lies	is	ψέματα.	And	this	is	another	situation	of	adding	τα	[ta]	to	get	the	plural,	
    because	the	noun	already	ends	in	A	(α).	So	how	would	the	singular,	lie,	be?		
	
S:	 Ψέμα	[pséma].		
	
T:	 Ψέμα.	Very	good.	And	this	[ps],	we	mentioned	how	it’s	just	one	letter	in	Greek,	
    this	PS	(ψ),	written	as	one	letter.	Looking	like	that	fork,	no,	the	letter	that	looks	
    like	 a	 fork	 (Ψ/ψ).	 What	 was,	 I	 leave?	 Like,	 to	 leave	 something	 or,	 to	 leave	
    someone?		
	
S:	 Αφήνω	[afíno].		
	
T:	 Αφήνω,	A-F-I-N-O.	And	the	closed	form?		
	
S:	 Αφήσω	[afíso].		
	
T:	 Αφήσω.	Where	shall	I	leave	you?	Where	shall	I	leave	you?		
	
S:	 Πού	να	σε	αφήσω;	[pu	na	se	afíso?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	να	σε	αφήσω;	So	this	would	be	like,	Where	shall	I	drop	you	off?	
    No?	Πού	να	σε	αφήσω;	Let’s	leave	him	here.		
	
S:	 Ας	τον	αφήσουμε	εδώ	[as	ton	afísume	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ας	τον	αφήσουμε	εδώ.	Να	τον	αφήσουμε	εδώ	[na	ton	afísume	edhó].	
    So	 with	 να	 [na]	 you	 would	 kind	 of	 need	 more	 voice	 to	 show	 that	 it’s	 “let’s”,	
    whereas	with	ας	[as]	it’s	not	so	necessary.	Ας	τον	αφήσουμε	εδώ.	Let’s	leave	him	
    a	message.		
	
S:	 Ας	τον	αφήσουμε	μήνυμα	[as	ton	afísume	mínima].		
	
T:	 So	here	we’re	not	leaving	him,	no?	We’re	leaving	a	message,	to	him,	for	him.	
	
S:	 Ας	του	αφήσουμε	μήνυμα	[as	tu	afísume	mínima].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ας	του	αφήσουμε	μήνυμα.	We’ve	left	him	many	messages.	What	was	
    the	word	for	very	or	a	lot?		
	
S:	 Πολλοί	[polí].		
	
T:	 Πολλοί.	Very	good.	With	two	L’s	(λλ),	but	pronounced	in	the	same	way,	this	word	
    very,	or	a	lot,	means	many,	and	it	also	agrees	with	the	noun	it	refers	to.	So	to	say	
    many	 messages,	 we	 won’t	 have	 πολλοί	 μηνύματα	 [polí	 minímata];	 Πολλοί	 will	
    change	to	match	this	neuter	plural.	So	how	would	that	be,	many	messages?		


                                                                                           191
	
S:	 Πολλά	μηνύματα	[polá	minímata].		
	
T:	 Πολλά	μηνύματα.	Very	good.	So,	We’ve	left	him	many	messages.		
	
S:	 Του	έχουμε	αφήσει	πολλά	μηνύματα	[tu	ékhume	afísi	polá	minímata].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Του	έχουμε	αφήσει	πολλά	μηνύματα.	We’ve	left	him	many	messages.	
    What	was	her,	or	feminine	it?		
	
S:	 Την	[tin].		
	
T:	 Την.	Good.	We	have	τον	[ton]	and	την	[tin],	no,	for	“him”	and	“her”.	Where	have	
    you	left	her?	or,	Where	have	you	left	it?,	referring	to	a	feminine	thing?		
	
S:	 Πού	την	έχεις	αφήσει;	[pu	tin	échis	afísi?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	την	έχεις	αφήσει;	And	we	saw	the	plural	of	την	[tin],	which	is?		
	
S:	 Τις	[tis].		
	
T:	 Τις.	So	this	is	for	“them”,	referring	to	females	or	feminine	objects.	Την	[tin]	is	spelt	
    T-[íta]-N,	so	with	the	I	[i]	sound	that	looks	like	an	“n”,	that	has	the	tail	going	below	
    the	line.	But	then	τις	[tis],	the	plural,	is	spelt	with	γιώτα	[yióta]	(Ι/ι),	which	is	the	I	
    sound	in	Greek	that	looks	like	the	English	“I”.	Where	have	you	left	them	(females)?		
	
S:	 Πού	τις	έχεις	αφήσει;	[pu	tis	échis	afísi?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Πού	 τις	 έχεις	 αφήσει;	 So	 this	 could	 refer	 to	 people	 or	 objects,	 no?	
    Where	 have	 you	 left	 them?	 (feminine	 things),	 or	 Where	 have	 you	 left	 them?	
    (feminine	 people,	 females).	 Της	 [tis]	 is	 also	 used	 for	 “to	 her”,	 but	 spelt	 with	 ήτα	
    [íta]	like	την	[tin],	so	spelt	with	T	(τ)	and	the	“i”	sound	[i]	that	looks	like	the	“n”,	
    with	the	tail	going	below	the	line,	and	then	the	Greek	“s”	(σ/ς).	Της.		
	
S:	 Της.		
	
T:	 So,	we	saw	that	the	τις	[tis]	of	the	plural	is	spelt	with	the	γιώτα	[yióta]	(Ι/ι),	that	
    looks	like	an	I,	and	then	της	[tis]	for	“to	her”,	with	ήτα	[íta],	that	looks	a	little	bit	
    like	 an	 “n”.	 But	 of	 course,	 to	 the	 ear,	 they’re	 both	 the	 same.	 You	 don’t	 have	 to	
    worry	about	remembering	that,	of	course;	I	just	mention	so	that	you	can	notice	
    the	difference	whenever	you	read	it,	and	just	be	reminded	of	it	in	that	way.	So,	
    we	have	την	[tin]	for	“her”,	and	τις	[tis]	for	“them”,	the	plural	of	“her”,	and	also	
    for	“to	her”	–	της	[tis].	So,	Where	have	you	left	her?	How	is	that?		
	
S:	 Πού	την	έχεις	αφήσει;	[pu	tin	échis	afísi?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	την	έχεις	αφήσει;	What	have	you	left	her	(for	her)?		


                                                                                                192
	
S:	 Τι	της	έχεις	αφήσει;	[ti	tis	échis	afísi?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τι	της	έχεις	αφήσει;	No?	Because	it’s,	What	have	you	left	to	her,	for	
    her?	What	have	you	bought	her?	What	was,	I	buy?		
	
S:	 Αγοράζω	[aghorázo].		
	
T:	 Αγοράζω.	Good	–	related	to	“agorophobia”,	no,	which	is	the	fear	of	open	spaces,	
    like	the	αγορά	[aghorá],	the	market.	Αγοράζω.	What	have	you	bought	her?		
	
S:	 Τι	της	έχεις	αγοράσει;	[ti	tis	échis	aghorási?]		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 very	 good.	 Τι	 της	 έχεις	 αγοράσει;	 And	 you	 moved	 from	 αγοράζω	
    [aghorázo]	to	 αγοράσει	 [aghorási],	 the	 Z	 (ζ)	to	 the	S	 (σ),	 to	 get	 the	closed	 form.	
    Very	good.	How	did	we	express	the	idea	of	have	to,	like,	I	have	to?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	[prépi	na].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	 να.	 Good.	 And,	 πρέπει	 [prépi],	 we	 said	 literally,	 is	 like,	 “it	 is	 necessary”,	
    something	 like	 that,	 no?	 And	 it	 doesn’t	 change,	 depending	 on	 the	 person.	 But	
    actually,	often	when	I	get	this	word	I	think	of	my	cousins,	who	say	πρέπω	[prépo].	
    Let	me	explain.	Do	you	know	what	is	a	forced	native?		
	
S:	 No.		
	
T:	 So	 a	 forced	 native	 is,	 like,	 for	 example,	 you	 know:	 you	 are	 born	 in	 the	 UK,	 you	
    learn	Greek	from	your	parents,	and	you’re	not	a	native	because	you	don’t	really	
    have	all	of	the	exposure	to	the	language	to	be	a	native.	But	you’re	a	forced	native,	
    ’cause	you’re	kind	of	a	native.	Most	of	the	time	you	sound	native	until	you	make	
    some	 crazy	 language	 transfer	 from	 English	 or	 something	 else,	 and	 you	 say	
    something	 like	 πρέπω	 [prépo],	 no,	 or	 an	 overgeneralisation	 of	 the	 very	 same	
    language	of	Greek,	no,	and	you	never	realise	it,	So,	I	mention	this	because	many	
    of	you	may	be	learning	Greek	to	practice	with	forced	natives	that	you	have	in	your	
    cities,	 or	 whatever.	 So	 if	 their	 grammar	 confuses	 you,	 and	 you	 think	 it’s	 wrong,	
    you	might	just	be	right.	How	would	you	say,	I	have	to	see	her,	or	I	have	to	see	it	(a	
    feminine	thing)?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	την	βλέπω	[prépi	va	tin	vlépo].	Ah.	Πρέπει	να	την	δω	[prépi	va	tin	dho].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 την	 δω.	 It	 could	 be	 possible,	 πρέπει	 να	 την	 βλέπω,	 but	 this	
    would	be,	“I	have	to	be	seeing	her”.	The	translation	is	not	very	comfortable,	but	
    we	can	understand	the	context,	you	know,	like,	I	have	to	see	her	more	often,	is	the	
    nice	example	–	πιο	συχνά	[pyo	sikhná],	more	often.	We	would	use	βλέπω	[vlépo].	
    Πρέπει	 να	 την	 βλέπω	 πιο	 συχνά	 [prépi	 va	 tin	 vlépo	 pyo	 sikhná].	 Otherwise,	 we	
    refer	to	a	closed	moment	in	time,	πρέπει	να	την	δω	[prépi	va	tin	dho].	And,	I	have	
    to	see	them	(referring	to	females)?		


                                                                                                193
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	δω	[prépi	va	tis	dho].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	δω.	I	have	to	tell	her.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	...	Hmm?	Πρέπει	να	της	πω	[prépi	na	tis	po].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πρέπει	να	της	πω.	Because	this	is	“to	her”,	no?	We	could	also	have,	πρέπει	
    να	της	το	πω	[prépi	na	tis	to	po].	I	have	to	tell	her	it,	depending	on	the	context.	
    You	have	to	see	him.	You	have	to	see	him.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τον	δεις	[prépi	na	ton	dhis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πρέπει	να	τον	δεις.	You	have	to	tell	him.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	του	πεις	[prépi	na	tu	pis].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	του	πεις.	To	him.	Πρέπει	να	του	πεις.	Πρέπει	να	του	το	πεις	[prépi	na	tu	
    to	pis].	The	plural	of	του	[tu]	is	τους	[tus].	Tους.		
	
S:	 Tους.		
	
T:	 And	this	is	the	word	for	“to	them”,	masculine	or	mixed,	and	also	for	feminine	“to	
    them”.	It	counts	for	everyone	when	it’s	“to	them”,	for	masculine	or	feminine,	or	
    even	 neuter	 “to	 them”.	 Neuter	 also	 is	 τους	 [tus],	 “to	 them”.	 So,	 whenever	 we	
    mean	“to	them”,	we	use	τους.	So,	I	have	to	tell	them.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	πω	[prépi	na	tus	po].		
	
T:	 Good.	You	have	to	leave	them	a	message.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	αφήσεις	μήνυμα	[prépi	na	tus	afísis	mínima].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πρέπει	να	τους	αφήσεις	μήνυμα.	Very	good.	So,	τους	[tus],	the	plural	
    of	του	[tu],	works	for	“to	them”,	but	also	just	for	plain	old	“them”,	not	“to	them”,	
    just	“them”	–	for	masculine	or	mixed	gender,	no?	So,	if	you	want	to	say,	We	see	
    them,	masculine	or	mixed	genders?		
	
S:	 Τους	δούμε	[tus	dhúme].		
	
T:	 But	now	it’s	just,	We	see	them,	no?	So,	would	you	use	δούμε	[dhúme],	the	closed	
    version?		
	
S:	 Ah.	Τους	βλέπουμε	[tus	vlépume].		
	
T:	 Τους	βλέπουμε.	No?	I	have	to	see	them.		
	


                                                                                         194
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	δω	[prépi	na	tus	dho].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πρέπει	να	τους	δω.	I	have	to	see	them,	and	we	mean	a	female	group?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	δω	[prépi	na	tus	dho].		
	
T:	 Is	it	see	“them”	or	“to	them”?		
	
S:	 Ah,	okay.	Πρέπει	να	τις	δω	[prépi	na	tis	dho].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	δω.	But,	I	have	to	tell	them,	and	this	works	for	both	masculine	and	
    feminine?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	πω	[prépi	na	tus	po].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	πω.	Πρέπει	να	τους	το	πω	[prépi	na	tus	to	po],	depending	on	the	
    context.	What	was	the	word	for	something?

T:	 Κάτι.	I	have	to	leave	them	something.

T:	 Very	 good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 τους	 αφήσω	 κάτι.	 And	 this	 works	 for	 masculine	 and

Teacher:	What	was,	I	have	to,	or	It	is	necessary?		
	
Student:	Πρέπει	[prépi].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει.	 Good.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 We	 have	 to	 eat	 them?	 And	 let’s	 talk	 about	
    neuter	“them”.	We	have	to	eat	them.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τα	φάμε	[prépi	na	ta	fáme].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τα	φάμε.	And	if	you	meant	masculine	things?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	φάμε	[prépi	na	tus	fáme].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πρέπει	να	τους	φάμε.	So	τους		[tus],	the	plural	of	του	[tu],	works	for	
    “to	 them”,	 but	 also	 just	 plain	 old	 “them”,	 for	 masculine.	 Πρέπει	 να	 τους	 φάμε.	
    And	if	we	meant	feminine	things?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	φάμε	[prépi	na	tis	fáme].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τις	φάμε.	Very	good.	So	let’s	say	something	like,	We	have	to	eat	them	
    quickly	because	they	will	get	cold.	So,	We	have	to	eat	them.	You	can	choose	the	
    gender.		
	
S:	 Okay.	Πρέπει	να	τους	φάμε	[prépi	na	tus	fáme].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	φάμε.	“Quickly”	is	γρήγορα	[ghríghora].		
	
S:	 Γρήγορα.		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 we	 have	 the	 [gh]	 sound	 with	 both	 of	 those	 G’s	 there.	 Γρήγορα	
    [ghríghora],	 γρήγορα.	 And	 you	 may	 be	 familiar	 with	 the	 name,	 “Gregory”	 or	
    Γρηγόρης	 in	 Greek,	 and	 this	 is	 related	 to	 the	 meanings,	 of	 like,	 wakefulness	 and	
    speed	and	quickness.	So	we	have	γρήγορα	[ghríghora],	“quickly”.	So,	We	have	to	
    eat	them	quickly.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	φάμε	γρήγορα	[prépi	na	tus	fáme	ghríghora].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	φάμε	γρήγορα.	“Because”,	we	could	have,	for	what.		
	
S:	 Γιατί	[yatí].		
	
T:	 Γιατί.	We	could	use,	for	what,	which	is	most	common	like	“why”.	We	could	also	
    use	επειδή	[epidhí],	for	“because”.	Επειδή.		
	
S:	 Επειδή.		


                                                                                             196
	
T:	 They	will	get	cold.	Do	you	remember	the	word	for	cold?		
	
S:	 Κρύο	[krío].		
	
T:	 Κρύο.	Very	good.	Κρύο.	And	do	you	remember	how	we	turned	this	into	a	verb,	to	
    get	cold?		
	
S:	 Κρυώνω	[krióno].		
	
T:	 Κρυώνω.	Very	good.	Κρυώνω.	So	now	we	can	say,	They	will	get	cold.		
	
S:	 Θα	κρυώνουν	[tha	kriónun].		
	
T:	 That	 means,	 They	 will	 be	 getting	 cold.	 We	 might	 use	 this	 in	 some	 context,	 but	
    here,	I	think	if	we’re	saying,	you	know,	Let’s	eat	them	quickly;	they	will	get	cold.	
    It’s	more	like	a	closed	element	of	time	that	you’re	referring	to,	no?	That	thing	that	
    you	don’t	want	to	happen,	that	they	get	cold.		
	
S:	 Θα	κρυώσουν	[tha	kriósun].		
	
T:	 Θα	κρυώσουν.	Very	good.	We	have	the	N	to	S	there	for	the	closed	version.	Πρέπει	
    να	 τους	 φάμε/τα	 φάμε/τις	 φάμε	 γρήγορα,	 γιατί/επειδή	 θα	 κρυώσουν/θα	
    κρυώσουνε	 [prépi	 na	 tus	 fáme/ta	 fáme/tis	 fáme	 ghríghora,	 yatí/epidhí	 tha	
    kriósun/tha	 kriósune].	 Very	 good.	 So,	 generally	 speaking,	 to	 get	 our	 closed	
    version,	no,	of	the	verb,	we	go	to	an	S	sound,	be	it	[ks],	[ps]	or	just	[s],	no,	all	of	
    which	is	one	letter:	KS	[ks]	is	one	letter	(Ξ/ξ),	PS	[ps]	is	one	letter	(Ψ/ψ),	and	then	
    of	course	S	[s]	is	also	just	one	letter	(Σ/σ).	So,	for	example,	we	had	παίζω	[pézo],	“I	
    play”,	to	παίξω	[pékso];	αλλάζω	[alázo],	“I	change”,	to	αλλάξω	[alákso];	δουλεύω	
    [dhulévo],	“I	work”,	to	δουλέψω	[dhulépso];	αρχίζω	[archízo],	“I	start”,	to	αρχίσω	
    [archíso];	 αγοράζω	 [aghorázo]	 to	 αγοράσω	 [aghoráso].	 But,	 also	 as	 we’ve	 seen,	
    anything	can	happen,	no?	We	go	from	λέω	[léo]	to	πω	[po],	from	τρώω	[tróo]	to	
    φάω	[fao],	from	βλέπω	[vlépo]	to	δω	[dho].	What	was,	I	stay?		
	
S:	 Μένω	[méno].		
	
T:	 Μένω.	Μένω,	in	its	closed	form,	becomes	μείνω	[míno].	Μείνω.		
	
S:	 Μείνω.		
	
T:	 M	-	I	(ει)	-	Ν	-	Ο	(ω).	But	not	περιμένω	[periméno].	Περιμένω	doesn’t	change.	So,	I	
    will	wait?		
	
S:	 Θα	περιμένω	[tha	periméno].		
	
T:	 Θα	περιμένω.	But,	I	will	stay?		
	


                                                                                           197
S:	 Θα	μείνω	[tha	míno].		
	
T:	 Θα	μείνω.	If	you	want	to	ask	someone	if	they	have	somewhere	to	stay,	you	could	
    just	ask,	Do	you	have	where	to	stay?	What	was	the	word	for,	where?		
	
S:	 Πού	[pu].		
	
T:	 So,	Do	you	have	where	to	stay?		
	
S:	 Έχεις	πού	να	μείνεις;	[échis	pu	na	mínis?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχεις	πού	να	μείνεις;	Good.	Shall	we	stay	here?		
	
S:	 Να	μείνουμε	εδώ;	[na	mínume	edhó?].		
	
T:	 Να	μείνουμε	εδώ;	Let’s	stay	here.		
	
S:	 Να	μείνουμε	εδώ	[na	mínume	edhó].		
	
T:	 Να	μείνουμε	εδώ.	Or	…	?		
	
S:	 Ας	μείνουμε	εδώ	[as	mínume	edhó].		
	
T:	 Ας	 μείνουμε	 εδώ.	 Good.	 So	 this	 μένω	 [méno]	 to	 μείνω	 [míno]	 change	 is	 quite	
    interesting,	because,	as	we	saw,	another	sub-pattern	that	we	had	was	losing	the	
    syllable	 with	 N	 in	 the	 closed	 form,	 no?	 Like	 μαθαίνω	 [mathéno],	 “I	 learn”,	 and	
    μάθω	 [mátho];	 καταλαβαίνω	 [katalavéno],	 “I	 understand”	 and	 καταλάβω	
    [katalávo];	 κατεβαίνω	 [katevéno]	 and	 κατέβω	 [katevó],	 “I	 go	 down”.	 Κατεβαίνω	
    and	 κατέβω.	 Φέρνω	 [férno],	 φέρω	 [féro],	 “I	 bring”.	 So	 we	 saw	 this	 pattern	 of	
    losing	the	N,	and	these	verbs	becoming	shorter.	But	μένω	[méno]	didn’t	want	to	
    just	 become	 μω	 [mο],	 no?	 Μένω	 to	 mείνω	 [míno].	 Στέλνω	 [stélno],	 στέλνω,	
    στέλνω,	“I	send”,	does	both	of	these	things	in	its	closed	form.	It	loses	the	N	and	
    the	E	[e]	turns	to	an	I	[i].	So,	στέλνω	[stélno],	“I	send”,	in	its	closed	version,	how	
    would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Στείλω	[stílo].		
	
T:	 Στείλω.	Very	good.	I	will	send	him	it	tomorrow.	I	will	send	him	it	tomorrow.		
	
S:	 Θα	του	στείλω	...	θα	του	το	στείλω	αύριο	[tha	tu	stílo	…	tha	tu	to	stílo	ávrio].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θα	 του	 το	 στείλω	 αύριο.	 Very	 good.	 So	 when	 we	 have	 him/it,	 the	
    person	 one	 goes	 first,	 no,	 then	 we	 have	 “του	 το”	 [tu	 to].	 So	 here	 in	 English	 we	
    don’t	say,	“send	it	to	him”	if	we	say	“I	will	send	him	it”,	no?	We	can	say	either,	“I	
    will	 send	 it	 to	 him”,	 “I	 will	 send	 him	 it”.	 So	 we’re	 not	 looking	 for	 direct	
    translations,	 no?	 We’re	 looking	 for	 the	 meaning,	 the	 overall	 meaning.	 Am	 I	
    sending	him?	Am	I	going	to	put	him	in	a	box	and	send	him?	Or,	like,	going	to	send	


                                                                                               198
   to	him,	or	for	him.	Θα	του	το	στείλω	αύριο.	Στέλνω	[stélno],	actually,	we	can	find	
   this	in	English.	“Apostle”.	An	apostle	is	από-στελ	[apó-stel],	στέλνω,	no,	like	“from	
   sending”	 –	 the	 messenger,	 no,	 like	 the	 religious	 messenger.	 From	 “sending”.	
   Actually,	 as	 you’re	 a	 native	 German	 speaker,	 stellen	 is	 from	 the	 same	 root,	 “to	
   put”,	in	German.	I	will	send	you	something.		
	
S:	 Θα	σου	στείλω	κάτι	[tha	su	stílo	káti].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	σου	στείλω	κάτι.	So	by	now	we	are	very	well	versed,	no,	in	finding	
    our	alternative	version	of	the	verb,	finding	our	closed	form	of	the	verb.	And	just	
    like	we	want	to	get	the	gender	of	a	noun,	when	we	come	across	it,	when	we	come	
    across	a	verb,	we	also	want	to	try	to	get	the	closed	version	of	it,	the	alternative	
    version,	 when	 we	 come	 across	 it.	 Unfortunately,	 they’re	 not	 included	 in	
    dictionaries,	 and	 we	 will	 work	 on	 some	 vocabulary	 cards	 that	 will	 include	 them,	
    which	might	be	ready	by	the	time	you	hear	this,	but	you	will	also	want	to	be	able	
    to	get	it	by	yourself,	no?	So,	how?	If	you’re	speaking	with	somebody,	imagine	you	
    ask	 for,	 or	 you	 come	 across	 the	 verb	 στέλνω	 [stélno],	 “I	 send”,	 and	 you	 decide	
    that	 you’d	 like	 this	 verb	 in	 your	 vocabulary	 bank	 –	 you	 want	 to	 keep	 this.	 So	
    you’re	going	to	try	to	find	out	what	is	the	closed	version,	too,	so	that	you	are	free	
    to	use	this	verb,	no?	So	you	can	ask	a	native:	you	go	ah,	okay,	“στέλνω”,	and	“θα	
    στ	 ...”	 [stélno,	 tha	 st	 …],	 and	 they	 will	 understand,	 and	 they	 will	 say,	 θα	 στείλω	
    [tha	stílo],	no?	They	will	understand	what	you’re	asking.	Of	course	you	could	also	
    have	 θα	 στέλνω	 [tha	 stélno],	 no,	 but	 most	 of	 the	 time,	 this	 will	 trigger	 στείλω	
    [stílo],	if	you	say	“θα	...	”	[tha	…],	without	any	context.	You	could	also	try	to	trick	
    an	 online	 translator,	 into	 giving	 you	 the	 other	 verb	 form,	 although	 it	 might	 give	
    you	 a	 random	 version	 of	 it	 that	 doesn’t	 make	 sense	 in	 the	 sentence	 that	 you’re	
    putting,	no?	But	you	can	put	“I	will”	or	“[I]	want”	in	the	verb	that	you	want	in	the	
    translator,	to	try	to	see	if	it	gives	you	some	alternative	form.	But	be	careful,	there.

T:	 So,	 if	 you	 say,	 for	 example,	 We	 have	 to	 put	 salt	 on	 it.	 Now,	 let’s	 imagine	 it’s	 a	
    masculine	 “on	 it”.	 We	 wouldn’t	 say	 τον	 [ton],	 because	 that	 would	 mean	 that

S:	 Πρέπει	να	τους	βάλουμε	αλάτι	[prépi	na	tus	válume	aláti].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τους	[tus]	for	masculine	and	for	feminine.	And	for	neuter	as	well,	no?

T:	 Very	good.	Πότε	θα	το	στείλεις;	So	we	have	πότε	[póte],	“when”,	and	τότε	[tóte].	
    Τότε	is	“then”.	But	then,	in	the	sense	of	time,	no?	Like,	“by	then”.	For	example,	
    “by	then”	is	μέχρι	τότε	[mékhri	tote].	“By	then”	or	“until	then”.	Μέχρι	τότε.

    What	was	the	word	for,	for?		
	
S:	 Για	[ya].		
	
T:	 Για.	Good.	Για	να	[ya	na],	για	να,	is	“so”,	“so	that”,	no?	In	the	sense	of,	I	will	send	
    it	to	you	so	that	you	see	it.	No?	There	you	can	use	για	να	,	“for	na”.	So,	I	will	send

S:	 Για	να	τα	στείλουν	[ya	na	ta	stílun].	Για	να	τα	στείλουν.		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Για	 να	 τα	 στείλουν.	 Τα	 έχω	 αφήσει	 εκεί	 για	 να	 τα	 στείλουν	 [ta	 ékho	
    afísi	ekí	ya	na	ta	stílun].	Good.	So	we	have,	για	να	[ya	na],	“for	na”,	for	“so”	or	“so	
    that”,	and	you	might	actually	hear	this	in	Greek	speakers	in	English,	no?	I’m	sure	if	
    you	 spend	 time	 with	 Greek	 speakers	 that	 have	 learnt	 English,	 you’ll	 hear	 very	
    often,	“I’ve	left	them	there	for	that	you	send	them”,	no?	So	actually	you	can	use	
    these	kinds	of	errors	that	Greek	speakers	make	in	English,	to	be	reminded	of,	or	to	
    learn	 something	 new	 about,	 the	 structure	 in	 Greek.	 If	 you	 hear	 a	 few	 native	
    speakers	making	the	same	error,	you	can	think,	oh	okay,	so	it’s	said	that	way	in	
    Greek.	And	you	also	will	become	more	conscious	of	the	errors	you	might	make	in	
    Greek,	that	come	from	English	or	whatever	other	language	you	speak.

Teacher:	If	you	want	to	say	something	like,	“I	haven’t	done	it	in	two	years”,	we	say	
    this	 in	 a	 slightly	 different	 way	 in	 Greek.	 In	 Greek,	 we	 say,	 “I	 have	 two	 years,	 να	
    [na],	I	do	it.”	So,	the	main	thing	to	notice	here	is	that	there’s	no	negative,	no,	like	
    in	 English:	 “I	 haven’t	 done	 it	 in	 two	 years”,	 as	 opposed	 to	 Greek,	 “I	 have	 two	
    years,	να,	I	do	it.”	What	was	the	word	for,	day?		
	
Student:	Μέρα	[méra].		
	
T:	 Μέρα.	 Good.	 Like	 in,	 καλημέρα	 [kaliméra],	 “good	 day”,	 or	 like	 in	 the	 English,	
    “ephemeral”;	 ephemeral,	 this	 means,	 you	 know,	 something	 that	 is	 just	 passing,	
    no,	that	doesn’t	last	very	long.	And	there	you	have,	μέρα	[méra]	inside.	And,	the	
    day?		
	
S:	 H	μέρα	[i	méra].		
	
T:	 H	μέρα.	Good.	It’s	feminine.	And,	the	days?		
	
S:	 Οι	μέρες	[i	méres].		
	
T:	 Οι	 μέρες.	 Good.	 And	 this	 [i]	 is	 spelt	 like	 with	 OI,	 like	 with	 the	 όμικρον,	 γιώτα	
    [ómikron,	yióta]	(οι),	and	that	OI	just	gives	us	the	sound	[i].	Οι	μέρες.	“I	cook”,	is	
    μαγειρεύω	[mayirévo].	Μαγειρεύω.		
	
S:	 Μαγειρεύω.		
	
T:	 The	 letter	 there	 that	 makes	 [y]	 is	 the	 same	 as	 the	 [gh]	 (γ)	 that	 we	 saw	 in	 εγώ	
    [eghó],	the	word	for	“I”,	that	we	saw	in	γρήγορα	[ghríghora]	–	“quickly”.	But	when	
    we	have	an	[i]	or	an	[e]	sound	following	that	[gh],	it	gets	softened	to	a	Y	[y]	sound,	
    like	in	μαγειρεύω	[mayirévo].	But	that’s	written	with	γάμα	[gáma]	(γ),	the	same	as	
    εγώ	[eghó],	which	in	the	printed	Greek,	actually	looks	like	a	Y/y.	Handwritten,	you	
    kind	of	make	a	loop,	but	in	the	typed	Greek	it	often	just	looks	like	a	Y,	like	a	kind	
    of	capital	Y,	but	going	below	the	line	a	bit	–	this	γάμα	[gáma].	So,	μαγειρεύω	is,	“I	
    cook”.	What	do	you	think	the	closed	version	might	be?		
	
S:	 Μαγειρέψω	[mayirépso].		
	
T:	 Μαγειρέψω.	 It	 is	 like	 δουλεύω	 [dhulévo],	 “I	 work”,	 δουλέψω	 [dhulépso];	 like	
    ταξιδεύω	 [taksidhévo],	 “I	 travel”,	 ταξιδέψω	 [taksidhépso].	 Μαγειρεύω,	
    μαγειρέψω	[mayirévo,	mayirépso].	So,	I	haven’t	cooked	for	days,	you	will	say,	“I	
    have	days,	να	[na],	I	cook”.	So	the	first	bit	is,	I	have	days.		
	
S:	 Έχω	μέρες	[ékho	méres].		
	
T:	 Έχω	μέρες,	να,	I	cook.	So,	we	have,	να,	and	then	we	have,	I	cook.	So,	we	have	to	
    make	a	decision	about,	I	cook.		


                                                                                                 204
	
S:	 Έχω	μέρες	να	μαγειρεύω	[ékho	méres	na	mayirévo].		
	
T:	 Why	“μαγειρεύω”?		
	
S:	 Because	it’s	a	long	time	since	…		
	
T:	 But	 you	 must	 think	 about,	 rather	 than	 the	 meaning	 of	 the	 whole	 phrase,	 that	
    specific	 bit	 –	 what	 it	 refers	 to.	 And	 that	 specific	 bit	 refers	 to	 just	 the	 act	 of	
    cooking.		
	
S:	 Ah	 …	 since	 I	 cooked,	 not	 since	 I	 have	 been	 cooking.	 Okay,	 so,	 Έχω	 μέρες	 να	
    μαγειρέψω	[ékho	méres	na	mayirépso].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Έχω	 μέρες	 να	 μαγειρέψω.	 So,	 έχω	 μέρες,	 is	 referring	 to	 something	
    ongoing,	but,	να	μαγειρέψω,	isn’t.	It’s	just	referring	to	you	cooking,	like	a	closed	
    event.	Έχω	μέρες	να	μαγειρέψω	(I	haven’t	cooked	for	days).	I	haven’t	cooked	for	
    him	for	days.	I	have	days,	να,	I	cook	for	him.		
	
S:	 Έχω	μέρες	να	τον	μαγειρέψω	…	να	του	μαγειρέψω	[ékho	méres	na	ton	mayirépso	
    …	ékho	méres	na	tu	mayirépso].		
	
T:	 What	would	it	mean	if	you	said,	Έχω	μέρες	να	τον	μαγειρέψω?		
	
S:	 It’s,	Since	I	cooked	him.		
	
T:	 Since	 I	 cooked	 him.	 Since	 I	 put	 him	 in	 the	 oven.	 Or,	 as	 we	 would	 probably	
    understand,	a	masculine	“it”.	No?	Because	it	would	make	more	sense;	our	mind	
    would	go	there	first.	So,	του	[tu],	because	it’s	cook,	“for	him”,	“to	him”,	no?	Έχω	
    μέρες	να	του	μαγειρέψω.	I	haven’t	cooked	for	them	for	days.		
	
S:	 Έχω	μέρες	να	τους	μαγειρέψω	[ékho	méres	na	tus	mayirépso].		
	
T:	 Έχω	μέρες	να	τους	μαγειρέψω.	Very	good.	I	haven’t	seen	them	for	days.		
	
S:	 Έχω	μέρες	να	τους	δω	[ékho	méres	na	tus	dho].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	μέρες	να	τους	δω.	So	this	refers	to	a	masculine	or	a	mixed	group.	
    How	about,	I	haven’t	seen	them	for	days,	and	we	mean	women?		
	
S:	 Έχω	μέρες	να	τους	δω	...	να	τις	δω	[ékho	méres	na	tus	dho	…	na	tis	dho].		
	
T:	 Να	τις	δω	[na	tis	dho].		
	
S:	 Because	it’s	not	“to”	or	“for”…		
	




                                                                                                205
T:	 Very	 good.	 So,	 for	 “them”,	 generally	 we	 have	 a	 difference:	 we	 have	 τις	 [tis]	 for	
    feminine,	 and	 τους	 [tus]	 for	 masculine	 or	 mixed.	 But	 when	 it’s	 “to	 them”,	 “for	
    them”,	we	have	τους	[tus]	for	everybody.	So,	Έχω	μέρες	να	τις	δω	[ékho	méres	na	
    na	tis	dho].	So	that’s,	I	haven’t	seen	them	for	days.	But	just,	I	haven’t	seen	them?		
	
S:	 Δεν	τους	έχω	δει	[dhen	tus	ékho	dhi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	τους,	or	τις	(if	we	mean	females),	έχω	δει.	So,	very	different,	the	
    structure	between,	Έχω	μέρες	να	τους	δω	[ékho	méres	na	tus	dho],		Δεν	τους	έχω	
    δει	 [dhen	 tus	 ékho	 dhi].	 Very	 big	 difference	 between,	 I	 haven’t	 seen	 them	 for	
    days,	and	just,	I	haven’t	seen	them.	I	haven’t	seen	them	here	for	days?		
	
S:	 Έχω	μέρες	να	τους	δω	εδώ	[ékho	méres	na	na	tus	dho	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	μέρες	να	τους	δω	εδώ.	The	word	for	“seven”	is	εφτά	[eftá].	Εφτά.		
	
S:	 Εφτά.		
	
T:	 Εφτά.	 And	 the	 word	 for	 “week”,	 is	 εβδομάδα	 [evdhomádha].	 Εβδομάδα.	 So	 in	
    εφτά	[eftá],	we	have	an	F	sound,	but	in	εβδομάδα	[evdhomádha],	we	have	[ev],	
    like	 a	 V.	 Εβδομάδα,	 a	 week.	 But	 it’s	 related,	 no?	 We	 have	 seven,	 εφτά,	 and	
    εβδομάδα,	seven	days,	a	week.	What’s	the	gender	of,	εβδομάδα?		
	
S:	 H	[i].	It’s	feminine.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	H	εβδομάδα	[i	evdhomádha].	So,	the	weeks,	would	be?		
	
S:	 Οι	εβδομάδες	[i	evdhomádhes].		
	
T:	 Οι	εβδομάδες.	Very	good.	“Movie”	was	ταινία	[tenía].	Ταινία.	A	movie?		
	
S:	 Μία	ταινία	[mía	tenía].		
	
T:	 Good.	 It’s	 feminine.	 Μία	 ταινία.	 Μία	 ταινία.	 I	 haven’t	 seen	 a	 movie	 for	 weeks.	 I	
    have	weeks,	να	[na],	I	see	a	movie.		
	
S:	 Έχω	εβδομάδες	να	δω	μία	ταινία	[ékho	evdhomádhes	na	dho	mía	tenía].		
	
T:	 Έχω	εβδομάδες	να	δω	μία	ταινία.	Or	more	commonly,	we	would	probably	leave	
    out	the	“μία”.	Έχω	εβδομάδες	να	δω	ταινία	[ékho	evdhomádhes	na	dho	tenía].	“A	
    year”,	is	ένας	χρόνος	[énas	khrónos].	Ένας	χρόνος.		
	
S:	 Ένας	χρόνος.		
	
T:	 Ο	 χρόνος	 [o	 khrónos]	 actually	 can	 mean	 time,	 generally,	 which	 is	 where	 we	 get	
    “chrononlogical”	 from,	 no?	 But	 with,	 ένας	 χρόνος,	 we	 get	 “a	 year”.	 Μία	 χρονιά	
    [mía	 khroniá],	 which	 also	 exists,	 also	 means,	 “a	 year”,	 μία	 χρονιά.	 And	 it’s	 used	


                                                                                              206
   more,	 like,	 in	 expressions,	 like	 in,	 καλή	 χρονιά	 [kalí	 khroniá],	 “good	 year”,	 or	
   “Happy	 New	 Year”,	 or	 σχολική	 χρονιά	 [skholikí	 khroniá],	 “a	 school	 year”	 –	 or	 a	
   good	 year	 for	 wine,	 or	 something	 like	 that,	 you	 would	 use	 χρονιά	 [khroniá].	
   Otherwise,	you	have	ένας	χρόνος	[énas	khrónos],	for	“a	year”.		
	
S:	 Ένας	χρόνος.		
	
T:	 Ένας	 χρόνος.	 Good.	 As	 if	 it	 wasn’t	 strange	 enough	 to	 have	 two	 ways	 of	 saying	
    “year”,	ένας	χρόνος	[énas	khrónos],	and	μία	χρονιά	[mía	khroniá],	both	masculine	
    and	feminine,	no,	the	plural	of,	ένας	χρόνος	is,	τα	χρόνια	[ta	khrónia].		
	
S:	 Tα	χρόνια.		
	
T:	 Tα	χρόνια.	So,	it’s	like	χρονιά	[khroniá],	but	the	accent’s	at	the	beginning,	χρόνια	
    [khrónia],	and	it	becomes	neuter	suddenly.	Tα	χρόνια.		
	
S:	 Tα	χρόνια.		
	
T:	 And	there’s	even	more	ways	of	talking	about	a	year	in	Greek.	You	could	have,	το	
    έτος	[to	étos],	the	plural	of	which	is,	τα	έτη	[ta	éti].	And	this	is	…	this	is	used	less,	
    but	 in	 some	 quite	 common	 expressions	 like,	 ένα	 ακαδημαϊκό	 έτος	 [éna	
    acadhimaikó	étos],	“one	academic	year”.	And	it’s	interesting	that	Greek	does	this,	
    because	 Greek	 is	 a	 language	 really	 concerned	 about	 time.	 As	 I	 mentioned,	
    different	languages	care	about	different	things;	they	mark	different	things	in	their	
    grammar.	 And	 we	 see	 how	 Greek	 cares	 very	 much	 about	 time,	 no?	 We	 have	 an	
    open	and	a	closed	version	for	the	verbs,	and	we	have	to	think	about	when	to	use	
    that.	And	this	is	a	recurring	feature	of	the	language	and	the	culture	as	well,	if	you	
    look	at	ancient	Greek	philosophers	going	on	a	lot	about	time	and	different	ways	of	
    seeing	 time.	 So	 …	 so	 this	 odd	 situation,	 I	 think,	 reflects	 very	 well	 the	 way	 the	
    culture	views	elements	of	time	and	the	langauge.	So,	we	have,	ένας	χρόνος	[énas	
    khrónos],	 “a	 year”,	 and,	 χρόνια	 [khrónia]	 for	 “years”.	 So	 if	 you	 were	 to	 say,	 I	
    haven’t	seen	a	movie	for	years?	I	have	years,	να	[na],	I	see	a	movie.		
	
S:	 Έχω	χρόνια	να	δω	ταινία	[ékho	khrónia	na	dho	tenía].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	χρόνια	να	δω	ταινία.	Η	δουλειά	[i	dhuliá]	was	“the	work”,	or	a	job,	
    “the	job”.	Η	δουλειά.	And,	I	work	–	how	do	we	get	the	verb	from,	δουλειά?	Do	
    you	remember?		
	
S:	 Δουλεύω	[dhulévo].		
	
T:	 Δουλεύω.	Good.	Δουλεύω.	I	haven’t	worked	for	seven	years.	What	is,	seven?		
	
S:	 Εφτά	[eftá].		
	
T:	 Εφτά.	So,	I	have	seven	years,	να	[na],	I	work?		
	


                                                                                               207

    [na	dhulépso].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	εφτά	χρόνια	να	δουλέψω.	Οχτώ	[okhtó]	or	οκτώ	[októ],	you	can	
    hear	either:	οχτώ,	οκτώ,	like	with	a	[ch]	(χ),	or	with	the	K	(κ).		
	
S:	 Οχτώ.		
	
T:	 Means	“eight”.		
	
S:	 Οχτώ.		
	
T:	 And	this	is	like	“October”,	which	of	course	is	the	tenth	month,	but	the	calendar	…		
    our	calendar	used	to	have	ten	months	and	October	was	the	eighth.	Οχτώ,	number	
    eight.	So,	you	could	say,	They	haven’t	worked	in	eight	years.		
	
S:	 Έχουν	οχτώ	χρόνια	να	δουλέψουν	[ékhun	okhtó	khrónia	na	dhulépsun].

Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	time	or,	a	year?		
	
Student:	Χρόνος	[khrónos].		
	
T:	 Χρόνος.	And	we	also	said	that,	η	χρονιά	[i	khroniá]	can	also	be	a	year,	like	in,	καλή	
    χρονιά	[kalí	khroniá],	“good	year”,	σχολική	χρονιά	[skholikí	khroniá],	the	“school	
    year”.	And,	ο	χρόνος	[o	khrónos],	“the	year”,	the	most	common	word	for	“year”,	
    when	 we’re	 talking	 about	 a	 period	 of	 time,	 no,	 had	 a	 very	 strange	 plural.	 What	
    was	the	plural	of,	χρόνος	[khrónos]?		
	
S:	 Τα	χρονιά	[ta	khroniá].		
	
T:	 Τα	χρόνια	[ta	khrónia].	Good.		
	
S:	 Τα	χρόνια.		
	
T:	 And	we	said	how	this	is	connected	to	“chronological”,	no?	That	χρόνος	[khrónos]	
    can	 also	 mean	 time,	 generally,	 and	 this	 is	 where	 we	 get	 “chronological”	 from	 in	
    English.	How	would	you	say,	I	haven’t	seen	you	for	years?		
	
S:	 Έχω	χρόνια	να	σε	δω	[ékho	khrónia	na	se	dho].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	χρόνια	να	σε	δω.	There’s	also	another	expression	to	express	the	
    same	idea,	no,	like,	I	haven’t	done	something	for	an	amount	of	time.	So,	instead	
    of,	I	have	years,	να	[na],	I	see	you,	we	might	also	say,	I	haven’t	seen	you,	εδώ	και	
    χρόνια	[edhó	ke	khrónia]	(“here	and	years”).	So,	that’s	not	saying,	I	haven’t	seen	
    you	 here,	 no?	 This	 is	 an	 expression	 (εδώ	 και	 [edhó	 ke]),	 and	 then	 you	 put	 the	
    amount	of	time,	“here	and”.	So,	a	little	bit	like	“from	here”,	no,	or	something	like	
    this.	 Χρόνια	 [khrónia].	 So,	 again,	 a	 bit	 odd,	 because	 it’s	 an	 expression.	 So,	 using	
    this,	we	will	say,	I	haven’t	seen	you	here	and	years.		
	
S:	 Σε	έχω	δει	εδώ	και	χρόνια	[se	ékho	dhi	edhó	ke	krónia].

T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	σε	έχω	δει	εδώ	και	χρόνια.	And	here	we	have	the	negative,	no,	in	
    this	 construction.	 So,	 often	 in	 language	 there	 are	 many	 ways	 to	 say	 the	 same	
    thing,	 no?	 And	 it	 can	 depend	 on	 communal	 or	 individual	 preferences.	 So,	 a	
    communal	 preference	 is	 a	 dialect,	 no?	 Certain	 dialects,	 you	 will	 …	 you	 will	 see	
    different	preferences	in	different	places.	And	then	an	individual	preference	is	an	
    idiolect.	You	will	notice	how	people	have	ideolects,	and	in	certain	situations,	tend	
    to	choose	maybe	exclusively	one	way	of	saying	things	over	another.	We	all	have	
    our	individual	idiolect	as	well.	So,	we	saw	χρόνος	[khrónos],	and	we	said	how	it’s	
    related	 to	 “chronological”.	 When	 we	 have	 CH	 in	 English,	 and	 it	 gives	 us	 a	 [k]	
    sound,	like	a	K	sound	–	so	not	like	the	CH	[ch]	in,	“cheese”	or	“charity”,	no,	but	
    like	 in	 “school”	 or	 “chronological”	 –	 when	 we	 have	 that,	 that	 CH	 making	 a	 [k]	
    sound	 in	 English,	 it’s	 Greek.	 And	 this	 is	 the	 letter	 that	 looks	 like	 an	 X	 in	 Greek	
    (Χ/χ),	 no,	 like	 in	 έχω	 [ékho].	 Chronology	 –	 χρόνος	 [khrónos],	 which	 I	 should	
    mention	you	should	be	careful	not	to	confuse	with	a	K	in	some	Greek	fonts,	like	
    the	ones	used	in	the	dictionary.	This	X	(χ),	and	the	stylised	way	of	writing	the	K,	
    can	 look	 very	 similar.	 Σχολική	 χρονιά	 [skholikí	 khroniá],	 I	 mentioned,	 no,	 the	
    “school	year”.	So	again,	we	have	the	word	in	English,	“school”,	no,	CH	making	[k],	
    and	then	σχολείο	[skholío]	is	the	word	for	“school”	in	Greek.	Σχολείο.		
	
S:	 Σχολείο.		
	
T:	 And	then	in	this	way	where	we	use	it	like	an	adjective,	σχολική		[skholikí],	like	in,	
    “school	 year”,	 no,	 σχολική	 χρονιά	 [skholikí	 khroniá].	 “Psychology”,	 I	 mentioned	
    before	for	the	“-logy"	bit,	but	I	also	mentioned	it	was	something	like	the	science	
    of	 the	 soul,	 no?	 Ψυχή	 [psichí]	 is	 “soul”.	 Again	 “psycho”,	 we	 have	 the	 CH	 there	
    making	 a	 [k]	 sound.	 You	 might	 also	 hear	 in	 Greek,	 ψυχή	 μου	 [psichí	 mu].	 What	
    does	that	mean,	ψυχή	μου?		
	
S:	 My	soul.		
	
T:	 My	soul,	used	to	refer	to	somebody	affectionately,	no?	Ψυχή	μου	–	my	soul.	We	
    have	 “chromatic”	 in	 English,	 no?	 Like	 in	 musical	 scales,	 a	 chromatic	 scale	 is	 the	
    colourful	scale,	because	we	have	in	Greek,	χρώμα	[khróma].	Χρώμα,	which	is	the	
    “colour”.	Χρώμα.		
	
S:	 Χρώμα.	
	
T:	 Χρώμα.	How	would	you	make	that	plural?		
	
S:	 Χρώματα	[khrómata].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.	It’s	a	neuter	word,	ending	MA	(μα),	το	χρώμα,	τα	χρώματα	
    [to	khróma,	ta	khrómata].	Ήχος	[íkhos],	for	example,	means	“sound”.	If	we	replace	
    that	 [kh]	 with	 CH,	 you	 might	 find	 a	 word	 in	 English,	 if	 we	 imagine	 it	 with	 a	 CH.	
    Ήχος.	What	does	it	look	like	in	English?		
	
S:	 Echo.		


                                                                                                 210
	
T:	 Echo.	Good.	So	“echo”	is	just	the	Greek	word	for	sound.	Well,	actually,	in	Greek,	
    ήχος	[íkhos]	is	“sound”,	and	ηχώ	[ikhó]	is	“echo”,	which	is	fascinating,	because	it’s	
    like	 we	 move	 the	 accent,	 like	 an	 echo,	 no?	 Ήχος,	 ηχώ	 [íkhos,	 ikhó],	 and	 we	 get	
    “echo”.	“Character”,	character,	another	CH	there,	giving	us	[kh].	In	Greek	we	have	
    χαρακτήρας,	 which	 is	 actually	 connected	 to,	 “I	 engrave”,	 “I	 carve”,	 χαράζω	
    [kharázo].	Your	character	is	your	markings,	what’s	marked	you	in	your	life	is	your	
    character.	 That’s	 the	 idea	 behind	 that	 word.	 Χαράζει	 [kharázi]	 also	 means	 “the	
    break	of	dawn”.	So	χαράζω	[kharázo]	is	like,	you	know,	“engrave”,	“to	carve”,	or	
    maybe	 “to	 crack”.	 And	 χαράζει,	 it	 engraves,	 it	 cracks,	 is	 the	 break	 of	 dawn.	 The	
    word	for	“soon”,	was	σύντομα	[sídoma/síndoma].	Σύντομα.	So	you	could	say,	you	
    know,	It	will	…	the	dawn	will	break	soon.		
	
S:	 Θα	χαράζει	σύντομα	[tha	kharázi	síndoma].		
	
T:	 Okay,	this	would	mean	more	like,	you	know,	It’s	going	to	be	breaking	dawn	soon.	
    So	if	you	wanted	the,	“it	will”,	the	closed	version,	how	might	that	be?		
	
S:	 Ah.	Θα	χαράσει	[tha	kharási].		
	
T:	 Good.	That’s	a	good	guess,	no,	because	we	have,	for	example,	αγοράζω,	αγοράσω	
    [aghorázo,	aghoráso],	no?	Αρχίζω	[archizo],	“I	start”;	αρχίσω	[archiso].	But	here,	
    it’s,	 χαράζω	 [kharázo]	 to	 χαράξω	 [kharákso].	 Like,	 αλλάζω	 [alázo],	 “I	 change”;	
    αλλάξω	[alákso].	Like	παίζω	[pézo],	“I	play”;	παίξω	[pékso].	But	we	can	also	look	
    to	 the	 word	 in	 English	 that	 comes	 from	 the	 Greek,	 to	 get	 a	 guess	 towards	 the	
    closed	 version.	 So	 “character”,	 char-ac-ter,	 sounds	 like	 χαράξω	 [kharákso].	 And	
    you	 know,	 as	 you	 know,	 we	 generally	 have	 quite	 a	 few	 limited	 options	 for	 our	
    closed	 version:	 [s],	 [ks],	 [ps].	 We	 can	 look	 if	 the	 word	 we	 get	 from	 that	 sounds	
    something	like	[s],	[ps],	or	[ks].	We’ve	already	seen	this,	like	in	φέρνω	[férno],	“I	
    bring”,	 and	 φέρω	 [féro],	 no,	 the	 closed	 version,	 which	 is	 what	 we	 find	 in	 words	
    like	“transfer”.	So	often	we	make	up	a	vocabulary	from	the	closed	version	of	the	
    verb,	which	can	help	us	guess	it.	So,	Θα	χαράξει	σύντομα	[tha	kharáksi	sídoma].	
    My	name,	no,	“Mihalis”	(Μιχάλης)	[mikhális],	if	you	replace	that	χ	with	CH,	what	is	
    the	name	you	find	in	English?		
	
S:	 Michael.		
	
T:	 Michael.	 Of	 course,	 no?	 Which	 actually	 is	 from	 ancient	 Hebrew,	 meaning,	
    something	 like,	 “who	 is	 like	 God”,	 thought	 to	 be	 a	 rhetorical	 question,	
    necessitating	the	answer	like,	“no	one”,	no?	Who	is	like	God?	No	one.	Chameleon,	
    chamomile,	 no?	 “Chamomile”	 used	 to	 be	 spelt,	 “ch	 …”,	 although	 it’s	 not	 so	
    common	now.	These	are	built	of,	χώμα	[khóma],	meaning	ground,	or	soil.	The	first	
    bit,	 “cham”	 [kam],	 is	 actually	 χώμα.	 So	 “chameleon”,	 means	 like	 a	 ground	 lion,	
    actually,	or	a	dirt	lion,	or	something	like	this.	“Chamomile”	means	something	like	
    a	ground	apple.	Το	μήλο	[to	mílo]	in	Greek	is	an	“apple”,	which	is	actually	where	
    the	English	word,	“melon”	comes	from.	So	always	try	to	break	up	Greek	words	to	
    see	what	they’re	made	of,	or	words	in	English	you	notice	are	from	Greek,	either	


                                                                                               211
   from	 some	 part	 you	 recognise	 like	 “pedi”,	 “epi",	 or	 whatever.	 Or	 a	 CH	 sound	
   giving	us	[kh/ch],	or	like	the	PH	giving	us	[f],	like	in	phone,	τηλέφωνο	[tiléfono].	It’s	
   amazing	for	your	memory	and	just	for	general	digesting	of	vocabulary,	to	look	at	it	
   in	 this	 way.	 And	 if	 you	 speak	 other	 languages,	 try	 to	 cross	 that	 bridge	 too.	 For	
   example,	in	Spanish,	“chamomile”,	is	manzanilla,	literally	“little	apple”.	Or	even	in	
   Spanish	 sign	 language,	 the	 sign	 for	 “character”,	 which	 I	 mentioned	 was	 coming	
   from	χαράζω,	like	“to	mark”,	is	just	marking	at,	kind	of	scratching	the	hand,	you	
   know.	 So	 you	 find	 the	 same	 idea	 there	 as	 well.	 “Choreography”,	 choreography,	
   means	writing	with	dance.	We’ve	already	seen	γράφω	[ghráfo],	“I	write”,	with	the	
   PH/F	connection,	no,	γράφει,	γράφω	[ghráfi,	ghráfo].	And	χορεύω	[khorévo]	is,	“I	
   dance”.	Xορεύω.		
	
S:	 Xορεύω.		
	
T:	 What	might	be	the	closed	version	of,	χορεύω?		
	
S:	 Χορέψω	[khorépso].		
	
T:	 Χορέψω.	I	haven’t	danced	for	years?		
	
S:	 Έχω	χρόνια	να	χορέψω	[ékho	khrónia	va	khorépso].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	χρόνια	να	χορέψω.	Δεν	έχω	χορέψει	εδώ	και	χρόνια	[dhen	ékho	
    khorépsi	edhó	ke	khrónia].	So	this	is	a	way	of	looking	at	vocabulary.	Whenever	we	
    get	 the	 opportunity	 to,	 we	 want	 to	 pick	 things	 apart,	 rather	 than	 trying	 to	
    memorise	them.	Even	if	we	see	a	word	that	we	don’t	understand,	we	might	see	
    which	bits	it’s	built	of,	which	may	allow	us	in	the	context	to	guess	the	meaning	of	
    the	word.	And	even	if	it	doesn’t,	we’ve	revised	those	little	bits,	you	know,	that	we	
    recognise,	and	brought	them	closer	to	the	surface.	So	that’s	the	way	we	want	to	
    approach	vocabulary,	especially	in	a	language	like	Greek,	where	the	vocabulary	is	
    long,	because	it’s	built	of	so	many	different	parts.

Teacher:	“Stomach”,	stomach,	again,	we	have	the	CH	giving	us	a	[k]	sound,	in	Greek	
    is	στομάχι	[stomáchi].	Στομάχι.		
	
Student:	Στομάχι.		
	
T:	 So	this	Χ	letter	(χ),	this	[kh/ch]	sound	is	pronounced	in	two	slightly	different	ways.	
    It’s	kind	of	soft	–	[ch]	–	when	it	has	an	E	or	an	I	after	it,	στομάχι,	and	then	hard	
    when	it	has	another	vowel	after	it,	like	in	έχω	[ékho],	and	also	if	it’s	followed	by	a	
    consonant	sound,	like	in	χρώμα	[khróma],	χρόνος	[khrónos].	Στομάχι	is	a	neuter	
    noun,	so	how	would	you	say,	my	stomach?		
	
S:	 Το	στομάχι	μου	[to	stomáchi	mu].		
	
T:	 Το	στομάχι	μου.	I	hurt	is,	πονάω	[ponáo].	Πονάω.	But	mostly	you	will	hear	it	as,	
    “It	 hurts”.	 For	 example,	 if	 you	 say,	 “My	 stomach	 hurts”,	 you	 will	 say	 it	 in	 Greek	
    just	like	in	English:	It	hurts,	my	stomach,	My	stomach,	it	hurts,	no?	So,	how	would	
    that	be,	from	πονάω?		
	
S:	 Πονάει	το	στομάχι	μου	[ponái	to	stomáchi	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Πονάει	 το	 στομάχι	 μου.	 Με	 πονάει	 το	 στομάχι	 μου	 [me	 ponái	 to	
    stomáchi	 mu].	 Στομάχι,	 “stomach”,	 actually	 comes	 from	 the	 word	 for	 “mouth”,	
    στόμα	[stóma],	“mouth”.		
	
S:	 Στόμα.		
	
T:	 So	 you	 have	 στόμα	 [stóma]	 for	 “mouth”,	 and	 στομάχι	 [stomáchi],	 “stomach”.	
    What	gender	is	στόμα,	do	you	think?		
	
S:	 Neuter?		
	
T:	 Yes,	 neuter,	 no?	 So	 it	 ends	 in	 A	 (α),	 but	 it’s	 not	 feminine.	 It’s	 MA	 (μα),	 like	
    πρόβλημα	[próvlima],	το	πρόβλημα.	It’s	a	neuter	word.	So,	το	στόμα	[to	stóma].	
    How	might	you	say,	the	mouths?		
	
S:	 Τα	στόματα	[ta	stómata].		
	
T:	 Τα	στόματα.	The	accent	doesn’t	move	when	we	add	the	τα	[ta]	when	we	have	a	
    short	word.	When	the	word	is	longer,	we	move	the	accent,	no:	μήνυμα,	μηνύματα	
    [mínima,	 minímata].	 But,	το	 χρώμα,	 τα	 χρώματα	[to	khróma,	ta	 khrómata],	“the	
    colour,	 the	 colours”;	 το	 στόμα,	 τα	 στόματα	 [to	 stóma,	 ta	 stómata],	 “the	 mouth,	
    the	mouths”.	So	here	with	these	shorter	nouns,	like	στόμα,	χρώμα,	we	don’t	need	
    to	move	the	accent	when	we	add	on	that	τα	for	the	plural.	My	mouth?		
	
S:	 Το	στόμα	μου	[to	stóma	mu].		


                                                                                                213
	
T:	 Το	στόμα	μου.	Your	mouth?		
	
S:	 Το	στόμα	σου	[to	stóma	su].		
	
T:	 Το	στόμα	σου.	His	mouth?	What	was,	to	him?		
	
S:	 Του	[tu].		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	his	mouth?		
	
S:	 Το	στόμα	του	[to	stóma	tu].		
	
T:	 Το	στόμα	του.	So	our	word	for,	“to	him”,	no,	we	can	also	use	for	possession.	Like,	
    “the	mouth	to	him”.	Το	στόμα	του.	Their	mouth?		
	
S:	 Το	στόμα	τους	[to	stóma	tus].		
	
T:	 Το	στόμα	τους.	Her	mouth?		
	
S:	 Το	στόμα	της	[to	stóma	tis].		
	
T:	 Το	 στόμα	 της.	 Very	 good.	 What	 was,	 I	 can?	 A	 verb	 that	 has	 the	 accent	 on	 the	
    ending.

S:	 Γιατί	το	στομάχι	του	πονάει	[yatí	to	stomáchi	tu	ponái].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Γιατί/επειδή	το	στομάχι	του	πονάει	[yatí/epidhí	to	stomáchi	tu	ponái],	
    πονάει	το	στομάχι	του.	Μόνος	[mónos],	μόνος,	means,	“alone”.	Μόνος.		
	
S:	 Μόνος.		
	
T:	 We	have	this	all	over	English.	We	have	“monopoly”,	which	is	like,	μόνος	πουλάω	
    [mónos	puláo],	“I	sell”.	So	it’s	like,	“alone	selling”,	no,	a	monopoly.	“Monotonous”	
    is	like,	you	know,	“one	tone”.	“Monogamy”,	single	marriage.	In	Greek,	a	one-way	
    street	 is	 μονόδρομος	 [monódhromos],	 a	 lone	 street.	 Mονόδρομος,	 a	 one-way	
    street.	What	is,	I	stay?		
	
S:	 Μένω	[méno].		
	
T:	 Μένω.	I	stay	alone?		
	
S:	 Μένω	μόνος	[méno	mónos].		
	
T:	 Μένω	μόνος.	And	for	females,	μένω	μόνη	[méno	móni].	And	you	could	also	say,	“I	
    stay	 by	 myself”,	 which	 would	 be,	 μένω	 μόνος	 μου	 [méno	 mónos	 mu].	 Μένω	
    μόνος	μου.	So	you	could	say,	like	in	English,	“I	stay	alone”,	μένω	μόνος,	or,	μένω	
    μόνος	μου	–	I	stay	by	myself.	If	you’re	a	female,	you	won’t	say,	μόνος	μου,	which	
    is	masculine,	but	…	?		
	
S:	 Μόνη	μου	[móni	mu].		
	
T:	 Μόνη	μου.		
	
S:	 Μόνη	μου.		
	
T:	 So	the	μου	[mu]	here	is	like	possessive,	no;	it’s	like	“my	own”.	Mόνος	μου,	μόνη	
    μου.	Do	you	stay	alone	–	by	yourself?	Let’s	talk	to	a	female.		
	
S:	 Μένεις	μόνη	σου;	[ménis	móni	su?].		
	
T:	 Μένεις	μόνη	σου;	Μόνη	σου	μένεις;	[móni	su	ménis?].	And	to	a	man?		
	
S:	 Μένεις	μόνος	σου;	[ménis	mónos	su?].		
	
T:	 Μένεις	μόνος	σου;	Good.	“Us”,	or	“to	us”,	was	μας	[mas].	Μας.		
	
S:	 Μας.

T:	 So,	if	we	say,	We	want	to	stay	by	ourselves.	We	want	to	stay	by	ourselves.	Let’s	
    start	from	the	first	bit,	We	want?		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	[thélume].		
	
T:	 To	stay?		
	
S:	 Να	μείνουμε	[na	mínume].		
	
T:	 Good.	By	ourselves.		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	να	μείνουμε	μόνοι	μας	[thélume	na	mínume	móni	mas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλουμε	να	μείνουμε	μόνοι	μας.	We	want	to	stay	by	ourselves.	What	
    if	we	were	females?		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	να	μείνουμε	μόνες	μας	[thélume	na	mínume	mónes	mas].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλουμε	να	μείνουμε	μόνες	μας.	And,	depending	on	the	context,	we	could	
    also	 have	 μένουμε	 [ménume],	 no?	 Maybe	 we’re	 talking	 about	 the	 general	
    situation.	Maybe	we	are	talking	about	the	arrangements	to	stay	somewhere,	you	
    know,	when	it’s	like	very	closed	and	concrete.	Depends	on	the	context.	What	was,	
    I	cook?		
	
S:	 Mαγειρεύω	[mayirévo].		
	
T:	 Mαγειρεύω.	I	can’t	cook	by	myself.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	μαγειρέψω	μόνος	μου	[dhen	boró	va	mayirépso	mónos	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Δεν	 μπορώ	 να	 μαγειρέψω	 μόνος	 μου.	 So	 this	 would	 refer	 to	 a	 specific	
    situation,	but	if	you	meant,	very	generally,	like,	“I’m	just,	you	know,	so	useless	in	
    the	kitchen.”	How	would	you	say	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	μαγειρεύω	μόνος	μου	[dhen	boró	va	mayirévo	mónos	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορώ	να	μαγειρεύω	μόνος	μου.	Or	if	you	were	a	female,	μόνη	
    μου	[móni	mu].	We	can’t	cook	by	ourselves.	Let’s	be	masculine	or	a	mixed	group.	
    We	can’t	cook	by	ourselves.		
	
S:	 Δεν	 μπορούμε	 να	 μαγειρεύουμε	 μόνοι	 μας	 [dhen	 borúme	 na	 mayirévume	 móni	
    mas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορούμε	να	μαγειρεύουμε	μόνοι	μας.	Maybe	you	are	a	couple,	
    and	you	are	talking	very	generally,	you	know,	“Us	as	a	couple,	we	are	useless	in

                                                                                      216
   μαγειρεύουμε/να	 μαγειρέψουμε	 μόνοι	 μας	 [dhen	 borúme	 na	 mayirévume/na

S:	 Μόνες	μας	[mónes	mas].		
	
T:	 Μόνες	μας.	Good.	He	can’t	cook	by	himself?		
	
S:	 Δεν	 μπορεί	 να	 μαγειρεύει	 μόνος	 …	 μόνος	 του	 [dhen	 borí	 na	 mayirévi	 mónos	 …

T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 μπορεί	 να	 μαγειρέψει/να	 μαγειρεύει	 μόνος	 του	 [dhen	 borí	 na

S:	 Δεν	 μπορούνε	 να	 μαγειρεύουν	 μόνους	 …	 μόνους	 τους	 [dhen	 borúne	 na	
    mayirévun	mónus	…	mónus	tus].		
	
T:	 Deal	with	each	bit	separately,	because	you	know	that	in	Greek,	you	match	things,	
    no?	But	you’re	doing	that	very	automatically.	So	you	don’t	match	things	by	sound	
    necessarily,	 μόνους	 τους	 [mónus	 tus],	 no?	 You	 want	 it	 to	 sound	 similar.	 Think	
    about	each	bit	separately.	First	you	put	μόνος	[mónos]	into	plural.	So	let’s	do	that.		
	
S:	 Μόνοι	[móni].		
	
T:	 Μόνοι,	for	masculine,	no?	And	then	you	say,	their.		
	
S:	 Τους	[tus].		
	
T:	 Ah!	So	they	sound	very	different.	Μόνοι	 τους	[móni	tus],	but	they	are	agreeing.	
    So,	They	can’t	cook	by	themselves?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορούν	να	μαγειρεύουν	μόνοι	τους	[dhen	borún	na	mayirévun	móni	tus].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 μπορούν/δεν	 μπορούνε	 να	 μαγειρεύουν/να	 μαγειρέψουν,	 να	
    μαγειρεύουνε/να	 μαγειρέψουνε,	 μόνοι	 τους	 [dhen	 borún/dhen	 borúne	 na	
    mayirévun/na	mayirépsun,	na	mayirévune/na	mayirépsune,	móni	tus].	And	if	we	
    are	talking	about	females,	how	do	we	say,	by	themselves?		
	
S:	 Μόνες	τους	[mónes	tus].		
	
T:	 Still	“τους”	[tus].	Because	we	use,	“to	them”,	for	possession,	and	that’s	the	same	
    for	 everybody,	 no?	 Τους.	 Good.	 Μόνες	 τους.	 In	 the	 neuter,	 μόνο	 [móno],	 in	 the	
    neuter,	can	be	used	like,	“only”,	like,	I	only	want	to	see	him.	I	just	want	to	see	him.	
    So,	 give	 that	 a	 try.	 Μόνο	 [móno]	 is	 quite	 flexible;	 let’s	 see	 where	 you	 put	 it	
    intuitively.	I	only	want	to	see	him,	I	just	want	to	see	him.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	μόνο	να	τον	δω	[thélo	móno	na	ton	dho].

T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 μόνο	 να	 τον	 δω.	 Θέλω	 να	 τον	 δω	 μόνο	 [thélo	 na	 ton	 dho	 móno].	
    Good.	 I	 mentioned	 that	 “monopoly”	 was	 like,	 “mono-selling”,	 no?	 So,	 “I	 sell”,	 is	
    πουλάω	[puláo].	Πουλάω.		
	
S:	 Πουλάω.		
	
T:	 So	you	could	say	something	like,	you	know,	I	just	sell	them.	(Like,	you	know,	What	
    do	I	know,	I	just	sell	them.)	How	would	that	be?	You	can	decide	on	the	gender	of	
    the	“them”.	I	just	sell	them?		
	
S:	 Εγώ	μόνο	τα	πουλάω	[eghó	móno	ta	puláo].		
	
T:	 Εγώ	 μόνο	 τα	 πουλάω.	 Εγώ	 τα	 πουλάω	 μόνο	 [eghó	 ta	 puláo	 móno].	 Το	 μόνο	 [to	
    móno],	το	μόνο,	“the	only”,	can	be	used	like,	“the	only	thing.”	Το	μόνο.	What	was	
    the	word	for,	where?		
	
S:	 Πού	[pu].		
	
T:	 Πού.	Που	[pu]	is	also	“that”,	in	the	sense	of	“which”.	So,	like,	The	only	thing	that	I	
    want.	The	only	thing	which	I	want.	That	“that”	or	“which”	is	also	που.	So,	The	only	
    thing	I	want.	The	only	thing	that/which	I	want?		
	
S:	 Το	μόνο	πράγμα	που	θέλω	[to	móno	prághma	pu	thélo].		
	
T:	 So	 you	 don’t	 have	 to	 say,	 “thing”,	 but	 as	 you’ve	 put	 πράγμα	 [prághma]	 up,	 and	
    we’ve	learned	this	plural	now,	how	would	you	say,	things?		
	
S:	 Πράγματα	[prághmata].		
	
T:	 Πράγματα.	Good.	But	that’s	included.	Το	μόνο	[to	móno]	is	“the	only	thing.”	We	
    don’t	need	to	say,	“thing.”		
	
S:	 Το	μόνο	που	θέλω	[to	móno	pu	thélo].		
	
T:	 Το	 μόνο	 που	 θέλω.	 No?	 The	 only	 thing	 we	 want	 is	 to	 stay	 by	 ourselves.	 So,	 The	
    only	thing	that/which	we	want?		
	
S:	 Το	μόνο	που	θέλουμε	[to	móno	pu	thélume].		
	
T:	 Is	to	stay	by	ourselves.		
	
S:	 Είναι	να	μείνουμε	μόνοι	μας	[íne	na	mínume	móni	mas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.	Το	μόνο	που	θέλουμε.	So,	το	μόνο	που	θέλουμε	(the	only	
    thing	 which/that	 we	 want),	 είναι	 να	 μείνουμε	 μόνοι	 μας	 (is	 that	 we	 stay	 by	
    ourselves,	is	to	stay	by	ourselves).	Very	well	done.

Teacher:	How	is,	I	want	it?		
	
Student:	Το	θέλω	[to	thélo].		
	
T:	 Το	 θέλω.	 But	 what	 if	 you	 mean,	 like,	 the	 movie,	 which	 is	 feminine,	 η	 ταινία	 [i	
    tenía]?		
	
S:	 Την	θέλω	[tin	thélo].	
	
T:	 Την	θέλω.	I	want	to	see	it?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	την	δω	[thélo	na	tin	dho].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	 να	 την	 δω.	 Good.	 in	 the	 same	 way,	 if	 you	 say,	 “I	 want	 to	 see	 the	 movie”,	
    when	you	say,	“the	movie”,	it’s	not,	η	ταινία	[i	tenía]	anymore	in	this	situation;	it’s	
    την	 ταινία	 [tin	 tenía].	 So,	 in	 Greek,	 we	 have	 two	 ways	 of	 saying,	 “the	 movie”,	
    depending	 on	 whether	 it’s	 behaving	 like	 “she”,	 or	 like	 “her”.	 When	 we	 say,	 The	
    movie	 is	 starting	 now,	 it’s	 behaving	 like	 “she”,	 no?	 The	 movie	 is	 starting.	 She	 is	
    starting.	 So	 here,	 we	 leave	 it	 as	 it	 is	 –	 η	 ταινία	 [i	 tenía].	 So	 let’s	 say	 that.	 What	
    was,	I	start?	Αρχή	was	“the	start”,	η	αρχή	[i	archí],	and,	I	start?		
	
S:	 Αρχίζω	[archízo].		
	
T:	 Αρχίζω.	Good.	So,	The	movie	is	starting	now?		
	
S:	 Αρχίζει	τώρα	η	ταινία	[archízi	tóra	i	tenía].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Η	 ταινία	 αρχίζει	 τώρα	 [i	 tenía	 archízi	 tóra].	 Αρχίζει	 η	 ταινία	 τώρα	
    [archízi	 i	 tenía	 tóra].	 Αρχίζει	 τώρα	 η	 ταινία.	 Good.	 So,	 η	 ταινία	 [i	 tenía],	 in	 this	
    situation,	 is	 acting	 like,	 “she”	 –	 She	 is	 starting.	 So,	 η	 ταινία.	 But	 if	 you	 say,	 “I’m	
    watching	 the	 movie”,	 here	 the	 movie	 is	 behaving	 like	 “her”.	 “I’m	 watching	 the	
    movie”,	here	the	movie	is	behaving	like	her.	“I’m	watching	the	movie”	is	like,	“I’m	
    watching	her”,	not	like,	“I’m	watching	she.”	That	doesn’t	make	any	sense.	So	here,	
    we	don’t	use,	η	ταινία	[i	tenía],	which	is	like,	“she”;	we	use,	την	ταινία	[tin	tenía],	
    which	is	like,	“her.”	So,	I’m	watching/I’m	seeing	the	movie?		
	
S:	 Βλέπω	την	ταινία	[vlépo	tin	tenía].		
	
T:	 Βλέπω	την	ταινία.	Good.	I’m	watching	it,	and	we	mean,	the	movie?		
	
S:	 Την	βλέπω	[tin	vlépo].		
	
T:	 Την	βλέπω.	So	we	see	again,	like	we	did	right	at	the	beginning	with	the	neuter,	no,	
    as	 we	 saw	 το	 [to]	 for	 “the”	 and	 also	 for	 “it”,	 how	 the	 correct	 word	 for	 “the”

	 “Friend”,	was	φίλος	[fílos].

T:	 Η	 φίλη	 μου.	 My	 friend	 wants.	 If	 we	 mean	 a	 female,	 is	 it	 like	 ”she”,	 or	 is	 it	 like

                                                                                                  220
T:	 Mε.	Mε	also	means,	“with.”	So,	if	you	say,	I	want	to	do	it	with	my	friend,	a	female	
    friend	still,	is	this	like,	I	want	to	do	it	with	she,	or,	I	want	to	do	it	with	her?		
	
S:	 With	her.		
	
T:	 With	her.	So	how	would	you	say	that,	I	want	to	do	it	with	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	το	κάνω	με	την	φίλη	μου	[thélo	na	to	káno	me	tin	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	 να	 το	κάνω	 με	την	 φίλη	 μου.	So,	 With	 my	 friend,	 is	like,	 “with	
    her”,	rather	than,	“with	she”,	so	we	use	“την	[tin]”.	Tην	φίλη	μου.	I	want	to	see	
    the	movie	with	my	friend.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	δω	[thélo	na	dho],	or,	βλέπω	[vlépo],	because	it	takes	a	long	time?		
	
T:	 So,	it’s	not	about	the	amount	of	time.	It’s	about	the	way	you	refer	to	the	time.	So,	
    it	 could	 be	 ten	 years,	 but	 if	 you	 refer	 to	 it	 as	 a	 closed	 period,	 you	 still	 use	 the	
    closed	 form	 of	 the	 verb.	 It’s	 not	 about	 how	 long	 it	 takes.	 So,	 I	 want	 to	 see	 the	
    movie,	 that’s	 like,	 you	 know,	 a	 closed	 event.	 I	 want	 to	 see	 the	 movie	 with	 my	
    friend	(a	female	friend).		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	δω	την	ταινία	με	την	φίλη	μου	[thélo	na	dho	tin	tenía	me	tin	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	 In	 both	 situations,	 “the	 movie”	 and	 “the	 friend	 my”,	 “my	 friend”,	 no,	 it’s	
    behaving	like,	“her.”	Θέλω	να	δω	την	ταινία	με	την	φίλη	μου.	Good.	So	in	Greek	
    we	 are	 changing	 the	 words	 for	 “the”	 to	 reflect	 what	 the	 noun	 is	 doing,	 how	 it’s	
    behaving.	“Far”	or	“far	away”	is,	μακριά	[makriá].	Mακριά.		
	
S:	 Mακριά.		
	
T:	 You	 know	 we	 have	 this	 in	 English,	 like,	 I	 don’t	 know,	 “macroeconomics”,	 or	
    something	like	this,	no?	Mακριά.	Far,	or	far	away.	What	was,	the	only	thing?	How	
    were	we	saying	that?	Like	in	“monopoly”.		
	
S:	 Το	μόνο	πράγμα	[to	móno	prághma].Το	μόνο	[to	móno].		
	
T:	 Το	μόνο.	Good.	The	only	thing	we	want?		
	
S:	 Το	μόνο	που	θέλουμε	[to	móno	pu	thélume].		
	
T:	 Το	μόνο	που	θέλουμε.	Good.	So	we	have	που	[pu]	for	“that”,	like,	“which”,	no?	
    The	 only	 thing	 that	 we	 want,	 which	 we	 want.	 Το	 μόνο	 που	 θέλουμε.	 Far	 away	
    from,	would	be,	“μακριά	…	“.	What	is,	from?		
	
S:	 Από	[apó].		
	




                                                                                                    221
T:	 Like	in	“apostle”,	that	we	saw	recently.	Mακριά	από	[makriá	apó].	What	was,	the	
    city,	like	in	“cosmopolitan”,	a	worldly	city?		
	
S:	 Η	πόλη	[i	póli].		
	
T:	 Η	πόλη.	So,	if	we	want	to	say,	The	only	thing	we	want	is	to	live	by	ourselves/is	to	
    stay	by	ourselves	far	away	from	they	city?	Let’s	build	this	bit	by	bit.	The	only	thing	
    that	we	want.		
	
S:	 Το	μόνο	που	θέλουμε	[to	móno	pu	thélume].		
	
T:	 Is	to	stay	by	ourselves.		
	
S:	 Είναι	να	μείνουμε	μόνοι	μας	[íne	na	mínume	móni	mas].		
	
T:	 Good.	 If	 we	 are	 males,	 no,	 μόνοι,	 μόνοι	 μας	 [móni	 mas],	 or	 μόνες	 μας	 [mónes	
    mas],	if	we’re	females.	Far	from	the	city.	Now	when	we	say,	far	from	the	city,	is	
    the	city	behaving	like	“she”,	or	like	“her”?	So	you	just	have	to	test	it	and	see	what	
    sounds	natural.	“Far	from	her”.	“Far	from	she”.	Which	sounds	natural?		
	
S:	 Mακριά	από	την	πόλη	[makriá	apó	tin	póli].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 No?	 Far	 from	 her.	 Tην	 πόλη	 [tin	 póli].	 Good.	 Το	 μόνο	 που	 θέλουμε	
    είναι	να	μείνουμε	μόνοι	μας	μακριά	από	την	πόλη	[to	mono	pu	thélume	íne	na	
    mínume	 móni	 mas	 makriá	 apó	 tin	 póli].	 And	 also,	 από	 την	 [apó	 tin],	 you	 can	
    contract	to	άπ’	την	[áp’tin]	–	μακριά	άπ’	την	πόλη	[makriá	áp’tin	póli].	Very	good.	
    So	with	feminine	and	masculine	nouns,	as	we	will	see,	you	have	to	think	about	if	
    they	are	behaving	like,	“she”	or	“her”,	like	“he”,	or	like	“him”?

T:	 Αυτό.	For	neuter,	no?	And	for	masculine?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	[aftós].		
	
T:	 And	for	feminine?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	[aftí].		
	
T:	 Αυτή.	So	this	is,	“this”	or,	“this	one”,	and	can	also	mean,	“this	guy”	or,	“this	lady”,	
    no?	Αυτός,	αυτή.	How	would	you	say,	Τhis	one	…	(you	could	choose	the	gender),	
    this	one	is	for	his	friend.	We’re	still	with	a	female	friend.	So,	let’s	begin	with,	This	
    one	is.		
	
S:	 Αυτό	είναι	[aftó	íne].		
	
T:	 Αυτό	είναι,	for	his	friend	(female	friend).		
	
S:	 Για	την	φίλη	του	[ya	tin	fíli	tu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Για	 την	 φίλη	 του.	 Για	 την	 φίλη	 του,	 because,	 “for	 his	 friend”,	 is	 like,	
    “for	her,”	no,	rather	than,	“for	she”.	So	we	say,	την	φίλη	[tin	fíli].	Για	την	φίλη	του.	
    And,	for	his	friends	(plural	feminine)?		
	
S:	 Για	τις	φίλες	του	[ya	tis	fíles	tu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Για	τις	φίλες	του.	Very	good.	And	we	said	that,	για	[ya],	“for”,	with	να	
    [na],	για	να	[ya	na],	gives	us,	“so”	or,	“so	that.”	Για	να.	What	was,	I	cook?		
	
S:	 Μαγειρεύω	[mayirévo].		
	
T:	 Μαγειρεύω.	 So	 if	 you	 were	 to	 say,	 for	 example,	 “So	 that	 my	 friends	 cook”.	 “So	
    that	my	friends	cook”,	still	female	friends.	Is	this	“So	that	they	cook”	or,	“So	that	
    them	cook”?		
	
S:	 So	that	they	cook.		
	
T:	 Very	good.	So	that	my	friends	cook.		


                                                                                                224
	
S:	 Για	να	μαγειρέψουν	οι	φίλες	μου	[ya	na	mayirépsun	i	fíles	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Για	 να	 μαγειρέψουν	 οι	 φίλες	 μου.	 Or,	 Για	 να	 μαγειρεύουν	 [ya	 na	
    mayirévun],	 depending	 on	 the	 context.	 Very	 good.	 “I	 like”,	 or	 “I	 like	 it”	 is,	 μου	
    αρέσει	[mu	arési].	Mου	αρέσει.		
	
S:	 Mου	αρέσει.		
	
T:	 And	this	is	more	like,	“It	is	pleasing	to	me”,	literally.	We	have	μου	[mu],	which	is,	
    “to	me”,	and	αρέσει	[arési],	which	is	in	the	he/she/it	form.	So	it’s	not	like	English,	
    where	you	say,	“I	like”,	no?	You	are	saying,	“It	is	pleasing	to	me”.	Mου	αρέσει.		
	
S:	 Mου	αρέσει.		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 αρέσει	 [arési]	 is	 in	 the	 he/she/it	 form,	 and	 we	 don’t	 want	 to	 say,	 μου	
    αρέσω	[mu	aréso],	because	what	would	that	mean?		
	
S:	 I	like	myself.		
	
T:	 I	like	myself,	no?	So,	if	you	make	a	direct	transfer	from	how	you	do	it	English,	you	
    will	say	something	quite	funny	there,	no?	Mου	αρέσει.	It	is	pleasing	to	me.	How	
    would	you	say,	I	like	this?		
	
S:	 Αυτό	μου	αρέσει	[aftó	mu	arési].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτό	μου	αρέσει.	Μου	αρέσει	αυτό	[mu	arési	aftó],	if	we’re	talking	about	a	
    neuter	thing,	no?	The	word	for,	“a	lot”,	or	“very”,	was?		
	
S:	 Πολύ	[polí].		
	
T:	 Πολύ.	Good.	I	like	it	a	lot?		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	πολύ	[mu	arési	polí].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μου	αρέσει	πολύ.	You	will	also	hear,	μ’	αρέσει	[m’arési].	M’	αρέσει.		
	
S:	 M’	αρέσει.		
	
T:	 And	 that’s	 the	 contraction,	 that’s	 the	 contraction	 of,	 “μου”	 to	 “M	 apostrophe”,	
    and	then	the	verb,	no?	M’	αρέσει.		
	
S:	 M’	αρέσει.		
	
T:	 M’	αρέσει.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	We	like	it	a	lot?	So,	we’re	going	to	say,	It	is	
    very	pleasing	to	us.		
	


                                                                                               225
S:	 Μας	αρέσει	πολύ	[mas	arési	polí].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μας	αρέσει	πολύ.	We	like	them?		
	
S:	 Αυτούς	μας	αρέσουν	[aftús	mas	arésun].		
	
T:	 Αυτούς	[aftús]?		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	[aftí].	Αυτοί	μας	αρέσουν	[aftí	mas	arésun].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Αυτοί	 μας	 αρέσουν.	 And	 we	 don’t	 really	 need	 “αυτοί”;	 we	 can	 just	 say,	
    They	 please	 us,	 no?	 That	 information	 is	 included	 there	 in	 the	 verb,	 “αρέσουν”	
    [arésun].	Mας	αρέσουν	[mas	arésun].	So,	They	like	us?	So,	the	first	thing	we	want	
    to	 do	 is	 think	 how	 it	 would	 be	 in	 English,	 no?	 They	 like	 us.	 So,	 okay,	 We	 are	
    pleasing	to	them.		
	
S:	 Τους	αρέσουμε	[tus	arésume].		
	
T:	 Τους	αρέσουμε.	Very	good.	He	likes	us?		
	
S:	 Mας	[mas]?	Um	…	Tον	αρέσουμε	[ton	arésume].		
	
T:	 Good,	but	it	would	be	“to	him”.	We	are	pleasing	to	him.		
	
S:	 Tου	αρέσουμε	[tu	arésume].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Tου	αρέσουμε.	He	likes	us;	We	are	pleasing	to	him.	Tου	αρέσουμε.	She	
    likes	us.		
	
S:	 Της	αρέσουμε	[Tis	arésume].		
	
T:	 Της	αρέσουμε.	So	we	really	need	to	think	about	it	here	no,	because	we’re	doing	
    something	completely	different	in	Greek	to	what	we	do	in	English.	“She	likes	us”:	
    there	 it’s	 “she”	 in	 charge	 of	 the	 verb,	 no?	 She	 likes.	 But	 in	 Greek,	 no:	 We	 are	
    pleasing	to	her.	Της	αρέσουμε.	She	likes	our	friend	(a	female	friend)?	So,	is	“our	
    friend”	here	like	“she”,	or	like	“her”?	She	likes	our	friend.		
	
S:	 Like	“she”.		
	
T:	 Good.	Why?		
	
S:	 Because	the	friend	is	pleasing	to	her.		
	
T:	 Good.	No?	She	likes	our	friend.	Our	friend	pleases	her.	So,	“Our	friend	pleases”,	is	
    like,	 “she	 pleases”.	 But	 if	 we	 were	 to	 think	 about	 it	 from	 English,	 no?	 “She	 likes	
    our	friend”:	we	would	think	it’s	like,	“her”;	“she	likes	her,”	no?	So	we	must	think	




                                                                                                226
   about	how	we	say	it	in	Greek.	She	likes	our	friend;	Our	friend	is	pleasing	to	her.	So,	
   let’s	do	that,	Our	(female)	friend	is	pleasing	to	her.		
	
S:	 Η	φίλη	μας	της	αρέσει	[i	fíli	mas	tis	arési].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Η	φίλη	μας	της	αρέσει.	Της	αρέσει	η	φίλη	μας	[tis	arési	i	fíli	mas].	If	
    you	 go	 to	 Cyprus,	 you	 might	 hear,	 “αρέσκει	 μου"	 [aréski	 mu]	 or,	 “αρέσκει	 σου”	
    [aréski	su],	for	“I	like	it”	or,	“You	like	it.”	This	is	because	in	the	Cypriot	dialect,	the	
    verb	is	slightly	different.	We	have,	αρέσκω	[arésko],	and	we	often	have	words	like,	
    με	 [me],	 μου	 [mu],	 etc.,	 after	 the	 verbs.	 So,	 Aρέσκει	 μου,	 αρέσκει	 μου.	 So	 I	
    mention	 odd	 things	 about	 dialects	 in	 Greek,	 but	 the	 Cypriot	 dialect	 is	 especially	
    different.	 And	 there	 is	 also	 a	 possiblity	 of	 a	 conversion	 course	 for	 the	 Cypriot	
    dialect,	which	is	currently	third	in	the	voting	campaign.	So	if	you’re	learning	Greek	
    for	Cyprus,	check	out	the	voting	campaign	on	the	website;	maybe	you	can	vote	for	
    the	Cypriot	Greek	conversion,	or	maybe	it’s	out	by	the	time	you	hear	this.	What	
    was,	very	or,	a	lot?		
	
S:	 Πόλυ	[póli].		
	
T:	 Πολύ	[polí].	And,	the	city?		
	
S:	 Η	πόλη	[i	póli].		
	
T:	 Η	πόλη.	Good,	no?	So	we	have,	πολύ	[polí],	“very”,	or	“a	lot”,	and	then,	η	πόλη	[i	
    póli],	“the	city”,	like	in	cosmopolitan,	no,	we	said	was	a	worldly	city.	So	how	would	
    you	say,	She	likes	the	city	a	lot?		
	
S:	 Η	πόλη	της	αρέσει	πολύ	[i	póli	tis	arési	polí].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Η	πόλη	της	αρέσει	πολύ.	Της	αρέσει	πολύ	η	πόλη	[tis	arési	polí	i	póli].	
    You	could	also	say,	πάρα	πολύ	[pára	polí],	for	“very	much”.		
	
S:	 Πάρα	πολύ.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	They	like	the	city	very	much?	They	like	the	city	very	much.		
	
S:	 Η	πόλη	τους	αρέσει	πάρα	πολύ	[i	póli	tus	arési	pára	polí].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Η	πόλη	τους	αρέσει	πάρα	πολύ.	Τους	αρέσει	η	πόλη	πάρα	πολύ	[tus	
    arési	 i	 póli	 pára	 polí].	 So	 this	 could	 be	 a	 male	 or	 female	 group,	 with	 τους	 [tus].	
    Τους	αρέσει.	So	in,	Τους	αρέσει	η	πόλη	[tus	arési	i	póli],	no,	we	have,	“η	πόλη"	
    acting	like,	“she”,	no?	She	is	pleasing	to	them.	But	if	we	say	something	like,	I	don’t	
    understand	the	city,	then	it’s	behaving	like	“her”,	no?	What	was,	I	understand?		
	
S:	 Καταλαβαίνω	[katalavéno].		
	




                                                                                                 227
T:	 Καταλαβαίνω.	Good.	We	have,	κατα	[kata],	like	“down”	or	“under”,	no?	Just	like	
    understand.	So,	I	don’t	understand	the	city.		
	
S:	 Δεν	καταλαβαίνω	την	πόλη	[dhen	katalavéno	tin	póli].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 καταλαβαίνω	 την	 πόλη,	 no?	 It’s	 like,	 “I	 don’t	 understand	 her”,	
    rather	 than	 “she.”	 So,	 when	 we	 are	 deciding	 to	 use,	 “η”	 or,	 “την”,	 for	 example,	
    with	our	feminine	nouns,	it’s	not	about	the	position	where	you	find	it,	no,	αfter	or	
    before	 the	 verb.	 And	 we	 don’t	 want	 to	 oversimplify	 it	 in	 that	 way.	 It’s	 about	
    function;	it’s	about	what	it’s	doing.	It’s	about	whether	the	noun	is	behaving	like,	
    “she”	or	“her.”	What	was	the	word	for,	in,	in	Greek?	Just,	in,	by	itself?		
	
S:	 Σε	[se].		
	
T:	 Σε,	no,	σε.	And	when	this	combines	with	the	word	for,	“the”,	it	contracts,	so,	In	
    the	house,	was?		
	
S:	 Στο	σπίτι	[sto	spíti].		
	
T:	 Στο	σπίτι.	Good.	What	would,	In	the	city,	be?		
	
S:	 Στην	πόλη	[stin	póli].		
	
T:	 Στην	πόλη.	Very	good,	no?	Because	it’s,	“in	her”,	rather	than,	“in	she.”	How	would	
    you	say,	I	like	to	stay	in	the	city?		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	να	μείνω	στην	πόλη	[mu	arési	na	míno	stin	póli].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	But,	να	μείνω	[na	míno],	I	think,	was	a	bit	automatic.	I	don’t	think	you	
    thought	about	it.		
	
S:	 Oh,	you	said,	“staying	in	the	city”.	So	…		
	
T:	 Well	think	about	the	meaning	rather	than,	you	know,	the	direct,	if	it’s	“staying”,	
    or	 not,	 no?	 So	 if	 you	 say,	 “I	 like	 to	 stay	 in	 the	 city”,	 that	 sentence	 necessarily	
    refers	to	a	specific	period	of	time,	or	talks	generally?		
	
S:	 That’s	more	generally.		
	
T:	 Yes,	totally	general,	no?	So	give	me	that	again.		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	να	μείνω	...	να	μένω	...	Μου	αρέσει	να	μένω	στην	πόλη	[mu	arési	na	
    méno	stin	póli].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μου	 αρέσει	 να	 μένω	 στην	 πόλη.	 Very	 good.	 I	 like	 to	 stay	 in	 the	 city	
    with	my	friend.	So	again,	you	know	we	are	referring	to	a	general	thing,	something	
    we	like	to	do,	no?	I	like	to	stay	in	the	city	with	my	friend	–	and	still	a	female	friend.

    mu	arési].	“New”,	new,	and	also	“young”	in	Greek	is,	νέος	[néos].	Nέος.		
	
S:	 Nέος.		
	
T:	 This	is	an	adjective,	a	describing	word,	no?	What	form	of	it	did	I	give	you?	Nέος.		
	
S:	 The	masculine.		
	
T:	 The	masculine.	So	the	neuter	would	be?		
	
S:	 Nέο	[néo].		
	
T:	 Nέο.	And	the	feminine	is,	νέα	[néa].	Nέα.		
	
S:	 Nέα.		
	
T:	 So,	 we’ve	 seen	 before	 with	 nouns,	 that	 we	 can	 have	 [a]	 or	 [i]	 for	 a	 feminine	
    ending.	For	example,	μέρα	[méra],	“day”,	or	φίλη	[fíli],	“female	friend”,	no,	ending	
    A	(α)	and	ending	I	(ι).	And	some	adjectives	might	also	end	A	(α)	for	the	feminine	as	
    well,	like	νέα.	Of	course	we	have	νέος	all	over	English,	no?	Like	whenever	we	say,	
    “neo-something”,	 like,	 I	 don’t	 know,	 “neocolonialism”	 or	 “neoliberalism”,	 this	 is	
    just	the	Greek	word	for	“new.”	And	like	I	mentioned,	also	used	like	“young”.	What	
    was	the	word	for,	I	am,	do	you	remember?	It	sounds	quite	a	bit	like,	“I’m”.

    φίλη	[fíli]?		
	
S:	 Νέα	φίλη	[néa	fíli].		
	
T:	 Νέα	 φίλη.	 Very	 good.	 Νέα	 φίλη.	 Good.	 So	 in	 Greek,	 just	 like	 in	 English,	 the	
    adjective	 comes	 before	 the	 noun.	 The	 describing	 word	 comes	 before	 what	 it	
    describes.	New	friend,	or,	young	friend	–	νέα	φίλη.	If	you	say,	“My	new	friend”,	in

S:	 Η	νέα	μου	φίλη.		
	
T:	 So	you	get,	“the	new	my	friend”.	So	if	you	have	an	adjective	with	a	noun	in	this	
    way,	 the	 word	 for	 “my”	 is	 most	 commonly	 going	 to	 come	 after	 the	 adjective	 in	
    Greek.	Kind	of	getting	it	out	of	the	way	the	first	place	we	can.	Η	νέα	μου	φίλη.	Η	
    νέα	μου	φίλη.		
	
S:	 Η	νέα	μου	φίλη.

T:	 Περιμένω.	Good.	I’m	waiting	for	my	friend.	And,	you	know,	I	said,	wait,	or	await,	
    because	 we	 don’t	 use	 “for”,	 no?	 It’s	 more	 like,	 I’m	 awaiting	 my	 friend.	 Again	 a	
    female	friend.		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	την	φίλη	μου	[periméno	tin	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Περιμένω	την	φίλη	μου.	I’m	waiting	for	her.	I’m	awaiting	her.		
	
S:	 Την	περιμένω	[tin	periméno].		
	
T:	 Την	περιμένω.	I’m	waiting	for	them.	Feminine,	feminine	“them”.		
	
S:	 Τις	περιμένω	[tis	periméno].		
	
T:	 Τις	περιμένω.	I’m	waiting	for	my	friends,	feminine	friends.		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	τις	φίλες	μου	[periméno	tis	fíles	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Περιμένω	τις	φίλες	μου.	My	friends	are	waiting	for	me.	Still	female.		
	
S:	 Με	περιμένουν	οι	φίλες	μου	[me	periménun	i	fíles	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Με	περιμένουν	οι	φίλες	μου.	Οι	φίλες	μου	με	περιμένουν	[i	fíles	mu	
    me	periménun].	No?	We	have	that	flexibility.		
	
	 Έξω	[ékso],	έξω,	means	“outside”.	Έξω,	“outside”.		
	
S:	 Έξω.		
	
T:	 Like	 “Exodus”,	 no?	 Same	 root	 as	 “exit”.	 Έξω.	 My	 friends	 are	 waiting	 for	 me	
    outside.	 And	 let’s	 talk	 about	 masculine	 or	 mixed	 friends.	 My	 friends	 are	 waiting	
    for	me	outside.		
	
S:	 Με	περιμένουν	οι	φίλοι	μου	έξω	[me	periménun	i	fíli	mu	ékso].		
	
T:	 Good.	Με	περιμένουν	οι	φίλοι	μου	έξω.	Οι	φίλοι	μου	με	περιμένουν	έξω	[i	fíli	mu	
    me	periménun	ékso].	I	will	wait	for	them	outside,	and	still	we	mean	masculine	or	
    mixed.	I	will	wait	for	them	outside.		
	


                                                                                             232
S:	 Θα	τους	περιμένω	έξω	[tha	tus	periméno	ékso].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θα	 τους	 περιμένω	 έξω.	 I	 will	 wait	 for	 them	 outside.	 And	 this	 is	 a	
    masculine	or	mixed	“them”,	no?	Τους	[tus].	If	we	say,	I’m	waiting	for	my	friends,	
    is,	“my	friends”,	behaving	like,	“they”	or,	“them”?		
	
S:	 Them.		
	
T:	 Yeah,	 I’m	 waiting	 for	 them,	 no?	 So	 if	 we’re	 talking	 about	 masculine	 friends,	
    masculine	 or	 mixed	 friends,	 we’re	 going	 to	 say,	 Περιμένω	 τους	 φίλους	 μου	
    [periméno	tus	fílus	mu]	...	τους	φίλους	μου.	So	when	OS	(-ος)	nouns,	those	nouns	
    ending	OS	(-ος),	behave	like	“them”,	rather	than	“they”,	then	their	final	[os]	also	
    changes	to	[us]	(-ους),	like	τους	[tus].	So	we	get,	τους	φίλους	[tus	fílus].		
	
S:	 Tους	φίλους.		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	I’m	waiting	for	my	friends?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	τους	φίλος	μου	...	τους	φίλους	μου	[periméno	tus	fílos	mu	…	tus	fílus	
    mu].		
	
T:	 Περιμένω	τους	φίλους	μου	[periméno	tus	fílus	mu].	Very	good.	So	we	have,	τους,	
    no,	 like	 “them,”	 but	 also	 the	 noun	 there	 ending	 [os],	 which	 is	 a	 huge	 group	 of	
    nouns	in	Greek,	we’ll	also	change	to	[us]	(-ους).	Tους	φίλους.	How	would	you	say,	
    I	haven’t	seen	my	friends	for	years?	I	have	years,	να	[na],	I	see	my	friends.		
	
S:	 Έχω	χρόνια	να	δω	τους	φίλους	μου	[ékho	khrónia	na	dho	tus	fílus	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	χρόνια	να	δω	τους	φίλους	μου.	Very	good.	How	would	you	say,	I	
    haven’t	seen	their	friends	for	years?		
	
S:	 Έχω	χρόνια	να	δω	τους	φίλους	τους	[ékho	khrónia	na	dho	tus	fílus	tus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	χρόνια	να	δω	τους	φίλους	τους.	No?	So	the	first	“τους”	[tus]	there	
    is	 just	 “them”,	 no?	 Tους	 φίλους,	 the	 τους	 of,	 “them”.	 And	 the	 second,	 “τους”,	
    τους	φίλους	τους,	is	the	τους	of,	“to	them”,	which	we	also	use	for	possession.	So	
    “their”,	like,	their	friends.	Έχω	χρόνια	να	δω	τους	φίλους	τους.	What	was,	I	know?		
	
S:	 Ξέρω	[kséro].		
	
T:	 Ξέρω.	 Do	 you	 know	 his	 new	 friends?	 So,	 we	 will	 say,	 Do	 you	 know	 the	 new	 his	
    friends?	 No?	 When	 we	 have	 an	 adjective	 before	 the	 noun,	 we	 will	 get	 that	
    possession	out	the	way	where	we	can.	So,	Do	you	know?	is	the	first	bit.		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις;	[kséris?].		
	
T:	 Ξέρεις;	His	new	friends.		


                                                                                             233
	
S:	 Τους	νέος	του	φίλους	[tus	néos	tu	fílus].		
	
T:	 Almost.	The	adjective	ending	in	[os]	(-ος),	no,	will	also	change	to	match	“τους”.		
	
S:	 Τους	νέους	του	φίλους	[tus	néus	tu	fílus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.	So	this	is	extremely	complicated,	until	you	think	about	one	
    bit	at	a	time,	and	then	it	becomes	very	simple,	no?	Ξέρεις	[kséris],	“do	you	know”,	
    τους	νέους	του	[tus	néus	tu]	(because	this	is	“his”,	no?),	his	new	friends,	which	we	
    prefer	 mostly	 to	 put	 after	 the	 adjective,	 φίλους	 [fílus].	 Ξέρεις	 τους	 νέους	 του	
    φίλους	 [kséris	 tus	 néus	 tu	 fílus].	 The	 word	 for	 “road”	 was,	 δρόμος	 [dhrómos].	
    Δρόμος.		
	
S:	 Δρόμος.		
	
T:	 This	is	δέλτα	[dhélta]	(Δ/δ),	R	(Ρ/ρ),	(which	the	R	in	Greek	looks	like	a	P),	O-M-O-S.	
    Δρόμος.	 This	 is	 another	 [os]	 noun,	 no,	 ending	 O-S	 (-ος).	 We	 mentioned	
    “hippodrome”	in	English,	which	means	something	like,	“horse	road”,	no?	We	have	
    μονόδρομος	[monódhromos],	I	mentioned	as	well,	“one-way	street”.	How	would	
    the	plural	of	“δρόμος”	be?		
	
S:	 Δρόμοι	[dhrómi].		
	
T:	 Δρόμοι.	And	how	is	that	[i]	sound	on	the	end	spelt?		
	
S:	 That’s	O-I	(-οι).		
	
T:	 O-I.	Good.	Our	plural	[i]	sound	is	spelt	O-I.	And	how	would	“οι	δρόμοι”	[i	dhrómi]	
    be	when	it’s	behaving	like	“them”?	So	there,	in	its	standard	form,	“οι	δρόμοι”	is	
    for	when	it	is	behaving	like	“they”,	no?	What	if	it’s	behaving	like	“them”?		
	
S:	 Τους	δρόμους	[tus	dhrómus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τους	δρόμους.	And,	The	new	roads,	behaving	like	“them”?		
	
S:	 Τους	νέους	δρόμους	[tus	néus	dhrómus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τους	νέους	δρόμους.	But	what	if	you	were	just	saying,	The	new	roads,	
    and	they	were	behaving	like	“they”,	in	their	standard	form?		
	
S:	 Οι	νέοι	δρόμοι	[i	néi	dhrómi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Οι	νέοι	δρόμοι.	So	if	we	say,	I	don’t	understand	the	roads?		
	
S:	 Δεν	καταλαβαίνω	τους	δρόμους	[dhen	katalavéno	tus	dhrómus].		
	


                                                                                           234
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 καταλαβαίνω	 τους	 δρόμους.	 “Greece”	 in	 Greek	 is,	 Ελλάδα	
    [eládha].		
	
S:	 Ελλάδα.		
	
T:	 Or	mostly,	“the	Greece”,	η	Ελλάδα	[i	eládha].	And	that	doesn’t	sound	much	like	
    the	word	“Greece”	in	English,	but	it	does	sound	like	“Hellenic”,	which	of	course,	
    “Ελλάδα”	is	related	to.	I	don’t	understand	the	roads	in	Greece?	So	the	first	bit	is,	I	
    don’t	understand	the	roads.		
	
S:	 Δεν	καταλαβαίνω	τους	δρόμους	[dhen	katalavéno	tus	dhrómus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	καταλαβαίνω	τους	δρόμους.	“In	Greece”	is,	In	the	Greece.		
	
S:	 Στην	Ελλάδα	[stin	eládha].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Στην	 Ελλάδα,	 no?	 We	 have	 a	 noun	 here,	 “the	 Greece”,	 no,	 which	
    means	we	now	have	to	think	about	whether	it’s	acting	like	“she”,	or	like	“her”.	So,	
    In	the	Greece,	is	like,	“in	her”,	no?	Στην	Ελλάδα.	Δεν	καταλαβαίνω	τους	δρόμους	
    στην	Ελλάδα	[dhen	katalavéno	tus	dhrómus	stin	eládha].		
	
    	                               	




                                                                                      235
Complete	Greek,	Track	53	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	What	was,	friend,	or,	the	friend,	for	a	masculine	friend?		
	
Student:	Ο	φίλος	[o	fílos].		
	
T:	 Ο	φίλος.	And,	the	road?		
	
S:	 O	δρόμος	[o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 O	δρόμος.	And,	my	friend	(masculine)?		
	
S:	 Ο	φίλος	μου	[o	fílos	mu].		
	
T:	 Ο	φίλος	μου.	And,	my	new	friend?		
	
S:	 Ο	νέος	μου	φίλος	[o	néos	mu	fílos].		
	
T:	 Ο	νέος	μου	φίλος.	And	like	I	mentioned,	this	 could	also	 mean,	my	young	friend,	
    but	mostly	in	the	context	it	will	be	understood	what	you	mean.	So	all	of	this	–	ο	
    φίλος,	ο	φίλος	μου,	ο	νέος	μου	φίλος	–	is	in	the	“he”	form,	no,	when	the	noun	is	
    acting	 like	 “he”,	 rather	 than	 “him.”	 When,	 ο	 φίλος,	 behaves	 like	 “him”,	 the	 “o”	
    will	of	course	becomes	the	word	for	“him”,	no?	Which	is?		
	
S:	 Τον	[ton].		
	
T:	 Τον.	But	this	isn’t	the	only	change.	We	also	lose	the	S	(-ς)	of	the	masculine	nouns	
    too.	 So	 we	 get,	 τον	 δρόμο	 [ton	 dhrómo],	 τον	 φίλο	 [ton	 fílo],	 when	 it’s	 behaving	
    like	“him.”	He	is	waiting	for	my	friend.		
	
S:	 Περιμένει	για	τον	φίλο	μου	[periméni	ya	ton	fílo	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	we	don’t	include,	“for,”	no?	This	verb	is	like,	“to	wait”,	or	“to	wait	for”,	
    or	“to	await”	–	all	included	there	already	in	the	verb.		
	
S:	 Περιμένει	τον	φίλο	μου	[periméni	ton	fílo	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Περιμένει	 τον	 φίλο	 μου.	 So	 these	 changes	 in	 nouns,	 that	 we	 witness	 in	
    Greek,	 allows	 us	 much	 more	 flexibility,	 no?	 Everything	 can	 pretty	 much	 go	
    everywhere,	because	we	know	what’s	going	on;	we	know	what’s	doing	what.	He’s	
    waiting	 for	 my	 friend.	 Περιμένει	 τον	 φίλο	 μου,	 or,	 Τον	 φίλο	 μου	 περιμένει	 [ton	
    fílo	mu	periméni].	My	friend	is	waiting	for	him.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Του	περιμένει	ο	φίλο	μου	[tu	periméni	o	fílo	mu].		
	
T:	 Why,	“του"	[tu]?		
	


                                                                                             236
S:	 Because	it’s	...	Oh	no,	he’s	awaiting	him,	so	it’s:	Τον	περιμένει	ο	φίλος	μου	[ton	
    periméni	o	fílos	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τον	περιμένει	ο	φίλος	μου,	or,	Ο	φίλος	μου	τον	περιμένει	[o	fílos	mu	
    ton	periméni].	No?	So	we	don’t	rely	on	word	order	for	grammar	as	heavily	as	we	
    do	in	English,	and	we	can	play	around	much	more	for	emphasis	in	Greek.	And	this	
    in	 part	 is	 facilitated	 by	 the	 way	 nouns	 change,	 depending	 on	 how	 they	 are	
    behaving	in	Greek.	Do	you	know	my	friend	(male	friend)?	Do	you	know	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	τον	φίλο	μου;	[kséris	ton	fílo	mu?].		
	
T:	 Ξέρεις	τον	φίλο	μου;	Do	you	know	my	new	friend?		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	τον	νέο	μου	φίλο;	[kséris	ton	néo	mu	fílo?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	You	took	the	S	(-ς)	also	from	the	adjective,	no?	They	are	behaving	in	
    the	 same	 way.	 Ξέρεις	 τον	 νέο	 μου	 φίλο;	 No?	 So,	 we	 lost	 the	 S	 (-ς)	 from	 “νέος”	
    [néos]	 and	 from	 “φίλος”	 [fílos],	 because	 that	 whole	 block	 of	 the	 sentence,	 that	
    say,	is	behaving	like	“him”.	Ξέρεις	τον	νέο	μου	φίλο;	Do	you	know	my	new	friend?	
    What	was,	road?		
	
S:	 Ο	δρόμος	[o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Or,	the	road,	ο	δρόμος	[o	dhrómos].	“I	find”,	I	find,	in	Greek	is,	βρίσκω	[vrísko].	
    Βρίσκω.		
	
S:	 Βρίσκω.		
	
T:	 So	this	[v]	sound	is	the	letter	that	looks	like	a	B	(Β/β)	with	a	longer	tail,	no?	But	it	
    gives	us	[v],	βρίσκω.	I	don’t	find	the	road?		
	
S:	 Δεν	βρίσκω	τον	δρόμο	[dhen	vrísko	ton	dhrómo].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 βρίσκω	 τον	 δρόμο.	 So	 maybe	 here	 in	 English	 it	 would	 be	 more	
    common	 to	 say,	 I	 can’t	 find	 the	 road,	 no?	 But	 we	 overuse	 “can’t”	 quite	 a	 lot	 in	
    English.	In	Greek,	δεν	βρίσκω	τον	δρόμο.	But	you	could	also	say,	Ι	can’t	find	the	
    road,	 but	 you	 would	 need	 the	 closed	 version	 of,	 βρίσκω	 [vrísko],	 which	 is,	 βρω	
    [vro].	Another	strange	one,	βρω.		
	
S:	 Βρω.		
	
T:	 So,	I	can’t	find	the	road?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	βρω	τον	δρόμο	[dhen	boró	na	vro	ton	dhrómo].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορώ	να	βρω	τον	δρόμο.	What	is,	I	find,	again?		
	


                                                                                               237
S:	 Βρίσκω	[vrísko].		
	
T:	 And,	You	find?		
	
S:	 Βρίσκεις	[vrískis].		
	
T:	 Βρίσκεις.	Don’t	you	find	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	βρίσκεις;	[dhen	to	vrískis?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	βρίσκεις;	Don’t	you	find	it?	And	we	mean,	the	road.		
	
S:	 Δεν	τον	βρίσκεις;	[dhen	ton	vrískis?].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Δεν	 τον	 βρίσκεις;	 “The	 bill”,	 in	 Greek,	 the	 bill,	 is,	 ο	 λογαριασμός	 [o	
    loghariazmós].	Ο	λογαριασμός.		
	
S:	 O	λογαριασμός.		
	
T:	 Good.	O	λογαριασμός.	And	this	is	like,	“log”	in,	“catalogue”,	no,	which	the	down	
    log	 –	 catalogue	 in	 Greek	 is,	 κατάλογος	 [katáloghos].	 No?	 This	 is	 just,	 the	 log.	 Ο	
    λογαριασμός.	So,	how	would	you	say,	I	want	the	bill?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	τον	λογαριασμό	[thélo	ton	loghariazmó].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	 τον	 λογαριασμό.	 Good.	 So	 the	 way	 we	 change	 nouns,	 depending	 on	 how	
    they	 are	 behaving,	 no,	 is	 not	 just	 depending	 on	 the	 linguistic	 context;	 it	 doesn’t	
    just	depend	on	what	it’s	doing	in	a	sentence,	but	also	in	life.	So,	if	you	were	in	a	
    restaurant	and	you	said,	“The	bill	please”,	you	wouldn’t	use	the	“he”	form	of	it,	
    because	what	you	mean	is,	“I	want	the	bill”	–	“I	want	him”.	“Can	you	bring	me	the	
    bill?”	“Can	you	bring	me	him?”	No?	So	even	if	you	just	say,	“the	bill”,	you	will	put	
    it	in	the	“him”	form.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Tον	λογαριασμό	[ton	loghariazmó].		
	
T:	 Good.	And	“please”	was,	παρακαλώ	[parakaló].		
	
S:	 Παρακαλώ.		
	
T:	 So,	The	bill	please.		
	
S:	 Tον	λογαριασμό	παρακαλώ	[ton	loghariazmó	parakaló].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Tον	 λογαριασμό	 παρακαλώ.	 Or	 we	 could	 also	 have,	 σε	 παρακαλώ	 [se	
    parakaló],	 “I	 beg	 you”.	 But	 imagine	 you’d	 already	 asked	 for	 the	 bill.	 Imagine	
    you’ve	already	asked	for	the	bill,	and	then	you	see	the	waiter,	and	then	you	see	




                                                                                               238
   him	again,	and	then	you	see	him	again,	and	then	you	get	his	eye,	and	you’re	like,	
   “The	bill?”	What	do	you	mean	there	when	you	say	that?		
	
S:	 What	do	I	mean?		
	
T:	 Yeah.	Imagine	you	already	asked	him	for	it.	You’ve	been	waiting.		
	
S:	 Did	you	forget	about	it,	the	bill?		
	
T:	 Okay,	 if	that’s	what	you	 meant,	then	 again	you	 would	 say,	τον	λογαριασμό	[ton	
    loghariazmó].	 But,	 maybe	 when	 you	 say,	 “The	 bill?”,	 you	 mean,	 “Where	 is	 it?”	
    “Where	 is	 the	 bill?”	 No?	 So	 maybe	 in	 that	 circumstance,	 you	 would	 say,	 O	
    λογαριασμός;	 [o	 loghariazmós?].	 “Where	 is	 it?”,	 you	 know.	 Thus,	 there	 it’s	
    behaving	like	“he”,	but	it	would	depend	on	what’s	going	on	in	your	mind,	as	well,	
    no,	 so	 that	 there	 isn’t	 necessarily	 a	 correct	 and	 an	 incorrect	 way,	 you	 know.	 So	
    we’re	not	just	looking	at	the	sentence	for	context	on	how	to	treat	nouns	in	Greek,	
    but	life	and	the	situation	about	what’s	going	on.	How	would	you	say,	I	don’t	find	
    the	bill?	I	can’t	find	the	bill.		
	
S:	 Δεν	βρίσκω	τον	λογαριασμό	[dhen	vrísko	ton	loghariazmó].

S:	 Δεν	βρίσκω	τους	λογαριασμόυς	[dhen	vrísko	tus	loghariazmús].

    of	βρίσκω	was,	βρω	[vro].	Βρω.	How	would	you	say,	I	can’t	find	it	by	myself?	You	
    can	choose	the	gender	of	the	“it”.	I	can’t	find	it	by	myself.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	το	βρω	μόνος	μου	[dhen	boró	na	to	vro	mónos	mu].

Teacher:	 We	 can	 recap	 all	 of	 what	 we’ve	 seen	 about	 nouns	 changing	 in	 different	
    ways,	depending	on	how	they’re	behaving,	with	a	very	useful	word.	This	word	is,	
    δικός	[dhikós].	Δικός.		
	
Student:	Δικός.		
	
T:	 This	means	“own”,	as	in	“my	own”,	ο	δικός	μου,	η	δική	μου,	το	δικό	μου	[o	dhikóz	
    mu,	i	dhikí	mu,	to	dhikó	mu],	depending	on	what	gender	noun	we’re	referring	to.	
    And	it	can	be	used	just	like,	“my	one”,	no?	Tο	δικό	μου,	“my	one”,	or	“my	own	
    one”,	 depending	 on	 the	 context.	 So,	 μόνος	 μου	 [mónos	 mu],	 we’ve	 seen,	 which	
    meant	“alone”,	no,	used	like,	“by	myself”	(alone	my),	μόνος	μου.	But	“my	own”,	
    as	in	possession,	not	“on	my	own”	–	“my	own”,	for	this	we	have,	δικός	[dhikós].	
    Δικός.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 Do	 you	 have	 my	 one?	 And	 we	 mean	 a	 masculine	
    object.		
	
S:	 Έχεις	τον	δικό	μου;	[échis	ton	dhikó	mu?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχεις	τον	δικό	μου;	Do	you	have	my	one?	And	we	mean	a	female	noun.		
	
S:	 Έχεις	την	δική	μου;	[échis	tin	dhikí	mu?].		
	
T:	 Έχεις	 την	 δική	 μου;	 Very	 good.	 Do	 you	 have	 my	 one?	 Έχεις	 την	 δική	 μου;	 Good.	
    You	like	my	one?	You	like	my	one.	My	one	pleases	you.	And	still	feminine,	my	one.		
	
S:	 Σου	αρέσει	η	δική	μου;	[su	arési	i	dhikí	mu?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Σου	αρέσει	η	δική	μου;	No?	Because	it’s,	My	one	pleases	you?	Η	δική	
    μου	σου	αρέσει;	[i	dhikí	mu	su	arési?].	Σου	αρέσει	η	δική	μου;	Very	good.		
	
	 “I	give”,	I	give,	was,	δίνω	[dhíno].	Δίνω.		
	
S:	 Δίνω.

S:	 Να	σου	τους	δώσω;	[na	su	tus	dhóso?].

S:	 Να	σου	δώσω	τα	δικά	μου;	[na	su	dhóso	ta	dhiká	mu?].

S:	 Ας	τον	δώσουμε	[as	ton	dhósume].

T:	 Very	good.	Πού	είναι	η	δική	μου;	Because,	“Where	is	my	one?”	is	like,	“Where	is	
    she?”,	no,	not,	“Where	is	her?”	So,	η	δική	μου.	Πού	είναι	η	δική	μου;	I	want	my	
    one.	Still	feminine.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	την	δική	μου	[thélo	tin	dhikí	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλω	την	δική	μου.	I	want	my	ones.	Feminine	still.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	τις	δικές	μου	[thélo	tis	dhikés	mu].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	τις	δικές	μου.	Where	are	my	my	ones?	Still	feminine.		
	
S:	 Πού	είναι	οι	δικές	μου;	[pu	íne	i	dhikés	mu?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	είναι	οι	δικές	μου;	Οι	δικές	μου	πού	είναι;	[i	dhikés	mu	pu	íne?].	
    So	we’ve	seen	a	lot	of	information,	no,	about	how	nouns	behave	and	can	change.	
    And	 the	 way	 we	 are	 weaving	 it	 together	 doesn’t	 lend	 itself	 very	 well	 to	
    memorisation.	 Luckily,	 we’re	 not	 memorising,	 no?	 So	 it	 might	 be	 hard	 to	 grasp	
    what	we’ve	done	looking	back,	no?	And	it	might	feel	a	bit	scattered	all	over	the	
    place,	but	don’t	try	to	reorder	what	we	did.	Just	when	you	want	to	say	something,	
    and	 with	 the	 individual	 examples	 we	 worked	 through,	 you’ll	 think	 about	 what’s	
    relevant	 for	 that	 specific	 thing	 that	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 rather	 than	 trying	 to	 recall	
    the	 entire	 panorama	 of	 what	 nouns	 might	 do	 in	 Greek.	 And	 we	 are	 making	
    connections	 to	 allow	 you	 to	 do	 that	 –	 to	 think	 about	 the	 noun	 that	 you	 have	 in	
    front	of	you,	and	to	put	it	into	the	right	case,	which	is	what	this	phenomenon	is	
    called,	 the	 way	 these	 nouns	 change.	 In	 grammatical	 terminology,	 it’s	 called	
    “case”.

Teacher:	What	is,	I	leave,	like	leaving	something	or	leaving	somebody?		
	
Student:	Αφήνω	[afíno].		
	
T:	 Αφήνω.	And	the	closed	version	of,	αφήνω?		
	
S:	 Αφήσω	[afíso].		
	
T:	 Αφήσω.	“Outside”	was	έξω	[ékso],	like	“exodus”.	Έξω.		
	
S:	 Έξω.		
	
T:	 I	have	left	them	outside.	And	let’s	talk	about	masculine	or	mixed	things.	I’ve	left	
    them	outside.		
	
S:	 Τους	έχω	αφήσει	έξω	[tus	ékho	afísi	ékso].		
	
T:	 Good.	Τους	έχω	αφήσει	έξω.	And	of	course	this	could	also	refer	to	people,	not	just	
    things.	Like,	I’ve	left	them	(people)	outside.	Τους	έχω	αφήσει	έξω.	I	have	left	them	
    by	themselves.		
	
S:	 Τους	έχω	αφήσει	μόνοι	τους	[tus	ékho	afísi	móni	tus].		
	
T:	 Good.	 But	 here,	 μόνοι	 [móni],	 is	 it	 behaving	 like	 “they”,	 or	 is	 it	 behaving	 like	
    “them”?	I	have	left	them.	Well,	we	have	some	clues	there,	no?		
	
S:	 Okay,	so	it’s:	Τους	έχω	αφήσει	μόνους	τους	[tus	ékho	afísi	mónus	tus].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Τους	 έχω	 αφήσει	 μόνους	 τους.	 So	 here	 we	 have	 to	 change,	 μόνους	
    [mónus],	 to	 show	 that	 it’s	 “them”,	 rather	 than	 “they”,	 which	 would	 be,	 μόνοι	
    [móni].	So	if	we	were	to	say	something	like,	They	have	done	it	by	themselves,	“by	
    themselves”,	there,	is	like	“they”	or	like	“them”?		
	
S:	 They.		
	
T:	 They,	 no?	 So	 in	 that	 case,	 we	 would	 say,	 μόνοι	 τους,	 no?	 Το	 έχουν	 κάνει	 μόνοι	
    τους	[to	ékhun	káni	móni	tus].	But	here,	I	have	left	them	by	themselves,	that’s	like	
    “them”.	 You	 could	 say,	 I	 have	 left	 my	 ones	 at	 home.	 Let’s	 talk	 about	 masculine

S:	 Έχω	αφήσει	τους	δικούς	μου	στο	σπίτι	[ékho	afísi	tus	dhikús	mu	sto	spíti].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Έχω	 αφήσει	 τους	 δικούς	 μου	 στο	 σπίτι.	 Good.	 You	 could	 say,	 “Αχ”

S:	 Για	τις	νέες	μου	φίλες	[ya	tis	nées	mu	fíles].		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 no?	 Νέος	 [néos],	 you	 will	 make	 plural	 in	 the	 same	 way	 like	 the

    Very	good.	“The	coffee”	in	Greek	was,	ο	καφές	[o	kafés].	Ο	καφές.		
	
S:	 Ο	καφές.		
	
T:	 And	 this	 isn’t	 the	 plural,	 no,	 the	 S	 (ς)	 on	 καφές	 –	 it’s	 the	 masculine	 ending.	 Ο

                                                                                                244

T:	 Good.	 “This	 the	 coffee”.	 Αυτός	 ο	 καφές.	 Good.	 This	 coffee	 is	 for	 my	 friend,	
    masculine	friend.		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	καφές	είναι	για	τον	φίλο	μου	[aftós	o	kafés	íne	ya	ton	fílo	mu.]		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτός	ο	καφές	είναι	για	τον	φίλο	μου.	Or	we	could	just	say,	“this	one”,	no?	
    This	one	is	for	my	friend.	And	if	we	mean	“the	coffee”,	This	one	is	for	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	είναι	για	τον	φίλο	μου	[aftós	íne	ya	ton	fílo	mu].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	 είναι	 για	 τον	 φίλο	 μου.	 The	 plural	 of	 καφές,	 is	 καφέδες	 [kafédhes].	
    Kαφέδες.		
	
S:	 Kαφέδες.		
	
T:	 This	 [dhes]	 (-δες)	 plural	 ending,	 you	 will	 see	 it	 around	 for	 words	 of	 different	
    gender.	 Like	 “-έδες”	 [-édhes]	 for	 καφέδες	 [kafédhes],	 or	 “-άδες”	 [-ádhes],	 for	
    example	in	“γιαγιά”	[yayá],	which	means	“grandmother”.	And	the	plural,	meaning	
    “grandmothers”,	or	just	“old	ladies”:	γιαγιάδες	[yayádhes].	Γιαγιάδες.		
	
S:	 Γιαγιάδες.		
	
T:	 So	 you	 can	 find	 this	 [dhes]	 (-δες)	 plural	 ending	 with	 masculine	 and	 feminine.	 So	
    we	have	καφέδες	(coffees).	How	would	you	say,	Τhese	coffees	are	for	my	friends,	
    masculine	friends?	These	coffees	are	for	my	friends.		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	οι	καφέδες	είναι	για	τους	φίλους	μου	[aftí	i	kafédhes	íne	ya	tus	fílus	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 very	 good.	 Αυτοί	 οι	 καφέδες	 είναι	 για	 τους	 φίλους	 μου.	 Or,	 για	 τις	
    φίλες	μου	[ya	tis	fíles	mu],	for	feminine.	So	the	change	we	saw	in	the	noun,	in	the	
    masculine	plural,	when	the	noun’s	behaving	like	“them”	–	so,	for	example	in,	τους	
    φίλους	μου	–	only	happens	with	these	O-S	nouns,	the	ones	ending	“-OS”	(-ος).	So	
    if	 you	 have	 a	 masculine	 noun	 ending,	 for	 example	 “-ES”	 (-ες),	 like	 καφέδες	
    [kafédhes],	 we	 don’t	 make	 any	 change	 to	 the	 noun	 when	 it’s	 behaving	 like	
    “them”.	They	remain	as	they	are	in	the	plural.	So	for	example,	if	you	say,	I	want	
    two	coffees,	the	word	for	“two”,	like	in	duplicate,	like	in	duo?		
	
S:	 Δύο	[dhío].		
	
T:	 Δύο.	So,	I	want	two	coffees?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	δύο	καφέδες	[thélo	dhío	kafédhes].		
	
T:	 So	we	don’t	have	any	change	to	καφέδες.	We	are	waiting	for	our	coffees.		


                                                                                             245
	
S:	 Περιμένουμε	 καφέδες	 μας	 [periménume	 kafédhes	 mas].	 Περιμένουμε	 τους	
    καφέδες	μας	[periménume	tus	kafédhes	mas].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Περιμένουμε	 τους	 καφέδες	 μας.	 You	 might	 also	 say	 for	 more	
    emphasis,	 like,	 you	 know,	 “our	 coffees”,	 then	 you	 could	 say,	 “our	 own	 coffees”.	
    You	 could	 use	 that	 word	 “δικός”	 [dhikós].	 So	give	 that	 a	 try.	We	 are	 waiting	 for	
    our	own	coffees.		
	
S:	 Περιμένουμε	τους	δικούς	μας	καφέδες	[periménume	tus	dhikús	mas	kafédhes].		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 very	 good.	 Περιμένουμε	 τους	 δικούς	 μας	 καφέδες.	 Very	 good.	 I’m	
    waiting	for	my	coffee.	I’m	awaiting	my	coffee.		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	 τον	 καφές	 μου	 ...	 τον	 καφέ	 μου	 [periméno	 ton	 kafés	 mu	 …	 ton	 kafé	
    mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Περιμένω	 τον	 καφέ	 μου	 [periméno	 ton	 kafé	 mu].	 So	 all	 masculine	 nouns	
    lose	their	S	(ς),	no,	when	they	are	behaving	like	“him”,	rather	than	“he”,	no?	But	
    when	the	masculine	plural	noun	is	behaving	like	“them”,	rather	than	“they”,	only	
    the	 ones	 ending	 O-S	 (-ος)	 become	 “-ους”,	 no?	 So	 we	 lose	 the	 S	 (ς)	 from	 καφές.	
    Περιμένω	 τον	 καφέ	 μου.	 We	 also	 saw	 “the	 man”,	 ο	 άντρας	 [o	 ándras],	 like	 in	
    Alexander,	like	in	Andrew,	Andreas,	no?	O	άντρας.	“The	man”.		
	
S:	 O	άντρας.		
	
T:	 I	see.	What	is,	I	see?		
	
S:	 Βλέπω	[vlépo].		
	
T:	 Βλέπω.	I	see	the	man.		
	
S:	 Βλέπω	τον	άντρα	[vlépo	ton	ándra].		
	
T:	 Βλέπω	τον	άντρα.	“OI”	(οι)	is	what	-OS	(-ος)	nouns	do	to	become	plural:	δρόμος,	
    δρόμοι	 [dhrómos,	 dhrómi].	 But	 if	 the	 noun	 ends	 -AS	 (-ας),	 like	 άντρας,	 we	 get	
    άντρες	[ándres].		
	
S:	 Άντρες.		
	
T:	 I	see	the	men?		
	
S:	 Βλέπω	τους	άντρες	[vlépo	tus	ándres].		
	
T:	 Good.	Ah,	it’s	not	like	an	-OS	noun;	you	don’t	have	to	worry	about	changing	the	
    noun	for	“they”	or	“them”,	no?	You	just	make	it	plural.	Βλέπω	τους	άντρες.	What	
    was,	the	coffee,	again?		


                                                                                             246

S:	 Έχεις	τον	λογαριασμό;	[échis	ton	loghariazmó?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχεις	τον	λογαριασμό;	Good.	And	I	should	also	mention	that	in	Greek,	
    in	written	Greek,	you	won’t	see	a	question	mark	at	the	end,	but	a	semicolon	(;),	
    that	punctation	mark	that	looks	like	a	dot	with	a	comma	beneath	it.	That’s	used	
    for	the	question	mark	in	Greek.

Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	day?		
	
Student:	Μέρα	[méra].		
	
T:	 Μέρα.	Good.	Or,	η	μέρα	[i	méra],	the	day.	Or,	a	day?		
	
S:	 Mία	μέρα	[mía	méra].		
	
T:	 Mία	μέρα.	And	how	would	you	say,	days?		
	
S:	 Μέρες	[méres].		
	
T:	 Μέρες.	Good.	Or,	 οι	 μέρες	 [i	 méres].	And	this	 time	[i]	 spelt	like	 “OI”	 (οι),	rather	
    than	the	[i]	sound	of,	η	μέρα	[i	méra],	which	is	like	the	“n”	that	goes	down	below	
    the	line	(η).	For	plural	[i]	we	get	“OI”,	so	η	μέρα,	οι	μέρες	[i	méra,	i	méres].	So	this	
    is	 the	 main	 plural	 pattern,	 no,	 for	 feminine	 nouns,	 like	 A	 (α)	 to	 ES	 (ες)	 –	 μέρα,	
    μέρες.	But	we	do	find	other	plural	patterns.	For	example,	what	was	the	word	for,	
    city?		
	
S:	 Πόλη	[póli].		
	
T:	 And	do	you	remember	how	to	say,	cities?		
	
S:	 Πόλεις	[pólis].		
	
T:	 Πόλεις.	Good.	Οι	πόλεις	[i	pólis].	So	this	is	just	like	ending	in	S	(ς)	to,	πόλη	–	πόλη,	
    πόλεις	[póli,	pólis],	but	this	is	spelt	EIS	(εις),	this	plural	ending.	What	was	the	word	
    for	big,	related	to	“mega”,	in	English?		
	
S:	 Μεγάλος	[meghálos].		
	
T:	 Μεγάλος,	with	γάμα	[gháma]	(Γ/γ),	μεγάλος.	How	would	you	say,	big	city?		
	
S:	 Μεγάλη	πόλη	[megháli	póli].		
	
T:	 Μεγάλη	πόλη.	Very	good.	And,	big	cities?		
	
S:	 Μεγάλοι	πόλεις	[megháli	pólis].		
	
T:	 Why	“μεγάλοι	πόλεις”?		
	
S:	 Oh,	it’s,	μεγάλες	πόλεις	[megháles	pólis].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Mεγάλες	 πόλεις.	 But	 actually	 I	 did	 this	 on	 purpose,	 no?	 So	 that	 you	
    have	 to	 think	 about	 each	 one	 separately,	 because,	 μεγάλες	 πόλεις,	 they’re	


                                                                                                248
   agreeing,	 no?	 We	 have	 the	 plural	 feminine	 μεγάλες	 [megháles],	 and	 then	 the	
   plural	feminine	πόλεις	[pólis].	They’re	agreeing	in	meaning,	but	not	in	sound.	So	
   we	don’t	want	to	get	automatic;	that	can	happen	very	easily,	no,	and	say,	μεγάλες	
   πόλες	 [megháles	 póles]	 or,	 μεγάλεις	 πόλεις	 [meghális	 pólis].	 We	 want	 to	 go	
   slowly,	μεγάλες	πόλεις	[megháles	pólis],	dealing	with	each	word	separately.	How	
   would	you	say,	I	don’t	like	big	cities?	In	Greek,	you	would	say,	I	don’t	like	the	big	
   cities.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	αρέσουν	οι	μεγάλες	πόλεις	[dhen	mu	arésun	i	megháles	pólis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μου	αρέσουν	οι	μεγάλες	πόλεις.	Good.	And	it’s,	οι	μεγάλες	πόλεις,	
    because	it’s	behaving	like	“they”,	no,	rather	than	“them”.	I	don’t	like	the	big	cities.	
    The	big	cities	don’t	please	me.	Δεν	μου	αρέσουν	οι	μεγάλες	πόλεις.	“More”,	as	in	
    “more	often”	–	what	was	the	word	for,	more,	as	in	“more	often”?		
	
S:	 Πιο	συχνά	[pyo	sikhná].		
	
T:	 Πιο	[pyo].	Good.	Πιο.		
	
S:	 Πιο.		
	
T:	 If	you	want	to	say	“bigger”,	you	can	just	say,	more	big.		
	
S:	 Πιο	μεγάλο	[pyo	meghálo].		
	
T:	 Πιο	μεγάλο.	Good.	And	that	refers	to	something	neuter,	no?	Πιο	μεγάλο.	What	if	
    you	were	referring	to	something	masculine?		
	
S:	 Πιο	μεγάλος	[pyo	meghálos].		
	
T:	 Πιο	μεγάλος.	Good.	And	this	can	also	mean	“old”,	or	“older”:	μεγάλος	[meghálos]	
    (old),	 or	 πιο	 μεγάλος	 [pyo	 meghálos]	 (older).	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 This	 one	 is	
    bigger?	And	we	mean	a	feminine	thing.	This	one	is	bigger.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	πιο	μεγάλη	[aftí	íne	pyo	megháli].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτή	είναι	πιο	μεγάλη.	So,	αυτή	[aftí]	(this),	can	just	be	“this	one”,	no,	
    by	itself.	Αυτή	είναι	πιο	μεγάλη.	What	was	the	word	for,	there?		
	
S:	 Εκεί	[ekí].		
	
T:	 Εκεί.	And,	that	one?		
	
S:	 Εκείνος	[ekínos].		
	
T:	 Εκείνος,	for	masculine,	no?	And	for	neuter?		
	


                                                                                         249
S:	 Εκείνο	[ekíno].		
	
T:	 Εκείνο.	Good.	The	word	for	“than”	is	the	same	as	the	word	for	“from”.	So	how	do	
    you	say	the	word,	from,	in	Greek?		
	
S:	 Άπο	[ápo].		
	
T:	 Από	[apó],	with	the	accent	on	the	end,	από.		
	
S:	 Από	[apó].		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 we	 could	 say,	 This	 one	 is	 bigger	 than	 that	 one.	 So,	 let’s	 talk	 about	 a	
    neuter	thing.	This	one	is	bigger	than	that	one.		
	
S:	 Αυτό	είναι	πιό	μεγάλο	από	εκείνο	[aftó	íne	pyo	meghálo	apó	ekíno].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Αυτό	 είναι	 πιό	 μεγάλο	 από	 εκείνο.	 Very	 good.	 So,	 πιό	 μεγάλο	 [pyo	
    meghálo]	is	“more	big”	or	“bigger”.	If	we	say,	“the	more	big”,	το	πιό	μεγάλο	[to	
    pyo	meghálo],	we	get	“the	biggest”,	or	“the	biggest	one”.	Tο	πιό	μεγάλο.		
	
S:	 Tο	πιό	μεγάλο.		
	
T:	 Good.	And	how	would	that	be	if	we	were	talking	about	a	masculine	thing?		
	
S:	 Ο	πιό	μεγάλος	[o	pyo	meghálos].		
	
T:	 Ο	πιό	μεγάλος.	So,	πιό	[pyo],	doesn’t	change	depending	on	the	gender,	no?	It	just	
    means	 “more”.	 Ο	 πιό	 μεγάλος,	 “the	 more	 big”.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 want	 the	
    biggest	one	(the	most	big)?	Talking	about	the	neuter	thing?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	το	πιό	μεγάλο	[thélo	to	pyo	meghálo].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλω	το	πιό	μεγάλο.	And	talking	about	a	masculine	thing?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	τον	πιό	μεγάλο	[thélo	ton	pyo	meghálo].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 τον	 πιό	 μεγάλο.	 And	 “μεγάλος”	 lost	 its	 S	 (ς)	 there,	 no,	 because	 it’s	
    like	“him”,	rather	than	“he”.	I	want	the	biggest	one.	I	want	the	biggest	him,	not,	
    the	biggest	he.	Θέλω	τον	πιό	μεγάλο.	And	a	feminine	thing.	We	want	the	biggest	
    one	(the	most	big).		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	την	πιό	μεγάλη	[thélume	tin	pyo	megháli].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θέλουμε	 την	 πιό	 μεγάλη.	 Very	 good.	 The	 word	 for	 “cheap”	 is	 φτηνό	
    [ftinó].	Φτηνό.		
	
S:	 Φτηνό.		


                                                                                               250
T:	 And	the	word	for	something?		
	
S:	 Κάτι	[káti].		
	
T:	 Κάτι.	We	want	something	cheaper.	We	want	something	more	cheap.		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	κάτι	πιό	φτηνό	[thélume	káti	pyo	ftinó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλουμε	κάτι	πιό	φτηνό.	We	want	the	cheapest	one	that	you	have.	So,	
    the	first	bit	is,	We	want	the	cheapest	one.	We	want	the	most	cheap.		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	το	πιό	φτηνό	[thélume	to	pyo	ftinó].		
	
T:	 Θέλουμε	 το	 πιό	 φτηνό.	 That	 you	 have.	 Which	 “that”	 is	 this?	 This	 is	 “that”,	 like	
    “which”.	Which	you	have?		
	
S:	 Που	[pu].		
	
T:	 Που.	Good.	So	we	saw	two	ways	of	saying	that.	We	saw	ότι	[óti],	like	in,	“I	think	
    that”,	 for	 example,	 and	 then	 we	 saw	 που	 [pu],	 like	 “which”.	 So,	 We	 want	 the	
    cheapest	one	that	you	have.		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	το	πιό	φτηνό	που	...	που	έχεις	[thélume	to	pyo	ftinó	pu	…	pu	échis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλουμε	το	πιό	φτηνό	που	έχεις	[thélume	to	pyo	ftinó	 pu	échis].	So	
    this	is	neuter,	no,	το	πιό	φτηνό	[to	pyo	ftinó].	What	if	we	were	to	say,	We	want	
    the	cheapest	ones	that	you	have,	still	neuter.	So	the	neuter	plural.	We	want	the	
    cheapest	ones	that	you	have.		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	τα	πιό	φτηνά	που	έχεις	[thélume	ta	pyo	ftiná	pu	échis].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλουμε	τα	πιό	φτηνά	που	έχεις.	Other	than	“more	big”,	πιό	μεγάλος	[pyo	
    meghálos],	we	could	also	say,	μεγαλύτερος	[meghalíteros].	Μεγαλύτερος.		
	
S:	 Μεγαλύτερος.		
	
T:	 So	the	[-os]	(-ος)	ending	can	change	to	[-íteros]	(-ύτερος),	and	we	get	“bigger”	or	
    “biggest”.	 Μεγάλος,	 μεγαλύτερος	 [meghálos,meghalíteros].	 So	 how	 would	 you	
    say,	They	want	something	bigger?		
	
S:	 Θέλουνε	κάτι	μεγαλύτερο	[thélune	káti	meghalítero].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλουν,	θέλουνε	κάτι	μεγαλύτερο	[thélun,	thélune	káti	meghalítero].	Κάτι	
    [káti]	 is	 neuter,	 let’s	 say,	 no?	 Something.	 Θέλουν	 κάτι	 μεγαλύτερο	 [thélun	 káti	
    meghalítero].	What	was,	cheap?		
	
S:	 Φτηνό	[ftinó].		


                                                                                             251
	
T:	 Φτηνό.	 Φτηνό	 has	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 end,	 so	 it’s	 slightly	 different	 when	 we	 say	
    “cheaper”.	We	have,	φτηνότερος	[ftinóteros].	Φτηνότερος.		
	
S:	 Φτηνότερος.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	They	want	something	cheaper?		
	
S:	 Θέλουνε	κάτι	φτηνότερο	[thélune	káti	ftinótero].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλουνε	κάτι	φτηνότερο.	They	want	the	cheapest	one?	Let’s	say	it’s	a	
    masculine	one	we’re	talking	about.	They	want	the	cheapest	one.		
	
S:	 Θέλουνε	τον	φτηνότερο	[thélune	ton	ftinótero].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλουν,	θέλουνε	τον	φτηνότερο	[thélun,	thélune	ton	ftinótero].	Very	
    good.	So,	φτηνότερο	[ftinótero]	there	is	also,	φτηνότερος	[ftinóteros],	without	the	
    S	(-ς).	This	one	is	cheaper	than	that	one	–	feminine.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	φτηνότερη	από	εκείνη	[aftí	íne	ftinóteri	apó	ekíni].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	είναι	φτηνότερη	από	εκείνη.		
	
	 Η	τιμή	[i	timí],	η	τιμή,	is	“the	price”.	Η	τιμή.		
	
S:	 Η	τιμή.		
	
T:	 And	also	“the	honour”,	the	honour,	is	also,	η	τιμή.	And	it	has	the	same	spelling,	
    exactly	the	same	spelling,	so	we	might	assume	it’s	exactly	the	same	word.	Maybe	
    your	price	is	your	honour.	Η	τιμή.		
	
S:	 Η	τιμή.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	It	is	a	good	price?		
	
S:	 Είναι	καλή	τιμή	[íne	kalí	timí].		
	
T:	 Είναι	καλή	τιμή.	Καλή	τιμή	είναι	[kalí	timí	íne].	In	Greek	you	can	also	put	“είναι”	
    afterwards,	no,	for	more	emphasis.	Καλή	τιμή	είναι.	A	good	price,	it	is.	How	would	
    you	say,	a	better	price?	So,	καλή	[kalí]	is	“good”.	How	would	you	say,	better,	more	
    good?		
	
S:	 Καλύτερη	[kalíteri].		
	
T:	 Καλύτερη.	Or,	πιό	καλή	[pyo	kalí].	So,	a	better	price?		
	
S:	 Καλύτερη	τιμή	[kalíteri	timí].		


                                                                                            252
	
T:	 Good.	Καλύτερη	τιμή.	Μία	καλύτερη	τιμή	[mía	kalíteri	timí].	Προτιμώ	[protimó],	
    προτιμώ,	is	“I	prefer”.		
	
S:	 Προτιμώ.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	something	like,	“I	first	honour”,	or	something	like	this,	no?	Προ-τιμώ,	like	
    τιμή	 [timí].	 So,	 “I	 first	 honour”,	 something	 like	 this.	 Προτιμώ,	 “I	 prefer”.	 How	
    would	you	say,	I	prefer	the	cheap	one?	Let’s	talk	about	a	masculine	thing.	I	prefer	
    the	cheap	one.		
	
S:	 Προτιμώ	το	...	τον	φτηνότερο	[protimó	to	…	ton	ftinótero].		
	
T:	 That	would	be,	I	prefer	the	cheapest	one,	but	just,	I	prefer	the	cheap	one.		
	
S:	 Προτιμώ	τον	φτηνό	[protimó	ton	ftinó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Προτιμώ	τον	φτηνό.	I	should	also	mention	that	you	might	see	“φτηνό”	
    [ftinó]	 as	 “φθηνό”	 [fthinó].	 So	 instead	 of	 F-T-I-N-O,	 F-TH-I-N-O.	 And	 there’s	 a	
    couple	of	words	like	this,	that	have	alternative	forms	in	Greek.	Like,	χθές	[khthés],	
    “yesterday”,	 and	 χτες	 [khtes],	 “yesterday”.	 So	 you	 might	 see	 that.	 I	 prefer	 the	
    cheap	ones.	Still	masculine.	I	prefer	the	cheap	ones.		
	
S:	 Προτιμώ	τα	φτηνά	[protimó	ta	ftiná].		
	
T:	 Good.	 This	 would	 be	 for	 neuter	 things,	 no?	 Προτιμώ	 τα	 φτηνά.	 And	 how	 about	
    masculine	things?		
	
S:	 Προτιμώ	τους	φτηνούς	[protimó	tus	ftinús].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Προτιμώ	 τους	 φτηνούς.	 I	 prefer	 the	 cheap	 ones.	 Προτιμώ	 τους	
    φτηνούς.	 And,	 I	 prefer	 the	 cheapest	 ones,	 still	 masculine?	 I	 prefer	 the	 cheapest	
    ones.		
	
S:	 Προτιμώ	τους	φτηνότερους	[protimó	tus	ftinóterus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Προτιμώ	τους	φτηνότερους.	And	if	you	don’t	want	to	think	your	way	
    through,	φτηνότερους	[ftinóterus],	you	don’t	have	to.	You	can	also	say,	προτιμώ	
    τους	πιό	φτηνούς	[protimó	tus	pyo	ftinús].	Very	good.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	give?		
	
Student:	Δίνω	[dhíno].		
	
T:	 Δίνω.	And	the	closed	version	of,	δίνω?		
	
S:	 Δώσω	[dhóso].		
	
T:	 Δώσω.	Very	good.	So	we	still	have	an	N	(ν)	to	an	S	(σ),	which	is	quite	common,	no?	
    But	 there’s	 another	 change	 going	 on	 there.	 We	 have	 a	 changing	 vowel,	 δίνω,	
    δώσω	[dhíno,	dhóso].	How	would	you	say,	I	have	given	it	to	him.	Or,	I	have	given	
    him	it,	in	Greek,	no?		
	
S:	 Τον	το	έχω	δώσει	[ton	to	ékho	dhósi].		
	
T:	 So	apart	from	thinking	about,	okay,	do	we	mean	“him”	or	“to	him”,	no,	also,	when	
    we	have	another	little	word	like	“το”	[to],	it’s	necessarily	going	to	be	“to	him”,	no?	
    I	have	given	it	to	him.	I	have	said	it	to	him.	So	having	an	“it”	there	means	we’re	
    going	to	have	“to	him,”	“to	her.”	Always.		
	
S:	 Okay,	so:	Του	το	έχω	δώσει	[tu	to	ékho	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Good.	Του	το	έχω	δώσει.	So	having	“το”	there,	is	also	a	big	alarm	that	you	should	
    have	“του”	[tu],	and	not	“τον”	[ton],	no?	Του	το	…	Του	το	έχω	δώσει.	I	have	given	
    it	to	my	friend.	So,	now	we	don’t	have	“him”;	we	have,	“to	my	friend”,	which	is	
    like	a	separate	part	of	the	sentence.	So	the	first	bit	is,	I	have	given	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έχω	δώσει	[to	ékho	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Now	 we	 will	 say,	 “to	 my	 friend”,	 “to	 the	 friend	 my”.	 And	 let’s	 talk	 about	 the

S:	 Στου	φίλο	μου	[stu	fílo	mu].		
	
T:	 Why	“στου”	[stu]?		
	
S:	 Because	it’s	“to	the”…

T:	 Σε.	 So	 when	 we’re	 saying	 “to”,	 then	 we	 just	 need	 to	 think	 about	 whether	 the

T:	 To	him,	no?	So,	I	have	given	it	(το	έχω	δώσει),	to	my	friend.	“To	the	friend	my”.		
	
S:	 Στον	φίλο	μου	[ston	fílo	mu].		
	
T:	 Στον	φίλο	μου,	no?	But	if	we	just	say,	“I	have	given	it	to	him”,	then	we	want	to	
    include	“to	him”	–	the	meaning	of	“to	him”	–	in	just	one	word,	“του”	[tu].	Του	το	
    έχω	 δώσει	 [tu	 to	 ékho	 dhósi],	 as	 opposed	 to,	 Το	 έχω	 δώσει	 στον	 φίλο	 μου	 [to	
    ékho	dhósi	ston	fílo	mu].	I	have	given	it	to	them?	Any	gender,	no?		
	
S:	 Το	τους	έχω	δώσει	[to	tus	ékho	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Okay,	and	which	one	comes	first?		
	
S:	 Τους	το	έχω	δώσει	[tus	to	ékho	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	why?		
	
S:	 Because	the	pronoun	always	comes	first.		
	
T:	 The	personal	one,	the	one	that	refers	to	the	person	comes	first,	no?	So,	again,	I	
    have	given	it	to	them.		
	
S:	 Τους	το	έχω	δώσει.	
	
T:	 Τους	 το	 έχω	 δώσει.	 And	 of	 course	 “τους”	 [tus]	 works	 for	 any	 gender,	 for	 “to	
    them”.	Τους	το	έχω	δώσει.	I	have	given	it	to	my	friends.	So,	I	have	given	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έχω	δώσει	[to	ékho	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Το	έχω	δώσει.	Let’s	give	a	masculine	thing.		
	
S:	 Τον	έχω	δώσει	[ton	ékho	dhósi].		
	
T:	 Τον	έχω	δώσει.	To	my	friends.	To	the	friends	my.	Still	masculine.		
	
S:	 Στους	φίλους	μου	[stus	fílus	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good,	 ah.	 Στους	 φίλους	 μου.	 Σε	 τους	 φίλους	 μου	 [se	 tus	 fílus	 mu],

S:	 Μεγάλος	[meghálos].		
	
T:	 Μεγάλος.	And,	bigger?

    bought	him	the	biggest	one.	You	can	choose	the	gender	of,	the	biggest	one.	We	
    have	bought	him	the	biggest	one.		
	
S:	 So	it’s,	“bought	for	him”.		
	
T:	 Exactly.		
	
S:	 So	we	use	“του”	[tu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.		
	
S:	 Του	 έχουμε	 αγοράσει	 [tu	 ékhume	 aghorási].	 The	 biggest	 one.	 Τον	 μεγαλύτερο

T:	 Καλημέρα.	You	might	also	hear,	Καλή	όρεξη	[kalí	óreksi],	which	means	like,	“bon	
    appetit”,	 when	 you	 start	 eating.	 Καλή	 όρεξη	 –	 literally	 something	 like,	 “good	
    appetite”.	 We	 have	 this	 in	 English	 as	 well,	 “όρεξη”	 [óreksi].	 Can	 you	 find	 it?	
    Anything	come	to	mind?		
	
S:	 Anorexia?		
	
T:	 Yes,	anorexia,	no?	This	“an”	is	like,	“the	lack	of,	the	lack	of	appetite”.	And	better,	
    so,	more	good,	or	better,	from	καλός	[kalós]?		
	
S:	 Καλύτερος	[kalíteros].		
	
T:	 Καλύτερος.	And,	the	best	one?		
	
S:	 O	καλύτερος	[o	kalíteros].		
	
T:	 Good.	 For	 something	 masculine,	 ο	 καλύτερος.	 What	 was,	 I	 leave,	 like,	 “I	 leave	
    something	or	someone”?		
	
S:	 Αφήνω	[afíno].		
	
T:	 Αφήνω.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Αφήσω	[afíso].		
	
T:	 Αφήσω.	He	has	left	them	the	best	one.	He	has	left	them	(a	feminine	them).	He	has	
    left	them.		
	
S:	 Τις	έχει	αφήσει	[tis	échi	afísi].		
	
T:	 Ooh!	So	this	would	mean,	“He	has	left	them”,	rather	than,	“He	has	left	them	the	
    best	one”,	“He	has	left	them	something”.	So	here	we	want,	to	them.		
	
S:	 Ah,	then	it	becomes:	Τους	έχει	αφήσει	[tus	échi	afísi].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	even	though	it’s	feminine.	Τους	έχει	αφήσει,	no?	He	has	left	them	the

S:	 Τον	καλύτερο	[ton	kalítero].

T:	 Έχει	αφήσει	το	καλύτερο.	For	his	friends,	and	let’s	say	feminine	friends,	females.	
    For	his	friends.		


                                                                                           257
	
S:	 Για	τις	φίλες	του	[ya	tis	fíles	tu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχει	αφήσει	το	καλύτερο	για	τις	φίλες	του	[échi	afísi	to	kalítero	ya	tis	
    fíles	 tu].	 And	 we	 could	 also	 have,	 στις	 [stis]:	 στις	 φίλες	 του	 [stis	 fíles	 tu],	 “to	 his	
    friends”.	So	I	mentioned	how	we	don’t	just	rely	on	the	sentence,	but	what’s	going	
    on	 in	 the	 context,	 in	 real	 life,	 when	 we	 decide	 whether	 we	 want	 the	 “he”	 or	
    “him”,	“she”	 or	“her,”	 “they”	 or	 “them”,	 form	 of	 nouns	and	 the	 words	for	 verb,	
    no?	 So	 if	 somebody	 says,	 “What’s	 this?”	 (Τι	 είναι	 αυτο;	 [ti	 íne	 aftó?]),	 “What’s	
    this?”,	and	you	say	“coffee”,	is	this	“he”	or	“him”,	the	word	“coffee”?	So,	do	you	
    mean,	“he	is	this”	or,	“him	is	this”,	when	somebody	says,	“What’s	this?”,	and	you	
    say,	“coffee”?		
	
S:	 Ο	καφές	[o	kafés].		
	
T:	 Kαφές,	no?	It’s	like	“he”,	rather	than	“him”,	no?	This	is,	“he	is	this”,	rather	than,	
    “him	 is	 this”.	 Ο	 καφές.	 So,	 Τι	 είναι	 αυτο;	 [ti	 íne	 aftó?].	 Καφές	 [kafés],	 no?	 “It	 is	
    coffee”;	it’s	in	the	“he”	form.	Καφές	είναι	[kafés	íne],	“Coffee	it	is”.	Είναι	καφές	
    [íne	kafés],	“It	is	coffee”.	But	if	someone	says,	“What	have	you	bought?”,	Τι	έχεις	
    αγοράσει;	[ti	échis	agorási?],	and	you	say	“coffee”,	is	it	“he”	or	“him”?	So	if	I	tell	
    you,	“What	have	you	bought?”	I	have	bought	“he”	or	I	have	bought	“him”?		
	
S:	 Him.		
	
T:	 Him.	So	how	would	you	reply,	“coffee”?		
	
S:	 Καφέ	[kafé].		
	
T:	 Καφέ.	So,	like	I	said,	in	everyday	life,	no,	you	will	also	be	thinking	about	what	your	
    noun	 is	 doing,	 when	 you	 say	 it,	 how	 it’s	 behaving,	 no?	 “What’s	 this?”	 Kαφές	
    [kafés].	“What	have	you	bought?	”	Καφέ	[kafé].	How	do	you	say,	the	road?		
	
S:	 Ο	δρόμος	[o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Ο	δρόμος.	And,	the	roads?		
	
S:	 Οι	δρόμοι	[i	dhrómi].		
	
T:	 Οι	δρόμοι.	So	imagine	I	show	you	my	child’s	drawing,	and	you	say,	“What	did	she	
    draw?”	And	I	reply,	“roads”.	How	will	I	reply	it?		
	
S:	 Δρόμοι	[dhrómi].		
	
T:	 Did	she	draw	“they”,	or	did	she	draw	“them”?		
	
S:	 She	drew	them,	so	it’s,	δρόμους	[dhrómus].		
	


                                                                                                      258
T:	 Δρόμους.	 What	 did	 she	 draw?	 Δρόμους.	 But	 you	 will	 also	 find	 that	 people’s	
    brains,	 subconsciously,	 are	 a	 bit	 lazy,	 and	 actually	 it’s	 more	 mental	 effort	 to	
    retrieve	“δρόμους”	than	“δρόμοι”.	So	you	might	find	people	saying,	Δρόμοι	είναι	
    [dhrómi	íne],	“Roads	it	is”.	And	subconsciously	the	mind	just	can’t	be	bothered	to	
    go	and	find	“δρόμους”.	Δρόμοι	είναι.	So	you	can	do	that	too.

T:	 Yeah.	Or,	the	Maria,	no?		
	
S:	 Ah.	H	Mαρία	[i	maría].		
	
T:	 H	Mαρία,	no?	So,	in	Greek,	we	say,	η	Mαρία.	Well	also	now	we	know,	not	always.	
    If	 we	 say,	 η	 Mαρία,	 it’s	 Maria	 in	 “she”	 position,	 no?	 What	 about	 when	 it’s	
    behaving	like	“her”?		
	
S:	 Την	Mαρία	[tin	maría].		
	
T:	 Την	Mαρία,	no?	So	names	behave	like	any	other	nouns	in	Greek,	no?	H	Mαρία	[i	
    maría],	for	when	it’s	behaving	like	“she”.	So,	Maria	is	eating?		
	
S:	 H	Mαρία	τρώω	...	τρώει	[i	maría	tróo	...	trói].

T:	 H	Mαρία	δεν	θέλει	να	φάει.	But,	of	course,	if	we	have	Maria	behaving	like	“her”,

S:	 Έχεις	δει	την	Μαρία;	[échis	dhi	tin	maría?].		
	
T:	 Έχεις	δει	την	Μαρία;	I	haven’t	seen	her	for	ages.	For	“ages”,	you	could	say,	πολύ	
    καιρό	 [polí	 keró].	 So,	 καιρός	 [kerós],	 is	 another	 word	 for	 “time”.	 So	 we	 saw,	
    χρόνος	 [khrónos],	 which	 means	 “year”,	 or	 time	 generally,	 like	 a	 concept,	 which	
    maybe	you	would	use	to	say	something	like,	“time	is	cruel”,	no,	or	something	like	
    this	 to	 talk	 about	 time	 as	 a	 concept.	 But	 then,	 with	 periods	 of	 time,	 like,	 “for	
    ages”,	we	have	καιρός.	So	we	can	say,	πολύ	καιρό,	for	a	lot	of	time.	So	why	do	we	
    have	καιρό	[keró]	here,	and	not	καιρός	[kerós]?		
	
S:	 Because,	Εγώ	έχω	τον	καιρό	[eghó	ékho	ton	keró].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	It’s	like,	“I	have	him”,	no,	rather	than,	“I	have	he”.	So,	καιρός	loses	its	S	
    (ς),	and	we	get	καιρό.	So,	I	have	a	lot	of	time,	να	[na],	I	see	her.	I	haven’t	seen	her	
    for	ages.		
	
S:	 Έχω	πολύ	καιρό	να	...	να	την	δω	[ékho	polí	keró	na	…	na	tin	dho].

                                                                                               261
T:	 Good.	 Με	 ξέρει	 η	 Μαρία.	 Η	 Μαρία	 με	 ξέρει	 [i	 maría	 me	 kséri].	 So	 I	 mentioned	
    how	we	have	so	much	flexibility	in	Greek	as	well,	partly	because	of	the	way	nouns	
    change,	 no?	 Because	 we	 know	 straight	 away	 how	 the	 noun	 is	 behaving	 in	 the	
    sentence,	 we	 can	 pretty	 much	 put	 it	 anywhere.	 Η	 Μαρία	 με	 ξέρει.	 Με	 ξέρει	 η	
    Μαρία.	So	we’ve	seen	that	names	function	like	any	nouns,	and	change,	depending	
    on	how	they	are	behaving	–	what	they	are	doing	in	a	sentence.	So	when	we	say,	
    for	 example,	 O	 Μιχάλης	 [o	 mikhális],	 no	 –	 “the	 Michalis”	 –	 it’s	 in	 “he”	 function,	
    no?	It’s	behaving	like	“he”.	So	if	we	say,	for	example,	Michalis	is	waiting?		
	
S:	 O	Μιχάλης	περιμένει	[o	mikhális	periméni].		
	
T:	 O	Μιχάλης	περιμένει.	And,	I’m	waiting	for	Michalis?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	τον	Μιχάλη	[periméno	ton	mikháli].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Περιμένω	 τον	 Μιχάλη.	 So,	 O	 Μιχάλης	 [o	 mikhális]	 –	 “o”	 becomes,	
    “τον”	[ton],	no,	as	it’s	behaving	like	“him”.	And	also	we	lose	the	S	(ς)	of	Μιχάλης.	
    Περιμένω	τον	Μιχάλη.	Have	you	told	Michalis?	Have	you	told	it	to	the	Michalis?	
    So,	Have	you	told	it?		
	
S:	 Το	έχεις	πει;	[to	échis	pi?].		
	
T:	 To	the	Michalis.		
	
S:	 Στον	Μιχάλη	[ston	mikháli].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Το	 έχεις	 πει	 στον	 Μιχάλη;	 [to	 échis	 pi	 ston	 mikháli?].	 Very	 good.	 It’s	
    also	possible	to	hear,	του	Μιχάλη	[tu	mikháli],	instead	of,	στον	Μιχάλη.	This	isn’t	
    as	common	as,	στον	Μιχάλη,	and	you’ll	notice	again	that	it	will	depend	a	lot	on	
    dialect	 and	 ideolect,	 on	 individual	 dialect.	 But	 you	 could	 hear,	 Το	 έχεις	 πει	 του	
    Μιχάλη;	[to	échis	pi	tu	mikháli?],	including	in	“του	Μιχάλη”,	the	whole	meaning	of	
    “to	the	Michalis”.	But	as	I	mentioned,	the	brain	is	quite	lazy,	generally,	when	it’s	
    speaking,	and	it	costs	more	energy	to	retrieve	“του”.	It’s	actually	easier	to	build,	
    στον	 [ston]	 to	 “the”.	 So	 you	 will	 hear	 that	 much	 more	 commonly:	 Το	 έχεις	 πει	
    στον	Μιχάλη,	rather	than,	Το	έχεις	πει	του	Μιχάλη.	Γιώργος	[yórghos],	Γιώργος,	is	
    another	common	name.	Γιώργος.		
	
S:	 Γιώργος.		
	
T:	 Here	 we	 have	 γάμα	 [gháma]	 (γ)	 at	 the	 beginning,	 “Γιώρ”	 [yor],	 but	 it	 is	 like	 Y,	
    because	it	has	a	[i]	sound	afterward.	And	we	have	the	γάμα	again	for	“γος”	[ghos],	
    no?	So,	in	this	name,	we	see	the	two	different	pronunciations	of	γάμα	(γ)	as	well:	
    Γιώργος”	[yórghos].		
	
S:	 Γιώργος.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	Giorgos	has	to	see	it.

    dhi	o	yórghos].	How	would	you	say,	He	has	to	see	Giorgos?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	δει	τον	Γιώργο	[prépi	na	dhi	ton	yórgho].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πρέπει	να	δει	τον	Γιώργο.	So	here	we	have	“O	Γιώργος”	behaving	like	
    “him”	–	τον	Γιώργο.	He	has	to	see	Giorgos.	Πρέπει	να	δει	τον	Γιώργο.	How	would	
    you	say,	You	have	to	tell	him	it?	You	have	to	tell	him	it.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	του	το	πεις	[prépi	na	tu	to	pis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πρέπει	να	του	το	πεις.	Very	good.	You	have	to	tell	Giorgos	it.	You	have	
    to	tell	it	to	the	Giorgos.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	το	πεις	στον	Γιώργο	[prépi	na	to	pis	ston	yórgho].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 το	 πεις	 στον	 Γιώργο.	 And	 again	 you	 also	 might	 hear	 “του	
    Γιώργου”	 [tu	 yórghu].	 So	 -OS	 (-ος)	 nouns	 also	 change	 to	 fit	 with	 “του”.	 Tου	
    Γιώργου.	 Like	 we	 saw	 with,	 for	 example,	 “τους”	 [tus],	 no?	 Tους	 δρόμους	 [tus	
    dhrómus],	 του	 Γιώργου.	 So	 you	 could	 hear	 that:	 Πρέπει	 να	 το	 πεις	 του	 Γιώργου	
    [prépi	na	to	pis	tu	yórghu].	You	have	to	tell	it	to	Giorgos.	And	the	whole	meaning	
    of	 “to	 Giorgos”	 included	 in	 “του	 Γιώργου”,	 but	 as	 I	 mentioned,	 much	 more	
    common,	στον	Γιώργο.	Πρέπει	να	το	πεις	στον	Γιώργο.		
	
	 “I	show”,	I	show,	in	Greek	is,	δείχνω	[dhíkhno].		
	
S:	 Δείχνω.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	δέλτα	[dhélta]	(Δ/δ),	“I”	sound	([i]	sound),	and	then	the	X	(χ)	that	gives	
    us	[kh],	N-O	(ν-ω)	[no].	Δείχνω	[dh-í-kh-no].		
	
S:	 Δείχνω.		
	
T:	 The	closed	version	of	δείχνω	[dhíkhno]	is,	δείξω	[dhíkso].		
	
S:	 Δείξω.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	Ιt	will	show?		
	
S:	 Θα	δείξει	[tha	dhíksi].		
	
T:	 And,	θα	δείξει,	is	another	way	of	saying,	“We’ll	see”.	It	will	show.	Θα	δείξει.	We	
    will	 see.	 Θα	 δείξει.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 have	 something	 to	 show	 him?	 I	 have	
    something?

Teacher:	 So	 we	 saw	 μόνος	 [mónos]	 as	 “alone”,	 no?	 Μόνος,	 μόνη,	 μόνο	 [mónos,	
    móni,	móno],	and	we	can	have,	μόνος	μου	[mónos	mu],	“by	myself”.	And	we	saw,	
    δικός	[dhikós]	like,	“my	own”,	or	“my	one”.	Δικός	μου,	δικό	μου,	δική	μου	[dhikós	
    mu,	dhikó	mu,	dhikí	mu].	What	was	the	word	for,	problem?		
	
Student:	Πρόβλημα	[próvlima].		
	
T:	 Πρόβλημα.	 And	 the	 plural,	 what	 do	 we	 do	 to	 neuter	 nouns	 that	 end	 in	 A	 (α),	
    already,	to	make	them	plural?		
	
S:	 Προβλήματα	[provlímata].		
	
T:	 Προβλήματα.	So,	το	πρόβλημα	[to	próvlima]	and,	τα	προβλήματα	[ta	provlímata].	
    What	was	the	word	for,	we?	The	word	for,	we.		
	
S:	 Εμείς	[emís].		
	
T:	 Εμείς.	Good.	So,	let’s	emphasise	“we”.	We	have	our	own.	We	have	our	own.	What	
    are	we	going	to	use	for,	our	own,	talking	about	possession?		
	
S:	 Το	δικό	μας	[to	dhikó	mas].		
	
T:	 Okay,	good,	 δικός	[dhikós].	So	let’s	say,	“we	have”,	and	we	emphasize	the	word	
    for	“we”.	We	have	our	own,	and	we	mean	neuter	plural.	We	have	our	own	ones.		
	
S:	 Εμείς	έχουμε	τα	δικά	μας	[emís	ékhume	ta	dhiká	mas].		
	
T:	 Good.	Εμείς	έχουμε	τα	δικά	μας.	Let’s	say	now,	We	have	our	own	problems.	We	
    have	 our	 own	 problems.	 So	 we’re	 going	 to	 say,	 “We	 have	 our	 own	 ones	
    problems”.		
	
S:	 Εμείς	έχουμε	τα	δικά	μας	προβλήματα	[emís	ékhume	ta	dhiká	mas	provlímata].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Εμείς	έχουμε	τα	δικά	μας	προβλήματα,	no?	So	we	have,	τα	δικά	μας,	
    εμείς	έχουμε	τα	δικά	μας,	We	have	our	own	ones.	But	if	we	want	to	say,	We	have	
    our	own	problems,	Έχουμε	τα	δικά	μας	προβλήματα.	So	basically,	we	want	to	get	
    the	“μας”	[mas]	out	of	the	way	as	soon	as	we	can.	So	if	we	have	something	before	
    the	noun	(προβλήματα	[provlímata]),	like	“δικά”	[dhiká],	we	can	stick	it	in	there.	
    Tα	δικά	μας	προβλήματα.	What	was,	I	like	it,	or,	It	pleases	to	me?		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	[mu	arési].		
	
T:	 Μου	 αρέσει.	 Or,	 M’	 αρέσει	 [m’arési],	 with	 the	 contraction.	 M’αρέσει:	 M,	
    apostrophe,	αρέσει	[arési].	I	like	our	one.	Our	one	pleases	me.	And	let’s	say	it’s	a	
    masculine	thing.	I	like	our	one.		


                                                                                         265
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	ο	δικό	μας	[mu	arési	o	dhikó	mas].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	“ο	δικό”	is	kind	of	contradicting	itself,	no?		
	
S:	 O	δικός.	O	δικός	μας	[o	dhikós	mas].		
	
T:	 Good.	It’s	behaving	like	“he”,	no?	He	pleases	me.	O	δικός	μας.	Μου	αρέσει	ο	δικός	
    μας	[mu	arési	o	dhikós	mas].	O	δικός	μας	μου	αρέσει	[o	dhikós	mas	mu	arési].	So	
    we	did	this	with	a	masculine	thing,	no?	What	if	it	were	a	neuter	thing,	I	like	our	
    one.		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	το	δικό	μας	[mu	arési	to	dhikó	mas].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Μου	 αρέσει	 το	 δικό	 μας.	 And,	 I	 like	 our	 ones,	 and	 these	 are	 feminine	
    things.	I	like	our	ones.		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσουν	οι	δικές	μας	[mu	arésun	i	dhikés	mas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good,	for	changing	the	verb,	no?	Μου	αρέσουν	[mu	arésun],	They	
    please	me,	our	ones	–	Oι	δικές	μας	[i	dhikés	mas].	Μου	αρέσουν	οι	δικές	μας	[mu	
    arésun	i	dhikés	mas].	Οι	δικές	μας	μου	αρέσουν	[i	dhikés	mas	mu	arésun].	“To	be	
    absent”,	to	be	absent,	is	λείπω	[lípo].	Λείπω.		
	
S:	 Λείπω.		
	
T:	 And	we	have	this	in	English	as	well,	“Eclipse”.	In	eclipse,	we	have	this	verb,	λείπω,	
    and	of	course	eclipse	is	the	absence,	no,	of	the	sun	or	the	moon	–	a	solar	eclipse	
    or	a	lunar	eclipse.	So,	λείπω,	to	be	absent.	Maria	is	absent?		
	
S:	 Η	Μαρία	λείπει	[i	maría	lípi].		
	
T:	 Η	Μαρία	λείπει.	Good.	If	you	want	to	say	in	Greek,	“I	miss	you”,	I	miss	you,	you	
    will	say,	“You	are	absent	to	me”.	So	with	words	like	“μου	αρέσει”	[mu	arési],	no,	
    we’re	 thinking	 of,	 “to	 me”.	 It	 is	 pleasing	 to	 me.	 You	 are	 absent	 to	 me.	 So	 how	
    would	you	say	that,	I	miss	you.	You	are	absent	to	me.		
	
S:	 Μου	λείπεις	[mu	lípis].		
	
T:	 Μου	 λείπεις.	 Μου	 λείπεις.	 I	 miss	 you.	 So	 just	 like	 we	 have	 “μου”	 [mu]	 in,	 μου	
    αρέσει	[mu	arési],	because,	It	is	pleasing	to	me,	the	same	for	λείπω,	no?	You	are	
    absent	to	me.	We	miss	you.	So,	who	is	absent	to	who	in,	We	miss	you?		
	
S:	 You	are	absent	to	us.		
	
T:	 Brilliant.		
	


                                                                                              266
S:	 Μας	λείπεις	[mas	lípis].		
	
T:	 Μας	λείπεις.	Good.	So	we	have,	μας	[mas]	for	“us”,	or	“to	us”,	no?	It’s	the	same.	
    Μας	λείπεις.	He	misses	you.		
	
S:	 Σου	λείπει	[su	lípi].	Um	…	He	misses	you.	So,	you	are	absent	to	him.	Τον	λείπεις	
    [ton	lípis].		
	
T:	 To	him.		
	
S:	 Του	λείπεις	[tu	lípis].		
	
T:	 Του	λείπεις.	You	don’t	like	“του”,	huh?	Του	λείπεις.	Good.	So,	if	we	say,	Μy	friend	
    misses	you,	no,	we	would	just	say,	You	are	missing	to	my	friend.		
	
S:	 Λείπεις	στον	φίλο	μου	[lípis	ston	fílo	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Λείπεις	στον	φίλο	μου.	No?	“You	are	missing	to	the	friend	my”:	στον	
    φίλο	μου.	And	we	could	also	have,	του	φίλο	μου	[tu	fílo	mu]	again,	including	the	
    “to	the”	information	in	“του”:	του	φίλο	μου.	But	it’s	not	as	common.	Λείπεις	στον	
    φίλο	μου.	Giorgos	misses	you.	So	you	know,	you	say,	You	are	missing	to	Giorgos.		
	
S:	 Λείπεις	στον	Γιώργο	[lípis	ston	yórgho].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Λείπεις	στον	Γιώργο.	Maria	misses	you.		
	
S:	 Λείπεις	στην	Μαρία	[lípis	stin	maría].		
	
T:	 Λείπεις	 στην	 Μαρία.	 Very	 good.	 So	 if	 you	 want	 to	 find	 the	 closed	 version	 of,	
    λείπω,	no?	Give	it	a	guess,	based	on	other	verbs	with	a	similar	pattern.	But	what	
    you	can	also	do	is	look	at	the	words	that	are	formed	from	this	word	in	English,	or	
    even	in	Greek.	Often	we	find	that	we	form	other	vocabulary	on	the	closed	version.	
    So,	as	we	have	eclipse	…	what	do	you	think	the	closed	version	of	λείπω	might	be?		
	
S:	 Λείψω	[lípso].		
	
T:	 Λείψω.	So	how	would	you	say,	I	have	missed	you.	You	have	been	absent	to	me?		
	
S:	 Μου	έχεις	λείψει	[mu	échis	lípsi].		
	
T:	 Μου	έχεις	λείψει,	no?	You	have	absented	to	me.	We	have	missed	you?		
	
S:	 Μας	έχεις	λείψει	[mas	échis	lípsi].		
	
T:	 Μας	 έχεις	 λείψει.	 Very	 good.	 So	 with	 some	 verbs,	 you	 know,	 you	 will	 have	 a	
    “μου”	 [mu],	 where	 you	 might	 not	 expect	 it,	 in	 which	 case	 you	 can	 translate	 the	
    verb	in	a	way	that	helps	it	makes	sense,	no?	To	be	pleasing	to;	To	be	absent	to.		


                                                                                            267
	
	 “To	dance”	was,	χορεύω	[khorévo],	like	in	“choreography”.	Xορεύω.		
	
S:	 Xορεύω.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	He	likes	to	dance?		
	
S:	 Του	 αρέσει	 να	 χορέψει	 [tu	 arési	 na	 khorépsi].	 Or	 …	 Του	 αρέσει	 να	 χορεύει	 [tu	
    arési	na	khorévi]?		
	
T:	 Are	we	referring	to	an	open	concept	of	time,	or	a	closed	one?	A	specific	event?		
	
S:	 Yeah,	it’s	an	open.		
	
T:	 Very	 open.	 He	 likes	 to	 dance,	 generally,	 no?	 Του	 αρέσει	 να	 χορεύει.	 He	 misses	
    dancing.	 We	will	 say	 in	 the	 same	way,	It’s	 missing	 to	him.	 It’s	 absent	to	 him,	 να	
    [na],	he	dances.		
	
S:	 	Του	λείπει	να	χορεύει	[tu	lípi	na	khorévi].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Του	 λείπει	 να	 χορεύει.	 Again,	 it’s	 open,	 no?	 Του	 λείπει	 να	 χορεύει.	
    What	was,	I	write?	Like	“graphite”,	for	example.		
	
S:	 Γράφω	[ghráfo].		
	
T:	 Γράφω.	We	like	to	write.	It	pleases	us	to	write.		
	
S:	 Μας	αρέσει	να	γράφουμε	[mas	arési	na	gráfume].		
	
T:	 Μας	αρέσει	να	γράφουμε.	We	miss	writing?	We	miss	writing.		
	
S:	 Μας	λείπει	να	γράφουμε	[mas	lípi	na	gráfume].		
	
T:	 Μας	 λείπει	 να	 γράφουμε.	 Very	 good.	 Μας	 λείπει	 να	 γράφουμε.	 “To	 draw”,	 to	
    draw,	is	ζωγραφίζω	[zoghrafízo].		
	
S:	 Zωγραφίζω.		
	
T:	 This	 is	 like,	 “to	 life	 write”,	 no?	 Η	 ζωή,	 is	 “life”,	 like	 the	 …	 like	 the	 English	 name,	
    “Zoe”,	 like	 the	 word,	 “zoo”.	 Zωγραφίζω.	 Τo	 life	 write;	 To	 draw.	 How	 would	 you	
    say,	They	like	to	draw?		
	
S:	 Τους	αρέσει	να	ζωγραφίζουν	[tus	arési	na	zoghrafízun].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τους	αρέσει,	and	this	works	for	all	genders,	no,	because	it’s	“to	them”.	
    Τους	αρέσει	να	ζωγραφίζουν.	They	miss	drawing.		
	


                                                                                                      268
S:	 Τους	λείπει	να	ζωγραφίζουν	[tus	lípi	na	zoghrafízun].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τους	λείπει	να	ζωγραφίζουν.	So	I	said	that	“life”,	the	noun,	the	word	
    we	can	put	“the”	in	front	of	is,	η	ζωή,	“the	life”,	like	the	name,	“Zoe”.	We	could	
    also	have	“ζώο”	[zóo],	meaning	“animal”.	Ζώο.		
	
S:	 Ζώο.		
	
T:	 What	gender	is,	ζώο?		
	
S:	 Neuter.	
	
T:	 Neuter.	So	how	would	you	say,	animals?		
	
S:	 Τα	ζωατά	[ta	zoatá].		
	
T:	 Ζώο,	what	does	it	end	in?		
	
S:	 An	O	(ο).		
	
T:	 So	what	will	you	do	to	make	that	plural?		
	
S:	 Just	add	an	A	(α).		
	
T:	 Change	the	O	to	an	A,	no?		
	
S:	 Τα	ζώα	[ta	zóa].		
	
T:	 Τα	ζώα.	So	it	has	two	O’s,	no?	Ζώο	[zóo],	and	then	the	last	one	we	change	to	an	A	
    (α).	Ζώα,	τα	ζώα.	“Animals,	the	animals”.	We	like	to	draw	animals.	We	like	to	draw	
    animals.		
	
S:	 Μας	αρέσει	να	ζωγραφίζουμε	ζώα	[mas	arési	na	zografízume	zóa].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μας	 αρέσει	 να	 ζωγραφίζουμε	 ζώα.	 And	 whilst	 we’re	 here,	 what	 do	
    you	think	the	closed	version	of,	ζωγραφίζω,	might	be?		
	
S:	 Well	the	Z	(ζ)	usually	changes	to	S	(σ).	So,	ζωγραφίσω	[zoghrafíso].		
	
T:	 Zωγραφίσω,	correct.	But	the	Z	(“zee”),	the	“zed”	(Ζ/ζ)	doesn’t	always	change	to	an	
    S.	 We	 have,	 αλλάζω,	 αλλάξω	 [alázo,	 alákso],	 “I	 change”;	 παίζω,	 παίξω	 [pézo,	
    pékso],	“I	play”.	Very	good.

Teacher:	So,	I	like	it,	or,	It	is	pleasing	to	me,	is?		
	
Student:	Μου	αρέσει	[mu	arési].		
	
T:	 Μου	 αρέσει.	 I	 like	 it.	 It	 is	 pleasing	 to	 me,	 no?	 Aρέσει,	 “it	 is	 pleasing”;	 μου,	 “to	
    me”.	Μου	αρέσει.	“I	liked	it”,	I	liked	it,	is,	Μου	άρεσε	[mu	árese].	“It	was	pleasing	
    to	me”,	μου	άρεσε.	So	this	is	a	different	past	to	the	one	that	we’ve	seen,	no,	so	
    far,	 which	 is	 like,	 “I	 have	 …	 I	 have	 liked	 it”.	 We’ve	 seen	 how	 to	 go	 into	 the	 past	
    that	 way.	 And	 this	 is	 just,	 “I	 liked	 it”,	 the	 simple	 past,	 Μου	 άρεσε.	 So	 what	
    happens	to	get	this	past,	for	he,	she,	and	it?	Άρεσε	[árese].	What’s	the	first	thing	
    that	we	notice	about	“άρεσε”?		
	
S:	 So,	the	accent	shifts.		
	
T:	 So	 yes,	 the	 stress	 moves,	 no?	 We	 have,	 αρέσει	 [arési],	 and	 then	 άρεσε	 [árese].	
    Very	 good.	 So	 the	 stress	 on	 the	 word	 moves	 back	 in	 the	 past.	 And	 what	 else	 to	
    you	notice	between,	αρέσει,	and	άρεσε?		
	
S:	 Well,	the	ending	is	[e]	instead	of	[i].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	We	have	an	[e]	sound	on	the	end.	So	the	accent	moves	back	into	the	
    past.	 So	 actually,	 we	 are	 pulling	 the	 accent	 back	 into	 the	 past	 in	 Greek.	 And	
    languages	 often	 use	 accents	 in	 this	 way.	 For	 example,	 in	 Spanish,	 in	 the	 future	
    tenses,	 you	 push	 the	 accent	 forward,	 into	 the	 future.	 We	 also	 mentioned	 the	
    word	 “echo”,	 no?	 Being	 an	 echo	 of	 the	 word	 for	 sound.	 We	 had,	 ήχος	 [íkhos],	
    “sound”,	and	ηχώ	[ikhó],	“echo”.	So	word	stress	is	used	in	all	kinds	of	fascinating	
    ways	in	language,	generally,	and	not	least	in	Greek.	So,	an	important	example	of	
    this	is	in	the	past.	We	have,	Μου	αρέσει	[mu	arési],	“It	pleases	me”,	“I	like	it”,	and	
    then,	Μου	άρεσε	[mu	árese],	“It	pleased	me”,	“I	liked	it”.	So	this	is	the	past	for	he,	
    she,	and	it,	no,	this	[e]	sound.	It	pleased,	he	pleased,	she	pleased.	How	would	you	
    say,	You	liked	it.	You	liked	him.	You	liked	her.	It	was	pleasing	to	you?		
	
S:	 Σου	άρεσε	[su	árese].		
	
T:	 Σου	άρεσε.	Or	with	a	contraction,	no?	Σου	[su]	and,	άρεσε	[árese]	can	contract:	
    σ’	άρεσε”	[s’árese],	we	could	hear.	Did	you	like	it?		
	
S:	 Σ’	άρεσε;	[sárese?].		
	
T:	 Σ’	άρεσε;	Σου	άρεσε;	[su	árese?].	Didn’t	you	like	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	σ’	άρεσε;	[dhen	s’árese?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	σου	άρεσε;	[dhen	su	árese?].	Δεν	σ’	άρεσε;	I	didn’t	like	it.	It	didn’t	please	me.		
	


                                                                                                   270
S:	 Δεν	μ’	άρεσε	[dhen	m’árese].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 μ’	 άρεσε.	 Δεν	 μου	 άρεσε	 [dhen	 mu	 árese].	 What	 is,	 Ηe	 waits,	 She	 waits,	 It	
    waits?		
	
S:	 Περιμένει	[periméni].		
	
T:	 Περιμένει.	He	waited,	She	waited,	or	even,	It	waited?		
	
S:	 Περίμενε	[perímene].		
	
T:	 Περίμενε.	 Good.	 Περίμενε.	 So,	 we	 pulled	 the	 accent	 back.	 We	 have,	 περιμένει	
    [periméni];	we	pull	that	back,	περί	[perí],	and	we	have	the	[e]	ending	for	he,	she,	
    and	it.	Περίμενε,	περίμενε.	He	didn’t	wait.	She	didn’t	wait.	He	wasn’t	waiting.	She	
    wasn’t	waiting.		
	
S:	 Δεν	περίμενε	[dhen	perímene].		
	
T:	 Δεν	περίμενε.	He	didn’t	wait	for	me.		
	
S:	 Δεν	με	περίμενε	[dhen	me	perímene].		
	
T:	 Δεν	με	περίμενε.	He	didn’t	wait	for	you.	She	didn’t	wait	for	you.		
	
S:	 Δεν	σε	περίμενε	[dhen	se	perímene].		
	
T:	 Δεν	σε	περίμενε.	To	get	“you”	in	the	past,	so	to	say,	for	example,	“You	waited”,	to	
    this	[e]	sound,	we	add	an	S	(-ς).	So	we	have	the	[e]	for	he,	she,	and	it,	which	is	just	
    a	vowel,	just	like	in	the	present,	no?	Περιμένει,	περίμενε	[periméni,	perímene]	–	
    just	 a	 vowel	 for	 he/she/it.	 And	 then	 also	 like	 the	 present,	 we	 add	 an	 S	 (σ)	 for	
    “you”.	Περιμένεις,	περίμενες	[periménis,	perímenes].	So,	Did	you	wait?	Were	you	
    waiting?		
	
S:	 Περίμενες;	[perímenes?].		
	
T:	 Περίμενες;	Were	you	waiting	for	me?		
	
S:	 Με	περίμενες;	[me	perímenes?].		
	
T:	 Με	περίμενες;	Were	you	waiting	for	me	outside?		
	
S:	 Με	περίμενες	έξω;	[me	perímenes	ékso?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Με	περίμενες	έξω;	Were	you	waiting	for	him?		
	
S:	 	Τον	περίμενες;	[ton	perímenes?].		
	


                                                                                               271
T:	 Τον	περίμενες;	Weren’t	you	waiting	for	him?		
	
S:	 Δεν	τον	περίμενες;	[dhen	ton	perímenes?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	τον	περίμενες;	Weren’t	you	waiting	for	her?		
	
S:	 Δεν	την	περίμενες;	[dhen	tin	perímenes?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 την	 περίμενες;	 Weren’t	 you	 waiting	 for	 them?	 And	 it’s	 a	 feminine	 “them”.	
    Weren’t	you	waiting	for	them?	Females.		
	
S:	 Δεν	τις	περίμενες;	[dhen	tis	perímenes?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	τις	περίμενες;	And	masculine,	or	a	mixed	group?		
	
S:	 Δεν	τους	περίμενες;	[dhen	tus	perímenes?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 τους	 περίμενες;	 Very	 good.	 So	 “τους”	 works	 for	 masculine	 or	 mixed,	 when	
    we’re	 talking	 about	 people.	 When	 we’re	 talking	 about	 objects	 of	 mixed	 gender,	
    it’s	more	likely	to	use	the	neuter	plural.	So	this	is	“τα”	[ta]	like,	τα	πράγματα	[ta	
    prághmata],	“the	things”,	no,	if	we	are	talking	about	things	of	mixed	gender.	So,	if	
    you	were	to	say,	Weren’t	you	waiting	for	them?,	and	you	meant	objects	of	mixed	
    gender,	 you	 would	 use	 the	 neuter	 plural.	 So,	 how	 would	 that	 be:	 Weren’t	 you	
    waiting	for	them?		
	
S:	 Δεν	τα	περίμενες;	[dhen	ta	perímenes?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	τα	περίμενες;	Good.

Teacher:	How	would	you	say,	I’m	waiting	outside?		
	
Student:	Περιμένω	έξω	[periméno	ékso].		
	
T:	 Περιμένω	έξω.	I’m	waiting	outside.	Περιμένω	έξω.	And	this	can	also	be	like,	I	will	
    wait	outside,	with	context.	Ι	don’t	know,	maybe	you	are	heading	for	the	door;	you	
    can	just	say,	Περιμένω	έξω.	You	won’t	necessarily	need	to	say,	Θα	περιμένω	έξω

S:	 Περιμένει	έξω	[periméni	ékso].

T:	 Good.	 Περιμένει	 έξω	 από	 το	 σπίτι.	 And	 we	 could	 also	 have,	 άπ’	 το	 σπίτι	 [áp’to	
    spíti],	the	contraction	of	“από	το”	–	άπ’	το	σπίτι.		
	
	 “The	door”	is,	η	πόρτα	[i	pórta].	Η	πόρτα.

T:	 That’s,	P	(Π/π)	-	O	(Ο/ο)	-	R	(Ρ/ρ)	-	T	(Τ/τ)	-	A	(Α/α).	Η	πόρτα,	“the	door”.

S:	 Περιμένει	έξω	από	την	πόρτα	[periméni	ékso	apó	tin	pórta].		
	
T:	 Very	good	–	από	την	[apó	tin],	no,	because	it’s	from	“her”,	rather	than	from	“she”.	
    Περιμένει	έξω	από	την	πόρτα.	Περιμένει	έξω	άπ’	την	πόρτα	[periméni	ékso	áp’tin

T:	 Περίμενες,	περίμενες.	Good.	“Exit”	is	έξοδος	[éksodhos].	Έξοδος.		
	
S:	 Έξοδος.		
	
T:	 So	 we	 have	 “έξω”	 [ékso]	 for	 outside,	 and	 “έξοδος”	 [éksodhos]	 for	 exit.	 What	
    gender	does	έξοδος	look	like?		
	
S:	 Masculine.		
	
T:	 It	 certainly	 looks	 masculine,	 no,	 and	 -OS	 (-ος)	 nouns,	 nouns	 ending	 in	 “ος”,	
    generally	are	masculine,	but	actually	they	can	be	any	gender.	Έξοδος	is	feminine.	
    It’s,	η	έξοδος,	μία	έξοδος	[i	éksodhos,	mía	éksodhos].		
	
S:	 H	έξοδος.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	in	the	“she”	form,	no,	when	this	noun,	η	έξοδος,	“the	exit”,	is	behaving	
    like	 “she”.	 The	 “her”	 form,	 when	 it’s	 behaving	 like	 “her”	 is,	 την	 έξοδο	 [tin	
    éksodho].		
	
S:	 Την	έξοδο.		
	
T:	 So	you	treat	the	two	elements	separately.	This	OS	“ος”	noun	that	looks	masculine,	
    but	 is	 actually	 feminine,	 behaves	 masculine.	 It	 loses	 the	 S	 (ς)	 still,	 no?	 But	 the	
    word	for	“the”	(η	[i])	changes	to	την.	So	you	get,	την	έξοδο,	when	it	is	behaving	
    like	“her”.		
	
	 Were	you	waiting	at	the	exit?	“At	the	exit”,	or	“by	the	exit”,	is	just	“to	the	exit”	in	
    Greek.	So,	Were	you	waiting	at	the	exit?		
	
S:	 Περίμενες	 στον	 ...	 έξοδο;	 [perímenes	 ston	 éksodho?].	 Περίμενες	 στην	 έξοδο;	
    [perímenes	stin	éksodho?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Περίμενες	στην	έξοδο;	Good.		What	was	the	word	for,	with?		
	
S:	 Με	[me].		
	
T:	 Με.	The	same	as	me,	no,	με.	So,	He	was	waiting	at	the	exit	with	your	friend.	He	
    was	waiting	...		
	
S:	 Περίμενε	[perímene].		
	
T:	 ...	at	the	exit.		
	
S:	 ...	στην	έξοδο	[stin	éksodho].		
	
T:	 ...	στην	έξοδο.	With	your	friend,	with	a	male	friend.	With	your	friend.		
	


                                                                                                274
S:	 ...	με	τον	φίλο	σου	[me	ton	fílo	su].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Περίμενε	στην	έξοδο	με	τον	φίλο	σου	[perímene	stin	éksodho	me	ton	
    fílo	su].	Very	good.	So	we	have	these	E’s	(E/ε)	popping	up	in	the	past,	only	for	the	
    he/she/it	form	and	the	you	form.	Otherwise	we	have	an	A	(A/α)	popping	up	in	the	
    past.	So	an	A	by	itself,	counts	for	“I”.	Περίμενα	[perímena],	περίμενα	is	“I	waited”,	
    or,	“I	was	waiting”.		
	
S:	 Περίμενα.	
	
T:	 I	was	waiting	outside.		
	
S:	 Περίμενα	έξω	[perímena	ékso].		
	
T:	 Περίμενα	έξω.	I	was	waiting	at	the	exit.		
	
S:	 Περίμενα	στην	έξοδο	[perímena	stin	éksodho].		
	 	
T:	 Περίμενα	στην	έξοδο.		
	
	 If	you	want	to	get	“they”,	the	“they”	form	in	the	past,	you	can	add	our	consonant	
    sound	for	“they”	onto	[a].	So	what’s	our	consonant	sound	for	“they”?	What	pops	
    up	for	“they”?		
	
S:	 N.		
	
T:	 An	Ν.	So	how	would	we	say,	Τhey	were	waiting?		
	
S:	 Περίμενουν	[perímenun]	...	περίμεναν	[perímenan].		
	
T:	 Good,	περίμεναν	[perímenan].	So	we	have	the	A	popping	up	now	in	the	past,	and	
    we	just	add	an	Ν	(ν)	to	that:	περίμεναν.	But	we	could	also	add	an	E	(ε),	no,	like	we	
    see,	 for	 example,	 in	 the	 present.	 We	 have	 περιμένουν	 [periménun]	 and	
    περιμένουνε	[periménune].	We	have	that	option.	We	also	have	that	option	in	the	
    past.	So	if	you	were	to	add	an	E	(ε)	onto	this,	how	would	it	sound?		
	
S:	 Περιμένανε	[periménane].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Περιμένανε.	 And	 here	 the	 accent	 moves.	 We	 have	 περίμεναν	
    [perímenan],	no?	The	accent	moves	back	from	περιμένουν	–	περίμεναν.	Βut	when	
    we	have	two	syllables,	when	we’re	adding	two	syllables	on	the	end,	then	we	don’t	
    need	to	move	the	accent.	Actually	in	the	past	we	want	the	accent	third	from	the	
    end,	and	it’s	already	there	when	we	add	two	syllables.	So,	περίμεναν	[perímenan]	
    and	περιμένανε	[periménane].	Both	exist.	Both	are	correct.	So	if	you	forget	to	put	
    the	accent	back	when	you’re	building	it,	you	know,	you	can	just	kind	of	add	an	E	
    (ε)	on,	if	you	are	in	the	“they”	form,	no?	If	you	forget	to	go	περίμεναν,	and	you	go,	
    περιμένανε	–	Okay,	still	correct.	They	didn’t	wait	for	me.		


                                                                                     275
	
S:	 Δεν	με	περιμένανε	[dhen	me	periménane].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 με	 περιμένανε.	 Δεν	 με	 περίμεναν	 [dhen	 me	 perímenan].	 What	
    was,	the	exit?		
	
S:	 Η	έξοδος	[i	éksodhos].		
	
T:	 Η	έξοδος.	So	we	have	έξοδος,	which	ends	[os]	(-ος).	Looks	masculine	and	behaves	
    a	little	bit	masculine,	no,	dropping	its	S	(ς)	when	it’s	in	the	“her”	position,	no?	But	
    it’s	feminine:	Η	έξοδος.		
	
	 The	entrance	is,	η	είσοδος	[i	ísodhos].	So	again	ending	[os]	(-ος)	and	feminine.	The	
    entrance,	η	είσοδος.		
	
S:	 Η	είσοδος.		
	
T:	 Η	είσοδος.	So	a	nice	pair	these	two	–	έξοδος,	είσοδος	[éksodhos,	ísodhos]	–	tο	be	
    reminded	that	some	[os]	(-ος)	nouns	aren’t	masculine.	In	fact	it’s	often	places	that	
    break	the	norm	of	“-ος”	nouns	being	masculine.	We	have	“Cyprus”,	for	example	
    or,	“The	Cyprus”,	which	is,	Η	Κύπρος	[i	kípros],	feminine.	Or	even	“the	place”,	το	
    μέρος	 [to	 méros],	 no,	 “-ος”,	 but	 neuter	 –	 το	 μέρος.	 So	 we	 have	 είσοδος,	 η	
    είσοδος,	 μία	 είσοδος	 [mía	 ísodhos],	 “entrance”.	 They	 waited	 for	 me	 at	 the	
    entrance.		
	
S:	 Με	περίμεναν	στην	είσοδο	[me	perímenan	stin	ísodho].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Με	 περίμεναν,	 με	 περιμένανε,	 στην	 είσοδο	 [me	 perímenan,	 me	
    periménane,	stin	ísodho].		
	
	 I	didn’t	like	them.	They	didn’t	please	me.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	αρέσανε	[dhen	mu	arésane].		
	
T:	 Good.	Δεν	μου	αρέσανε.	Or	...	?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	άρεσαν	[dhen	mu	áresan].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μου	άρεσαν.	So	with	the	“they”	ending,	we	can	have	“-αν”	[-an]	or	
    “-ανε”	 [-ane],	 which	 means	 that	 we	 even	 need	 to	 pull	 our	 accent	 back	 into	 the	
    past,	 or	 we	 can	 leave	 it	 where	 it	 is,	 no,	 if	 we	 are	 adding	 “-ανε”:	 περιμένανε	
    [periménane],	περίμεναν	[perímenan].		
	
	 For	“we”,	for	the	“we”	ending	in	the	past,	we	have	“-αμε”	[ame].	So	again	we’re	
    using	 the	 A	 vowel	 (α),	 like	 in	 [a]	 for	 “I”,	 περίμενα	 [perímena],	 περίμεναν	
    [perímenan]	for	“they”,	and	now	“-αμε”	for	“we”,	which	is	always	two	syllables.	




                                                                                            276
   So	try	that.	Try	building	that	–	We	waited.	We’re	going	to	have	the	accent	third	
   from	the	end.		
	
S:	 Περιμέναμε	[periméname].		
	
T:	 Περιμέναμε.		
	
S:	 Περιμέναμε.		
	
T:	 And	what	is,	We	wait?		
	
S:	 Περιμένουμε	[periménume].		
	
T:	 Περιμένουμε.	So	here	actually,	the	accent’s	in	the	same	place,	in	the	present	and	
    in	 the	 past.	 Περιμένουμε,	 περιμέναμε	 [periménume,	 periméname].	 ’Cos	 we	 are	
    adding	two	syllables	with	“-αμε”	[ame],	περιμέναμε.	So	a	very	small	difference	for	
    “we”	in	the	past	and	present:	περιμένουμε,	περιμέναμε,	a	very	small	difference.	
    Just	 hearing	 that	 A	 and	 the	 context,	 will	 show	 you	 that	 it’s	 the	 past.	 We	 didn’t	
    wait.		
	
S:	 Δεν	περιμέναμε	[dhen	periméname].		
	
T:	 Δεν	περιμέναμε.	She	didn’t	like	us.	We	didn’t	please	her.	
	
S:	 Δεν	την	αρέσαμε	[dhen	tin	arésame].		
	
T:	 Δεν	την	αρέσαμε?	It’s	more	like,	We	weren’t	pleasing	to	her,	no,	actually.		
	
S:	 Δεν	της	αρέσαμε	[dhen	tis	arésame].		
	
T:	 Δεν	της	αρέσαμε.	She	doesn’t	like	us.	We	are	not	pleasing	to	her.		
	
S:	 Δεν	την	[dhen	tin]	...	Ah.	Δεν	της	αρέσουμε	[dhen	tis	arésume].		
	
T:	 Good.	Δεν	της	αρέσουμε.	So	again	a	very	small	difference	between,	She	didn’t	like	
    us	–	Δεν	της	αρέσαμε,	and	She	doesn’t	like	us	–	Δεν	της	αρέσουμε.	Very	good.

T:	 An	S,	the	sound	that	we	tend	to	associate	with,	You,	no?	So,	if	you	want	to	say,	
    She	liked	it.	It	was	pleasing	to	her.		
	
S:	 Της	άρεσε	[tis	árese].		
	
T:	 Της	άρεσε.	Νο?	To	her,	της	[tis],	της	άρεσε.	And,	She	liked	you,	You	pleased	her,	
    You	were	pleasing	to	her?		
	
S:	 Της	άρεσες	[tis	áreses].		
	
T:	 Της	άρεσες.	Good.	You	were	pleasing	to	her.	So	for,	he/she	and	it,	and	for	you,	we	
    have	[e]	(ε);	[e]	and	[es]	(ες):	άρεσε,	άρεσες	[árese,	áreses];	περίμενε,	περίμενες	
    [perímene,	perímenes].	Otherwise,	what	vowel	sound	do	we	have	in	the	past	for	
    everybody	else?		
	
S:	 [a]	(A/α).		
	
T:	 [a].	Good.	So,	I	waited,	I	was	waiting?		
	
S:	 Περίμενα	[perímena].		
	
T:	 Περίμενα.	They	waited?		
	
S:	 Περιμένανε	[periménane].		
	
T:	 Περιμένανε,	περίμεναν	[perímenan].	And,	We	waited,	We	were	waiting?		
	
S:	 Περιμέναμε	[periméname].		
	
T:	 Περιμέναμε.	Very	good.	
	
	 So,	 περιμέναμε,	 I’m	 saying	 is,	 We	 waited,	 or	 We	 were	 waiting.	 This	 is	 because	
    περιμένω	[periméno]	doesn’t	have	an	alternative,	closed	version.	But	if	the	verb	
    does,	then	you	have	the	choice	to	make.	We	can	get,	for	example,	I	was	buying,	
    using	our	standard,	open	verb	form	or,	I	bought,	using	our	closed	version.	What	
    was,	I	buy,	in	the	present?		
	
S:	 Αγοράζω	[aghorázo].		
	


                                                                                        278
T:	 Αγοράζω.	 I	 was	 buying.	 So	 we	 are	 going	 to	 stick	 with	 our	 standard	 verb	 form.	 I	
    was	buying?		
	
S:	 Αγόραζα	[aghóraza].		
	
T:	 Αγόραζα.	Good.	So	we	move	the	accent	back	and	we	change	the	O	(ω)	to	an	A	(α),	
    αγόραζα.	 And	 this	 gives	 us,	 with	 our	 normal,	 standard	 open	 verb	 form,	 I	 was	
    buying.	I	bought?	So	for,	I	bought,	we	will	use	the	closed	form	of	αγοράζω.		
	
S:	 Αγόρασα	[aghórasa].		
	
T:	 Αγόρασα.	Good,	with	an	S	(Σ/σ),	no?	Αγόρασα.	I	bought	it.		
	
S:	 Το	αγόρασα	[to	aghórasa].		
	
T:	 Το	αγόρασα,	if	we	mean	a	neuter	thing,	no?	I	bought	you	it.	I	bought	it	for	you.		
	
S:	 Στo	αγόρασα	[sto	aghórasa].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Στo	αγόρασα.	Σου	το	αγόρασα	[su	to	aghórasa].	We	bought	you	it.		
	
S:	 Σου	το	αγοράσαμε	[su	to	aghorásame].		
	
T:	 Σου	το	αγοράσαμε.	Στο	αγοράσαμε	[sto	aghorásame].	Very	good.	They	bought	us	
    it.	They	bought	it	for	us.		
	
S:	 Μας	το	αγοράσανε	[mas	to	aghorásane].		
	
T:	 Μας	το	αγοράσανε.	Mας	το	αγόρασαν	[mas	to	aghórasan].	Very	good.		
	
	 They	were	buying	it	for	us.	So	here	we	have	the	open	time.	We	are	talking	about,	
    you	know	–	they	were	in	the	act	of	buying	it	for	us,	and	then	whatever	happens,	
    you	know.	They	were	buying	it	for	us.		
	
S:	 Μας	το	αγοράζανε	[mas	to	aghorázane].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μας	το	αγοράζανε.	Mας	το	αγόραζαν	[mas	to	aghórazan].	She	bought	
    it.		
	
S:	 Το	αγόρασε	[to	aghórase].		
	
T:	 Το	αγόρασε.	Did	you	buy	it?		
	
S:	 Το	αγόρασες;	[to	aghórases?].		
	
T:	 Το	αγόρασες;	Where	did	you	buy	it?		
	


                                                                                             279
S:	 Πού	το	αγόρασες;	[pu	to	aghórases?].		
	
T:	 Πού	το	αγόρασες;	What	did	you	buy	there?		
	
S:	 Τι	αγόρασες	εκεί;	[ti	aghórases	ekí?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τι	αγόρασες	εκεί;	Did	you	buy	something	for	your	friend?	So,	Did	you	
    buy	something?		
	
S:	 Αγόρασες	κάτι;	[aghórases	káti].		
	
T:	 Αγόρασες	κάτι;	...	for	your	friend.	Let’s	have	a	female	friend.		
	
S:	 Για	την	φίλη	σου	[ya	tin	fíli	su].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αγόρασες	κάτι	για	την	φίλη	σου	[aghórases	káti	ya	tin	fíli	su?].		
	
	 The	word	for	“other”	or	“another”,	as	we’ve	seen,	is	άλλος,	άλλο,	άλλη,	[álos,	álo,	
    áli],	depending	on	the	gender.	The	word	“parallel”	in	English	is	built	on	άλλος,	no?	
    Something	like	“beside	one	another”.	So	άλλος	is	a	very	useful	little	word;	we	can	
    do	quite	a	lot	with	it.	You	can	use	it	like	“more”.	So,	for	example,	you	can	say,	you	
    know,	“Do	you	want	more	salad?”.	You	can	just	say	“Do	you	want	other	salad?”.	
    Θέλεις	άλλη	σαλάτα	[thélis	áli	saláta].	Νο?	Do	you	want	more	salad?	Or,	και	άλλη	
    [ke	áli],	“and	more”.	Θέλεις	και	άλλη	σαλάτα	[thélis	ke	áli	saláta],	you	could	say.	
	
	 Θελεις	[thélis],	you	can	also	contract	to	θες	[thes],	by	the	way.	You	will	hear	that	
    quite	often.	Θες	άλλη	σαλάτα;	[thes	áli	saláta?].	Θες	και	άλλη	σαλάτα;	[thes	ke	áli	
    saláta?].	How	would	you	say,	Do	you	want	more	coffee?		
	
S:	 Θες	και	άλλο	καφέ;	[thes	ke	álo	kafé?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θες	άλλο	καφέ;	[thes	álo	kafé?].	Θες	και	άλλο	καφέ;	Αnd	καφές,	which	
    here	 is	 behaving	 like	 “him”,	 rather	 than	 “he”,	 loses	 its	 S	 (ς).	 No?	 Θες	 και	 άλλο	
    καφέ;	 You	 could	 say,	 Θέλω	 καφέ	 με	 γάλα	 [thélo	 kafé	 me	 ghála]	 –	 “with	 milk”.	
    Γάλα	 [ghála]	 is	“milk”,	like	“galaxy”,	 the	 Milky	 Way.	So	I	 said	 that	 άλλος	 is	quite	
    useful;	we	can	use	it	for	quite	a	lot.		
	
	 How	was	the	word	for	when?		
	
S:	 Πότε	[póte].		
	
T:	 Πότε.	And	the	word	for	“then”,	as	in	time,	like,	you	know,	“by	then”;	very	similar	
    to	πότε.	You	can	even	think	of	it	as,	the	when,	kind	of	contracted.		
	
S:	 Τo	πότε	[to	póte]?		
	
T:	 Contracted.		


                                                                                               280
	
S:	 Τότε	[tóte].		
	
T:	 Τότε.	No?	So,	this	is	“then”,	as	in	time,	no,	maybe	actually	“the	when”,	something	
    like	“το	πότε”	contracted,	maybe.	And,	άλλοτε	[álote],	άλλοτε.	So,	joining	άλλος,	
    we	get	“another	time”,	άλλοτε.		
	
S:	 Άλλοτε,	άλλοτε.		
	
T:	 	What	was	the	word	for,	where?		
	
S:	 Πού	[pu].		
	
T:	 Πού.	 Άλλου	 [alú]	 means	 “another	 place”	 –	 so	 like	 “another	 where”,	 “another	
    place”	–	αλλού.		
	
S:	 Αλλού.	
	
T:	 We	have	the	word	for	“but”	also,	which	I	mentioned	–	one	word	for	“but”,	which	
    is	μα	[ma].	There	also	exists	αλλά	[alá],	αλλά.		
	
S:	 Αλλά.		
	
T:	 Which	 is	 like	 “otherly”,	 something	 like	 otherly,	 αλλά	 –	 but.	 So	 you	 can	 do	 a	 lot	
    with	άλλο	[álo],	no?	You	will	find	it	doing	a	lot	in	Greek.	And	of	course	we	have	
    the	verb,	αλλάζω	[alázo]	–	“I	change”.	Αλλάζω.		
	
S:	 Αλλάζω.		
	
T:	 Αλλάζω.	 Good.	 And	 this	 has	 the	 [zo]	 (-ζω)	 ending,	 no?	 Like	 we	 saw	 in	 αγορά	
    [aghorá],	 “market”,	 and	 αγοράζω	 [aghorázo],	 “I	 buy”;	 αρχή	 [archí],	 “beginning”,	
    and	αρχίζω	[archízo],	“I	start”.	The	closed	version	of,	αλλάζω	[alázo]	is?		
	
S:	 Αλλάξω	[alákso].		
	
T:	 Αλλάξω.	Very	good.	So,	not	like	αγοράζω	[aghorázo]	and	αρχίζω	[archízo],	which	
    go	 to	 S	 (σ),	 no?	 Αγοράσω,	 αρχίσω	 [aghoráso,	 archíso].	 Here	 we	 have	 αλλάζω	
    [alázo]	 to	 αλλάξω	 [alákso],	 like	πaίζω/πaίξω	 [pézo/pékso]	–	“I	 play”.	 How	 would	
    you	say,	He	changed,	She	changed?		
	
S:	 Άλλαξε	[álakse].		
	
T:	 Άλλαξε.	You	changed.		
	
S:	 Άλλαξες	[álakses].		
	
T:	 Άλλαξες.	You	have	changed.		


                                                                                               281
	
S:	 Έχεις	αλλάξει	[échis	aláksi].		
	
T:	 Έχεις	αλλάξει.	Good.		
	
	 “The	music”	is,	η	μουσική	[i	musikí].		
	
S:	 Η	μουσική.		
	
T:	 Η	μουσική;	like	“muse”,	“musings”,	no?	This	is	all	connected.	Your	music	is	your	
    muse,	or	your	musings.	Do	you	like	the	music?		
	
S:	 Σου	αρέσει	η	μουσική;	[su	arési	i	musikí?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Σου	αρέσει	η	μουσική;	Σ’	αρεσει	η	μουσικη;	[s’arési	i	musikí?].	Do	you	
    like	the	music,	or	shall	we	change	it?	The	word	for	“or”	in	Greek	is,	ή	[i].		
	
S:	 Ή.		
	
T:	 This	 is	 spelt	 like	 the	 feminine	 “η”	 [i]	 that	 we	 have	 for	 “the”	 in	 the	 feminine	
    endings,	with	the	“n”	shape	that	goes	below	the	line.	But	it	also	carries	a	written	
    accent,	to	differentiate	it	from	that	“η”	[i]	which	means	“the”,	no?	Otherwise,	in	
    some	written	sentences	we	could	have	confusion.	So,	ή	[i]	for	“or”,	the	[i]	sound	
    that	looks	like	an	“n”	with	the	tail	going	below	the	line,	with	an	accent	on	the	top.	
    So,	Do	you	like	the	music,	or	shall	we	change	it?		
	
S:	 Σου	αρέσει	η	μουσική	ή	να	την	αλλάζουμε	...	να	την	αλλάξουμε;	[su	arési	i	musikí	i	
    na	tin	alázume	…	na	tin	aláksume?].		
	
T:	 Σου	αρέσει	η	μουσική	ή	να	την	αλλάξουμε;	[su	arési	i	musikí	i	na	tin	aláksume?].	
    Shall	we	change	it	–	ή	να	την	αλλάξουμε.	So	the	“η”	[i]	of	the	music	and	the	“ή”	of	
    or,	is	the	same	letter,	but	“or”	has	a	written	accent	over	it.	Σου	αρέσει	η	μουσική	
    ή	 να	 την	 αλλάξουμε;	 I	 changed	 the	 music	 because	 I	 don’t	 like	 it.	 I	 changed	 the	
    music	because	I	don’t	like	it.		
	
S:	 Άλλαξα	την	μουσική	γιατί	δεν	μου	άρεσε	[álaksa	tin	musikí	yatí	dhen	mu	árese].		
	
T:	 Because	I	don’t	like	it.	You	said,	Because	I	didn’t	like	it;	that’s	fine,	or	so.	Άλλαξα	
    την	 μουσική	 γιατί	 (επειδή,	 διότι	 [epidhí,	 dhióti],	 you	 could	 also	 have	 for	
    “because”)	δεν	μου	άρεσε,	or,	δεν	μου	αρέσει	[dhen	mu	arési]	–	I	didn’t	like	it,	I	
    don’t	like	it.	Both	fit	there.		
	
    	                                 	




                                                                                             282
Complete	Greek,	Track	63	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	So	we’ve	seen	how,	in	the	simple	past,	no,	we	have	two	changes.	We	have	E	
    (ε)	or	an	A	(α)	ending,	with	our	different	additional	endings	for	people,	like	an	N	
    (ν),	which	corresponds	to	“they”,	or	the	ME	(με)	for	“we”,	or	the	S	(ς)	for	“you”;	
    and	the	accent	–	the	accent,	the	stress	on	the	word,	going	back	into	the	past.	We	
    want	it	third	from	the	end,	in	the	past.		
	
	 “The	clothes”,	the	clothes,	in	Greek	is,	τα	ρούχα	[ta	rúkha],	τα	ρούχα.		
	
Student:	Τα	ρούχα.		
	
T:	 So,	like	in	English,	no,	“clothes”,	it’s	plural	in	Greek,	τα	ρούχα.	What	gender	is,	τα	
    ρούχα?		
	
S:	 Neuter.		
	
T:	 Neuter.	Neuter.	No?	Neuter	plural.	So,	My	clothes?		
	
S:	 Τα	ρούχα	μου	[ta	rúkha	mu].		
	
T:	 Τα	ρούχα	μου.	What	was,	I	change?		
	
S:	 Αλλάζω	[alázo].		
	
T:	 	Αλλάζω.	I	am	changing	my	clothes.		
	
S:	 Αλλάζω	τα	ρούχα	μου	[alázo	ta	rúkha	mu].		
	
T:	 Αλλάζω	τα	ρούχα	μου.	I	was	changing	my	clothes.		
	
S:	 Άλλαζα	τα	ρούχα	μου	[álaza	ta	rúkha	mu].		
	
T:	 Άλλαζα	τα	ρούχα	μου.	She	was	changing	her	clothes.		
	
S:	 Άλλαζε	τα	ρούχα	της	[álaze	ta	rúkha	tis].		
	
T:	 Άλλαζε	τα	ρούχα	της.	Very	good.		
	
	 “Money”	is,	λεφτά	[leftá].	Λεφτά.		
	
S:	 Λεφτά.		
	
T:	 And	“the	money”	is,	τα	λεφτά	[ta	leftá],	so	λεφτά	isn’t	feminine	as	you	might	have	
    thought.	It’s	neuter	plural,	like,	ρούχα	[rúkha],	τα	λεφτά.		
	
S:	 Τα	λεφτά.		


                                                                                      283
	
T:	 She	was	changing	her	money.		
	
S:	 Άλλαζε	τα	λεφτά	της	[álaze	ta	leftá	tis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Άλλαζε	τα	λεφτά	της.	And,	She	changed	her	money?		
	
S:	 Άλλαξε	τα	λεφτά	της	[álakse	ta	leftá	tis].		
	
T:	 Άλλαξε	τα	λεφτά	της.	So	we	are	pulling	the	accent	back	into	the	past,	no?	But	if	
    the	ending	has	two	syllables,	well	then	the	accent	can	stay	put.	So	if	we	want	to	
    say,	We	changed?		
	
S:	 Αλλάξαμε	[aláksame].		
	
T:	 Αλλάξαμε.	We	changed	our	clothes.		
	
S:	 Αλλάξαμε	τα	ρούχα	μας	[aláksame	ta	rúkha	mas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αλλάξαμε	τα	ρούχα	μας.	And,	They	changed	their	clothes?		
	
S:	 Αλλάξανε	τα	ρούχα	τους	[aláksane	ta	rúkha	tus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αλλάξανε	τα	ρούχα	τους.	And	apart	from,	aλλάξανε,	what	else	could	
    we	have?		
	
S:	 Άλλαξαν	[álaksan].		
	
T:	 Άλλαξαν.	No?	So	if	we	add	just	one	syllable,	an	N	(ν),	for	our	ending,	we	must	put	
    the	accent	back.	Άλλαξαν.	Άλλαξαν	τα	ρούχα	τους	[álaksan	ta	rúkha	tus].		
	
	 What	was,	I	give?		
	
S:	 Δίνω	[dhíno].		
	
T:	 Δίνω.	 So	 δίνω	 has	 only	 two	 syllables,	 no?	 Δίνω	 [dhí-no].	 So	 how	 do	 we	 pull	 the	
    accent	back	from	δίνω?	“I	was	giving”	is,	έδινα	[édhina].	Έδινα.		
	
S:	 Έδινα.		
	
T:	 So	this	accent	change,	for	the	past	in	Greek,	is	so	important	that,	if	we	don’t	have	
    anywhere	to	put	the	accent,	if	we	don’t	have	anywhere	to	pull	it	back	and	put	it,	
    we	 will	 add	 a	 syllable,	 so	 we	 have	 somewhere	 to	 put	 it:	 έδινα	 [édhina].	 So	 we	
    added	an	[e]	(ε)	to	the	beginning,	just	so	we	have	somewhere	to	put	the	accent.	
    Έδινα.		
	
S:	 Έδινα.		


                                                                                             284
	
T:	 You	were	giving.		
	
S:	 Έδινες	[édhines].		
	
T:	 Έδινες.	We	were	giving.		
	
S:	 Δίναμε	[dhíname].		
	
T:	 Δίναμε.	So	here	we	don’t	need	to	add	any	syllable	at	the	beginning	for	the	accent,	
    because	 we	 are	 already	 adding	 two	 with	 “αμε”	 [ame].	 Δίναμε.	 Very	 good.	 They	
    were	giving.		
	
S:	 Δίνανε	[dhínane].	
	
T:	 Δίνανε.	But	what	if	we	were	to	just	use	AN	(αν)	[an]	for	“they”?		
	
S:	 Έδιναν	[édhinan].		
	
T:	 No?	 So	 we	 have	 two	 forms,	 which	 look	 quite	 different.	 Έδιναν	 [édhinan]	 and	
    δίνανε	[dhínane],	and	both	are	correct.	So	this	is,	I	was	giving,	They	were	giving,	
    We	were	giving.	What	is	the	closed	version	of	δίνω	[dhíno]?		
	
S:	 Δώσω	[dhóso].		
	
T:	 Δώσω.	So	how	do	you	think	you	would	say,	I	gave,	using	δώσω?		
	
S:	 Έδωσα	[édhosa].		
	
T:	 Έδωσα.	Good.	The	word	for	“already”	was	ήδη	[ídhi].		
	
S:	 Ήδη.		
	
T:	 Ήδη.	I	gave	you	it	already.		
	
S:	 Σου	το	έδωσα	ήδη	[su	to	édhosa	ídhi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Σου	το	έδωσα	ήδη.	Στο	έδωσα	ήδη	[sto	édhosa	ídhi].	What	if	we	were

T:	 Κάνω.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	I	did,	I	did,	you	need	to	change	the	O	(ω)	ending	to	...		
	
S:	 [a]	(α).		
	
T:	 	A/α	[a].	What	else	do	you	need	to	do?		
	
S:	 Pull	the	stress	back	into	the	past.		
	
T:	 Good.	But	can	you,	with	κάνω?	I	did	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έκανα	[to	ékana].	Το	έκανα.		
	
T:	 Το	έκανα.	He	did	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έκανε	[to	ékane].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	έκανε.	You	did	it.	Did	you	do	it?		
	
S:	 Το	έκανες;	[to	ékanes?].		
	
T:	 Το	έκανες;	We	did	it.		
	
S:	 Το	κάναμε	[to	káname].		
	
T:	 Το	κάναμε.	No?	Here	we	don’t	need	any	extra	syllable.	Το	κάναμε.	And,	They	did	
    it?		
	
S:	 Το	κάνανε	[to	kánane].		
	
T:	 Το	κάνανε	...	or?		
	
S:	 Το	έκαναν	[to	ékanan].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	έκαναν.		
	
	 We	 saw	 the	 verb,	 “I	 am	 missing”,	 used	 in	 like,	 “I	 miss	 you”.	 And	 also	 related	 to	
    “eclipse”	in	English.		
	
S:	 Λείπω	[lípo].		
	
T:	 Λείπω.	Good.	“I	am	missing”	–	λείπω.	And,	I	miss	you.	So,	You	are	missing	to	me?		
	
S:	 Μου	λείπεις	[mu	lípis].		
	
T:	 Μου	λείπεις.	And	the	closed	version	of	λείπω	[lípo]	is	...	?		
	


                                                                                              286
S:	 Λείψω	[lípso].		
	
T:	 Λείψω,	like	in	“eclipse”.	I	missed	you.	You	were	absent	to	me.		
	
S:	 Μου	έλειψες	[mu	élipses].		
	
T:	 Μου	έλειψες.	I	missed	you.	Did	you	miss	me?		
	
S:	 Με	έλειψες;	[me	élipses?].		
	
T:	 That	means,	“Did	I	miss	you?”	Did	you	miss	me?		
	
S:	 Σου	έλειψα;	[su	élipsa?].		
	
T:	 Σου	έλειψα;	Was	I	missing	to	you?	Σου	έλειψα;	No?	And	of	course	it	depends	on	
    context;	maybe	we	want	to	use	the	open	form	as	well	–	Σου	έλειπα;	[su	élipa?].	
    Were	you	missing	me?	Σου	έλειπα;		
	
	 Most	of	the	days	of	the	week,	in	Greek,	sound	like	the	numbers	corresponding	to	
    them.	So	for	example,	we	have	δύο	[dhío],	which	means	“two”,	and	then	Δευτέρα	
    [dheftéra],	 which	 is	 “Monday”,	 the	 second	 day,	 because	 the	 week	 starts	 on	
    Sunday.		
	
S:	 Δευτέρα.		
	
T:	 Δευτέρα.	We	have	“five”,	πέντε	[pénde],	and	then	“Thursday”,	Πέμπτη	[pémpti].		
	
S:	 Πέμπτη.		
	
T:	 And	 the	 names	 of	 the	 week	 are	 feminine,	 so	 we	 have,	 Η	 Πέμπτη	 [i	 pémpti]	 for	
    “Thursday”,	the	Thursday.	Η	Δευτέρα	for	“Monday”,	the	Monday.	They	will	do	it	
    on	Thursday?	So	for,	on	Thursday,	we’re	just	going	to	say,	“the	Thursday”.	“They	
    will	do	it	the	Thursday”,	we	will	say	in	Greek.	They	 will	do	it	the	Thursday.	They	
    will	do	it	on	Thursday.		
	
S:	 Θα	το	κάνουν	την	Πέμπτη	[tha	to	kánun	tin	pémpti].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θα	 το	 κάνουν	 την	 Πέμπτη.	 No?	 So,	 Η	 Πέμπτη	 [i	 pémpti]	 is	 behaving	
    like	“her”,	no?	It’s	on	Thursday:	“on	her”,	rather	than	“on	she”.	Θα	το	κάνουν	την	
    Πέμπτη.	They	did	it	on	Thursday.		
	
S:	 Το	κάνaνε	την	Πέμπτη	[to	kánane	tin	pémpti].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	κάνaνε	(το	έκαναν	[to	ékanan]),	την	Πέμπτη.	Very	good.

Teacher:	“I	play”,	I	play,	was	παίζω	[pézo],	probably	related	to,	παιδί	[pedhí],	no,	the	
    word	for	“child”,	as	the	[e]	sound	in	παίζω	and	παιδί	is	both	written	like	AI	(αι).	So	
    they	may	be	related.	Παίζω	[pézo]	–	I	play.		
	
Student:	Παίζω.		
	
T:	 He	plays,	or,	She	plays.		
	
S:	 Παίζει	[pézi].		
	
T:	 Παίζει.	How	would	you	say,	He	was	playing	/	She	was	playing?		
	
S:	 Έπαιζε	[épeze].		
	
T:	 Έπαιζε.	 Very	 good.	 We	 add	 an	 E	 (ε)	 on	 the	 beginning,	 no,	 to	 be	 able	 to	 pull	 the	
    accent	 back,	 and	 we	 also	 have	 an	 E	 (ε)	 on	 the	 end,	 which	 is	 for	 he/she	 and	 it.	
    Έπαιζε.	She	was	just	playing;	She	was	only	playing.		
	
S:	 Μόνο	έπαιζε	[móno	épeze].		
	
T:	 	Μόνο	έπαιζε.	Έπαιζε	μόνο	[épeze	móno].	Good.	She	was	just	playing	by	herself.		
	
S:	 Μόνο	έπαιζε	μόνη	της	[móno	épeze	móni	tis].		
	
T:	 Good.	Μόνο	έπαιζε	μόνη	της.	Good.	She	was	playing	with	her	friend.	Let’s	say	a	
    masculine	friend.	She	was	playing	with	her	friend.		
	
S:	 Έπαιζε	με	τoν	φίλo	της	[épeze	me	ton	fílo	tis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έπαιζε	με	τoν	φίλo	της.	Were	you	playing?		
	
S:	 Έπαιζες;	[épezes?].		
	
T:	 Έπαιζες;	Very	good.	Did	you	play?	So	not,	Were	you	playing?,	but,	Did	you	play?	
    So,	what	is	the	closed	version	of	παίζω	[pézo]?		
	
S:	 Παίξω	[pékso].		
	
T:	 Παίξω.	Good.	So,	Did	you	play?		
	
S:	 Έπαιξες;	[épekses?].		
	
T:	 Έπαιξες;	Very	good.	Did	they	play?		
	
S:	 Παίξανε;	[péksane?].		


                                                                                                288
	
T:	 Παίξανε;	Good,	or	...	?		
	
S:	 Έπαιξαν;	[épeksan?].		
	
T:	 Έπαιξαν;	So	we	have	a	big	difference	there,	no,	between	παίξανε	[péksane]	and	
    έπαιξαν	[épeksan].	But	they	both	mean	the	same.	Have	they	played?		
	
S:	 Έχουνε	παίζει;	[ékhune	pézi?].		
	
T:	 	Παίζει	[pézi]?		
	
S:	 Έχουνε	παίξει;	[ékhune	péksi?].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	to	form	this	“have”	past,	we	always	use	the	closed	version	of	the	verb,	
    no?	Έχουνε/έχουν	παίξει;	[ékhune/ékhun	péksi?].	Good.		
	
	 So	these	are	three	principal	ways	of	talking	about	the	past.	“I	was	playing”,	έπαιζα	
    [épeza];	“I	played”,	έπαιξα	[épeksa];	“I	have	played”,	έχω	παίξει	[ékho	péksi].	Just	
    like	in	English.		
	
	 I	do.	What	is,	I	do,	or,	I	make?		
	
S:	 Κάνω	[káno].		
	
T:	 Κάνω.	I	did	it.	I	was	doing	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έκανα	[to	ékana].		
	
T:	 Το	έκανα.	So	this	is,	I	did	it,	or,	I	was	doing	it,	because	we	have	no	closed	version	
    for	κάνω	[káno],	so	it’s	the	same.	Έκανα.	I	have	done	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έχω	κάνει	[to	ékho	káni].		
	
T:	 Το	έχω	κάνει.	Good.	You	did,	you	did	it?		
	
S:	 Το	έκανες	[to	ékanes].		
	
T:	 Το	έκανες.	Good.	What	did	you	do?		
	
S:	 Τι	έκανες;	[ti	ékanes?].		
	
T:	 Τι	εκανες;		
	
	 What	was	the	word	for	well,	like,	“I’m	well”.		
	
S:	 Καλά	[kalá].		


                                                                                     289
	
T:	 Καλά.	How	would	you	say,	Well	you	did?	Bear	with	me.		
	
S:	 Έκανες	καλά	[ékanes	kalá].		
	
T:	 So,	Well	you	did?		
	
S:	 Καλά	έκανες	[kalá	ékanes].		
	
T:	 Καλά	 έκανες.	 And	 this	 is	 an	 expression	 in	 Greek,	 like,	 “Well	 done”.	 No?	 Καλά	
    έκανες.	Well	you	did.	Καλά	έκανες	–	Well	done.		
	
	 So,	remind	me,	what	was,	It	is	necessary?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	[prépi	na].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει,	πρέπει	να.	Good.	How	would	we	say,	Ιt	was	necessary?		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	[éprepe].		
	
T:	 Έπρεπε.	Good.	Έπρεπε.	So,	έπρεπε,	we	can	use	to	say	things	like,	“I	had	to	buy	it”.	
    Ιt	was	necessary,	να	[na],	I	buy	it.	It	was	necessary	to	buy	it.	So,	how	would	that	
    be?		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	το	αγοράζω	[éprepe	na	to	aghorázo].		
	
T:	 Good.	I	like	how	you	didn’t	go	into	the	past	again.	That	was	correct,	no?	Because	
    it’s,	It	was	necessary,	να,	Ι	buy	it,	or,	It	was	necessary	to	buy	it;	so	we	don’t	go	into	
    the	 past	 again.	 But	 we	 …	 we	 have	 the	 verb	 after	 “να”,	 so	 we	 definitely	 need	 to	
    decide	if	we	want	the	closed	or	the	open	form.	So,	I	had	to	buy	it:	we	could	have	
    either,	 really	 depending	 on	 the	 context.	 Έπρεπε	 να	 το	 αγοράζω	 –	 this	 maybe	
    means	like	over	a	long	period,	you	know,	it	was	necessary	that	I	buy	it;	but	most	
    common	would	be	...	?		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	το	αγοράσω	[éprepe	na	to	aghoráso].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Έπρεπε	 να	 το	 αγοράσω.	 So,	 we	 don’t	 put	 both	 in	 the	 past,	 no?	 It	 was	
    necessary,	να,	I	buy	it.		
	
	 I	mentioned	the	word	for	“perfect”	before,	τέλειο	[télio].	Τέλειο.		
	
S:	 Τέλειο.		
	
T:	 	And,	τελειώνω	[telióno],	“I	finish”.	Τελειώνω.		
	
S:	 Τελειώνω.		
	


                                                                                              290
T:	 I	had	to	finish	it.	What	is	the	closed	version	of	τελειώνω?		
	
S:	 Τελειώσω	[telióso].		
	
T:	 Τελειώσω.	Very	good.	N	(ν)	to	S	(σ)	there.	Τελειώσω.	I	had	to	finish	it.		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	το	τελειώσω	[éprepe	na	to	telióso].		
	
T:	 Έπρεπε	να	το	τελειώσω.	Very	good.	I	was	waiting	for	it	to	finish.	So,	I	was	waiting,	
    is	the	first	bit.		
	
S:	 Περίμενα	[perímena],	περίμενα.		
	
T:	 Περίμενα.	Good.	For	it	to	finish.	So,	Περίμενα	να	...	?		
	
S:	 Να	τελειώσει	[na	teliósi].		
	
T:	 Να	τελειώσει.	Good.	So	again,	we	just	have	to	think	about	whether	we	want	the	
    open	or	the	closed	form.	We	don’t	go	into	the	past	again.	Περίμενα	[perímena],	I	
    was	waiting,	for	it	to	finish,	να	τελειώσει	[na	teliósi].	Or	we	could	also	say,	για	να	
    τελειώσει	 [ya	 na	 teliósi].	 Περίμενα	 για	 να	 τελειώσει	 [perímena	 ya	 na	 teliósi].	
    Περίμενα	 να	 τελειώσει	 [perímena	 na	 teliósi].	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 was	 waiting	
    for	him	(or	her)	to	finish	it?		
	
S:	 Περίμενα	…	περίμενα	να	το	τελειώσει	[perímena	…	perímena	na	to	teliósi].		
	
T:	 Περίμενα	 να	 το	 τελειώσει.	 Very	 good.	 I	 was	 waiting	 for	 him	 (or	 her)	 to	 finish	 it.	
    And	you	could	also	say,	to	clarify,	Τον	περίμενα	να	το	τελειώσει	[ton	perímena	na	
    to	teliósi],	I	was	waiting	for	him	to	finish	it.	Or,	Την	περίμενα	να	το	τελειώσει	[tin	
    perímena	na	to	teliósi].	So	you	could	say	that	as	well.		
	
	 If	we	say,	Πρέπει	να	[prépi	na],	it	finished.	So,	πρέπει	[prépi]	in	the	present,	and	
    the	verb,	the	following	verb,	in	the	past,	then	we	get	a	very	different	meaning.	We	
    get,	 “It	 must	 have	 finished”.	 It	 must	 have	 finished.	 So	 if	 you	 say,	 Πρέπει	 να,	 it	
    finished,	in	the	past,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τελείωσε	[prépi	na	telíose].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τελείωσε.	Good.	So	this	would	be,	It	must	have	finished.	It	must	have	
    been	finishing,	giving	an	open	feeling.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	τελείωνε	[prépi	na	telíone].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	τελείωνε.	Very	good.	What	was,	I	change?		
	
S:	 Αλλάζω	[alázo].

T:	 Αλλάζω.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Αλλάξω	[alákso].		
	
T:	 Αλλάξω.	They	have	to	change	it.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	το	αλλάξουνε	[prépi	na	to	aláksune].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	το	αλλάξουν	[prépi	na	to	aláksun].	Πρέπει	να	το	αλλάξουνε.	They	had	
    to	change	it.	It	was	necessary	to	change	it.		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	το	αλλάξουνε	[éprepe	na	to	aláksune].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Έπρεπε	 να	 το	 αλλάξουν	 [éprepe	 na	 to	 aláksun].	 Έπρεπε	 να	 το	
    αλλάξουνε.	They	must	have	changed	it.	So	for,	They	must	have	changed	it,	we	will	
    say,	Πρέπει	[prépi]	in	the	present,	and	then,	they	changed	it,	in	the	past.	So,	They	
    must	have	changed	it.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	το	αλλάξουν	…	άλλαξουν	[prépi	na	to	aláksun	…	álaksun]?	Πρέπει	να	το

T:	 Good.	Πρέπει	να	το	άλλαξαν	[prépi	na	to	álaksan].	Πρέπει	να	το	αλλάξανε	[prépi	
    na	to	aláksane].	So	with,	πρέπει,	in	the	present,	and	then	the	following	verb	in	the

Teacher:	Now	that	we	have	the	past,	now	that	we	dominate	the	past	in	Greek,	we	
    can	also	do	something	really	cool	with	things	that	we	already	know.	We	can	make	
    the	“would”	time	in	Greek	–	to	say,	for	example,	“I	would	change	it”.	No?	First	we	
    need	to	build,	I	was	changing	it.	So	how’s	that?		
	
Student:	Το	άλλαζα	[to	álaza].		
	
T:	 Το	άλλαζα.	Good.	So	we	have	our	open	standard	form	of	the	verb,	no,	for	“I	was	
    changing”.	Το	άλλαζα.	I	was	changing	it.	And	then,	we	add	“θα”	[tha]	to	this.	So	
    how	would	that	sound,	if	you	added	“θα”	to	that?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	άλλαζα	[tha	to	álaza].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	άλλαζα.	And	this	gives	us,	“I	would	change	it”.	So	we	just	use	the	open	past,	
    the	“-ing”,	the	ongoing	past,	no,	with	“θα”,	and	we	get	“would”.	I	would	change	it.	
    Θα	το	άλλαζα.	I	wouldn’t	change	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	το	άλλαζα	[dhen	tha	to	álaza].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θα	το	άλλαζα.	I	won’t,	I	will	not	change	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	το	αλλάξω	[dhen	tha	to	alákso].		
	
T:	 	Δεν	θα	το	αλλάξω.	Good.	So	this	is	actually	very	interesting,	the	fact	that	we	build	
    this	 time,	 just	 adding	 elements	 that	 already	 exist.	 And	 the	 fact	 that	 many	 other	
    languages	 do	 the	 same	 thing,	 such	 as	 Arabic,	 for	 example,	 suggests	 that	 the	
    “would”	time	came	much	later	in	language,	which	would	make	sense.	Of	course	
    we	didn’t	begin	our	language	journey	talking	about	hypothetical	“would”s,	no,	but	
    more	 concrete	 things.	 So	 we	 achieve	 the	 meaning	 of	 “would”,	 combining	 pre-
    existing	 elements	 of	 the	 language	 structure,	 no,	 and	 in	 this	 way	 get	 a	 new	
    meaning	to	express	something	new:	combining	“θα”	[tha]	with	the	open,	ongoing	
    past.		
	
	 How	would	you	say,	I	am	buying	it,	and	the	“it”	is	a	feminine	thing.

    course,	we	don’t	have	an	alternative	version	for,	κάνω.	So,	I	was	doing	it;	I	did	it.		
	
S:	 Έκανα	[ékana].		
	
T:	 Έκανα.	Or	with	the	“it”?		
	
S:	 Το	έκανα	[to	ékana].		
	
T:	 Το	έκανα.	I	would	do	it.		
	
S:	 Θα	το	έκανα	[tha	to	ékana].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	έκανα.	I	wouldn’t	do	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	το	έκανα	[dhen	tha	to	ékana].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θα	το	έκανα.	You	did	it,	or,	(You)	were	doing	it.		
	
S:	 Το	έκανες	[to	ékanes].		
	
T:	 Το	έκανες.	Would	you	do	it?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	έκανες;	[tha	to	ékanes?].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	έκανες;	What	if	we	were	to	stress	the	word	for	“you”?	Would	you	do	it?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	θα	το	έκανες;	[esí	tha	to	ékanes?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Εσύ	θα	το	έκανες;	Θα	το	έκανες	εσύ	[tha	to	ékanes	esí?].		
	
	 So	we	said	that	“θα”	[tha]	was	coming	from	θέλεινα	[thélina],	no?	We	mentioned	
    this	 when	 we	 looked	 at	 how	 the	 future	 in	 Greek,	 and	 in	 English,	 is	 coming	 from	
    the	 word	 “want”,	 no?	 “I	 will”	 is	 from	 German	 “Ich	 will”,	 no	 –	 “I	 want”;	 and	 θα	
    from	θέλεινα,	the	contraction	of	θέλεινα.	Even	in	Swahili	(which	I	can	now	say,	as	
    we	 have	 a	 Swahili	 course),	 Swahili	 does	 the	 same	 thing	 –	 builds	 the	 future	 with	
    this	idea	of	wanting.	So,	many	languages	do	that.		
	




                                                                                                 294
	 So,	Θα	το	αγόραζα	[tha	to	aghóraza],	is	something	like	“It	wants,	I	was	buying	it”.	
    And	with	this	we	get,	“I	would	buy	it”;	but	also	“I	was	going	to	buy	it”,	in	the	sense	
    of,	“I	meant	to	buy	it”,	which	is	closer	to	the	meaning	of	“want”,	no?	“I	was	going	
    to”	is,	“I	had	the	intention	to	–	the	will	to”.	So	we	also	get	that	meaning	with	this	
    same	structure.		
	
	 What	is,	I	work?		
	
S:	 Δουλεύω	[dhulévo].		
	
T:	 Δουλεύω.	I	was	working.		
	
S:	 Δούλευα	[dhúleva].		
	
T:	 Δούλευα.	I	was	going	to	work.		
	
S:	 Θα	δούλευα	[tha	dhúleva].		
	
T:	 Θα	δούλευα.	So	this	doesn’t	mean,	“I	was	going	on	my	way	to	…”,	no?	It	means,	I	
    had	 the	 intention	 to,	 I	 was	 going	 to	 work	 ...	 but	 I	 had	 to	 do	 something.	 So	 how	
    would	you	say	that?	I	was	going	to	work	today	…	today,	but	I	had	to	do	something.		
	
S:	 Θα	δούλευα	σήμερα	[tha	dhúleva	símera].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	δούλευα	σήμερα.	I	was	going	to	work	today,	but	...		
	
S:	 Αλλά	[alá].		
	
T:	 I	had	to	do	something.		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	κάνω	κάτι	[éprepe	na	káno	káti].		
	
T:	 Good.	I	was	going	to	work	today	but	I	had	to	do	something.	Θα	δούλευα	σήμερα	
    αλλά	 έπρεπε	 να	 κάνω	 κάτι	 [tha	 dhúleva	 símera	 alá	 éprepe	 na	 káno	 káti].	 I	 was	
    going	to	do	it	but	I	had	to	work.	I	was	going	to	do	it?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	έκανα	[tha	to	ékana].		
	
T:	 But	I	had	to	work.		
	
S:	 Αλλά	 έπρεπε	 να	 δουλεύω	 [alá	 éprepe	 na	 dhulévo]	 ...	 aah,	 να	 δουλέψω	 [na	
    dhulépso].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	έκανα	αλλά	έπρεπε	να	δουλέψω	[tha	to	ékana	alá	éprepe	na	dhulépso].	I	
    was	 going	 to	 work	 but	 I	 had	 to	 stay	 at	 home.	 So,	 I	 was	 going	 to	 work.	 I	 was	
    meaning	to	work.		
	


                                                                                               295
S:	 Θα	δούλευα	[tha	dhúleva].		
	
T:	 But.		
	
S:	 Αλλά	[alá].		
	
T:	 	I	had	to	stay	at	home.		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	μείνω	στο	σπίτι	[éprepe	na	míno	sto	spíti].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θα	 δούλευα	 αλλά	 έπρεπε	 να	 μείνω	 στο	 σπίτι	 [tha	 dhúleva	 alá	 éprepe	 na	
    míno	sto	spíti].	Or	we	could	just	say,	μείνω	σπίτι	[míno	spíti].	I	was	going	to	stay	
    home.	Θα	δούλευα	αλλά	έπρεπε	να	μείνω	σπίτι	[tha	dhúleva	alá	éprepe	na	míno	
    spíti].		
	
	 So,	Θα	το	έκανα	[tha	to	ékana]	gives	us	both,	“I	was	going	to	do	it”,	and	also	“I	
    would	do	it”,	depending	on	the	context,	no?	And	most	of	the	time	the	context	will	
    show	very	clearly	which	one	is	intended.	I	would	do	it,	or,	I	was	going	to	do	it.	But	
    there	might	be	room	for	ambiguity	if	most	of	the	context	is	in	your	head,	which	
    we	do	sometimes.	Sometimes	we	speak,	and	most	of	the	context	is	in	our	minds,	
    and	we	don’t	actually	say	it.	And	we	think	we’ve	been	understood,	but	we	might	
    be	understood	in	a	different	way.	This	happens	in	our	native	languages,	and	a	lot	
    of	the	time	we	can	be	unaware	of	it,	and	also	in	any	language	that	we’re	learning.	
    So	there’s	definitely	room	for	ambiguity	there.	So	just	be	careful	not	to	have	too	
    much	context	in	your	head.	I	would	do	it;	I	was	going	to	do	it.	There	we	have	two	
    quite	different	meanings.		
	
	 So	we	had,	Πρέπει	[prépi],	“Have	to”	or,	“It	is	necessary”.	And	the	past	of,	πρέπει	
    was?		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	[éprepe].		
	
T:	 Έπρεπε.	“The	clothes”	was,	τα	ρούχα	[ta	rukha].	Τα	ρούχα.		
	
S:	 Τα	ρούχα.	Τα	ρούχα.		
	
T:	 Τα	ρούχα.	He	had	to	change	his	clothes.	He	had	to	change	his	clothes.		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	αλλάξει	τα	ρούχα	του	[éprepe	na	aláksi	ta	rúkha	tu].		
	
T:	 Good.	Έπρεπε	να	αλλάξει	τα	ρούχα	του.	He	was	going	to	change	his	clothes.		
	
S:	 Θα	άλλαζε	τα	ρούχα	του	[tha	álaze	ta	rúkha	tu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	άλλαζε	τα	ρούχα	του.	So,	we	have,	έπρεπε	[éprepe],	no,	for	“It	was	
    necessary”	–	“had	to”.	If	we	say,	θα	έπρεπε	[tha	éprepe],	we	get	“should”.	So,	Θα	
    έπρεπε,	“It	would	be	necessary”,	gives	us	the	meaning	like	“should”.	So	there	may	


                                                                                       296
   be	a	slight	cross-over	in	these	meanings,	no?	Have	to	–	Should;	they’re	very	close	
   in	 meaning,	 but,	 generally	 speaking,	 θα	 έπρεπε	 is	 going	 to	 sound	 more	 like	
   “should”,	 maybe	 a	 little	 more	 polite,	 no?	 “It	 would	 be	 necessary”,	 rather	 than	
   Πρέπει	–	It	is	necessary;	Have	to.	So,	for	example,	You	should	change	your	clothes	
   –	It	would	be	necessary,	να,	you	change	your	clothes.		
	
S:	 Θα	έπρεπε	να	αλλάξεις	τα	ρούχα	σου	[tha	éprepe	na	aláksis	ta	rúkha	su].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θα	 έπρεπε	 να	 αλλάξεις	 τα	 ρούχα	 σου.	 And	 if	 you	 were	 to	 say	 “them”,	
    referring	to	the	clothes,	like,	You	should	change	them?		
	
S:	 Θα	έπρεπε	να	τους	αλλάξεις	[tha	éprepe	na	tus	aláksis].		
	
T:	 Why	“τους”	[tus]?		
	
S:	 Οh.	It’s,	τα	ρούχα	[ta	rúkha].	Θα	έπρεπε	να	τα	αλλάξεις	[tha	éprepe	na	ta	aláksis].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	έπρεπε	να	τα	αλλάξεις.	Well	done.

T:	 	Έδινα.	I	would	give?		
	
S:	 Θα	έδινα	[tha	édhina].		
	
T:	 Θα	έδινα.	You	might	hear	in	Greek,	in	conversation,	in	songs	as	well,	Και	τι	δεν	θα	
    έδινα	[ke	ti	dhen	tha	édhina].	What	does	that	mean?	Και	τι	δεν	θα	έδινα.		
	
S:	 And	what	wouldn’t	I	have	given.		
	
T:	 And	what	I	wouldn’t	give.		
	
S:	 Ah.		
	
T:	 No?	So	it’s	like,	you	know,	“What	I	wouldn’t	give	to	see	you”,	for	example.	“What	I	
    wouldn’t	give	to	do	that	again”.	No?	And,	“θα	έδινα”	[tha	édhina],	you	might	hear	
    contracted	as	well:	“θά	’δινα”	[thá	dhina],	θά	’δινα.	Και	τι	δεν	θά	’δινα.	Και	τι	δεν	
    θά	’δινα	να	σε	δω	[ke	ti	dhen	thá	dhina	na	se	dho]	–	to	see	you.	I	was	going	to	
    give	it	to	you.	I	would	give	it	to	you.	So,	you	know,	with	no	context,	it	could	easily	
    mean	either:	I	was	going	to	give	it	to	you;	I	would	give	it	to	you.		
	
S:	 Θα	στο	έδινα	[tha	sto	édhina].		
	
T:	 Θα	στο	έδινα.	Θα	σου	το	έδινα	[tha	su	to	édhina].		
	
	 Κουρασμένος	[kurazménos],	κουρασμένος,	means	“tired”.	Κουρασμένος.		
	
S:	 Κουρασμένος.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I’m	tired?		


                                                                                      298
	
S:	 Είμαι	κουρασμένος	[íme	kurazménos].		
	
T:	 Είμαι	κουρασμένος.	And	if	you	were	female?		
	
S:	 Είμαι	κουρασμένη	[íme	kurazméni].		
	
T:	 Είμαι	 κουρασμένη.	 Μένος	 [ménos]	 is	 quite	 a	 common	 ending	 for	 adjectives.	 So,	
    for	example,	you	might	look	up	the	word	“happy”.	If	you	were	to	look	up	the	word	
    “happy”,	you	would	find,	ευτuχισμένος	[eftichisménos].	Eυτuχισμένος.		
	
S:	 Ευτυχισμένος.		
	
T:	 So	that’s	a	long	word,	no?	And	the	first	thing	you	want	to	do	is	try	to	break	it	up.	
    So	the	first	thing	we	notice	straight	away	is	that	it	ends	“-μένος”	[ménos].	So	we	
    can	 get	 rid	 of	 that	 and	 look	 at	 “ευτύχι-”	 [eftíchi].	 Do	 you	 remember	 what	 “ευ”	
    [ef/ev]	means,	at	the	beginning	of	words,	mostly?		
	
S:	 Something	good.		
	
T:	 Good,	 good.	 And	 “τύχη”	 [tíchi]	 means	 “luck”.	 So	 ευτuχισμένος,	 ευτuχισμένος	
    means	something	like,	“good	lucky”,	and	that’s	the	word	for	“happy”.		
	
S:	 Ευτυχισμένος.		
	
T:	 I’m	happy?		
	
S:	 Είμαι	ευτυχισμένος	[íme	eftichisménos].		
	
T:	 Είμαι	ευτυχισμένος.	Είμαι	ευτυχισμένη	[íme	eftichisméni].	Are	you	happy?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	ευτυχισμένος;	[íse	eftichisménos?].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	 ευτυχισμένος,	 ευτυχισμένη;	 [íse	 eftichisménos,	 eftichisméni?].	 So	 this	 is	
    quite	 an	 interesting	 combination	 of	 meaning	 actually,	 to	 …	 to	 put	 “good”	 and	
    “lucky”	together	to	get	“happy”;	and	in	fact,	different	languages	do	this.	In	English	
    we	 have	 “happy-go-lucky”,	 no?	 Somebody	 that’s	 happy-go-lucky.	 The	 meaning	
    there	that	if	you	…	if	you	are	happy,	you	…	you	go	lucky,	no?	You	have	in	Arabic,	
    “said”	[sa-íd].	These	roots,	S-A-D	([s]-[a]-[d]);	you	might	know	these	names,	Said,	
    Saida,	 Assad;	 these	 roots	 relate	 to	 happiness	 and	 luck	 in	 Arabic.	 I	 don’t	 know	 if	
    you	have	any	German	expression	you	can	think	of,	that	combines	happiness	and	
    luck.		
	
S:	 It’s	in	German,	“being	happy”	is	Glücklich	sein.		
	
T:	 Oh,	Okay,	good	luck.		
	


                                                                                               299
S:	 Yes.	Well,	being	happy	is	like	being	in	luck,	kind	of.		
	
T:	 Exactly.	 So	 sometimes,	 in	 the	 way	 that	 words	 are	 built	 in	 languages,	 it	 feels	 like	
    the	language	itself,	in	silence,	in	fact,	is	suggesting	something,	just	by	building	the	
    word	in	a	certain	way.	And	I	think	this	suggestion	that’s	coming	through,	in	many	
    different	 languages,	 this	 connection	 between	 happiness	 and	 luck,	 is	 that	 if	 you	
    bring	 happiness,	 you	 bring	 luck.	 No?	 That	 if	 you	 …	 that	 happiness	 is	 maybe	 a	
    choice,	 whilst	 luck	 definitely	 doesn’t	 feel	 like	 one.	 Maybe	 the	 language	 is	
    suggesting	there	that	luck	is	more	of	a	choice	than	we	think	it	is	–	that	we	can	be	
    appreciative	 and	 happy,	 and	 in	 turn	 become	 lucky	 inside.	 I	 think	 that’s	 the	
    inherent	wisdom	there.		
	
	 So,	give	me	again,	I	am	happy.		
	
S:	 Είμαι	ευτυχισμένος	[íme	eftichisménos].		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 we	 have	 είμαι	 [íme],	 for	 “I	 am”.	 “I	 was”	 is	 ήμουν	 [ímun],	 or	 ήμουνα	
    [ímuna];	 we	 can	 have	 either.	 So	 that’s	 kind	 of	 irregular,	 no?	 It’s	 not	 following	
    many	 of	 our	 “past”	 rules.	 We	 have	 the	 A	 (α)	 on	 the	 end,	 but,	 you	 know,	 it’s	
    irregular:	 είμαι	 –	 ήμουν	 [íme,	 ímun].	 Just	 like	 in	 English,	 “I	 am”	 and	 “I	 was”;	 we	
    don’t	have	any	rule	to	move	between	“am”	and	“was”.		
	
S:	 Ήμουν	[ímun].		
	
T:	 Ήμουν,	or	ήμουνα	[ímuna].	So,	I	was	happy,	or,	I	used	to	be	happy.		
	
S:	 Ήμουν	ευτυχισμένος	[ímun	eftichisménos].		
	
T:	 Ήμουν	ευτυχισμένος,	ευτυχισμένη	[eftichisméni].	I	would	be	happy.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήμουν	ευτυχισμένος	[tha	ímun	eftichisménos].		
	
T:	 Θα	ήμουν	ευτυχισμένος.	I	was	tired.		
	
S:	 Ήμουν	κουρασμένος	[ímun	kurazménos].		
	
T:	 Ήμουν	 κουρασμένος.	 Ήμουν	 κουρασμένη	 [ímun	 kurazméni].	 So	 we	 have,	 είμαι	
    [íme]	–	“I	am”,	and,	ήμουν	[ímun]	–	“I	was”.	We	have,	είσαι	[íse]	–	“you	are”,	and	
    what	might,	You	were,	be,	if	we	have	είμαι	–	ήμουν,	είσαι	–	...	?		
	
S:	 Ήσουν	[ísun].		
	
T:	 Ήσουν,	You	were,	ήσουν.	Where	were	you?		
	
S:	 Πού	ήσουν;	[pu	ísun?].		
	
T:	 Πού	ήσουν;	Were	you	happy?		


                                                                                                300
	
S:	 Ήσουν	ευτυχισμένος;	[ísun	eftichisménos?].		
	
T:	 	Weren’t	you	happy	there?	Weren’t	you	happy	there?		
	
S:	 Δεν	ήσουν	ευτυχισμένος	εκεί;	[dhen	ísun	eftichisménos	ekí?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 ήσουν	 ευτυχισμένος	 εκεί;	 Δεν	 ήσουν	 ευτυχισμένη	 εκεί;	 [dhen	 ísun	
    eftichisméni	ekí?].		
	
	 “I	take”,	was	παίρνω	[pérno].	Παίρνω,	I	take.		
	
S:	 Παίρνω.		
	
T:	 And	we	mentioned	how,	παίρνω	τηλέφωνο	[pérno	tiléfono],	“I	take	phone”,	can	
    be	used	like	to	…	“to	call”.	So,	I’m	calling	you.	We	say,	I	take	you	phone.		
	
S:	 Σου	παίρνω	τηλέφωνο	[su	pérno	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 But	here	the	“you”	doesn’t	mean,	“from	you”,	or	“for	you”,	or	even	“to	you”.	So	
    it’s	not	like,	you	know,	“I	take	to	you,	or	from	you,	the	telephone”.	It’s	like,	“I	take	
    you	phone”.	We	don’t	use	σου	[su].		
	
S:	 Σε	παίρνω	τηλέφωνο	[se	pérno	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Σε,	 σε	 παίρνω	 τηλέφωνο.	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 was	 calling	 you.	 I	 was	
    calling	you?		
	
S:	 Σε	έπαιρνα	τηλέφωνο	[se	éperna	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Σε	έπαίρνα	τηλέφωνο	[se	épérna	tiléfono].	I	was	going	to	call;	I	would	
    call	you.		
	
S:	 Θα	σε	έπαιρνα	τηλέφωνο	[tha	se	éperna	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	σε	έπαίρνα	τηλέφωνο	[tha	se	épérna	tiléfono].	I	was	going	to	call	
    you,	but	I	was	tired.	So,	I	was	going	to	call	you.		
	
S:	 Θα	σε	έπαιρνα	τηλέφωνο	[tha	se	éperna	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 But	I	was	tired.		
	
S:	 Αλλά	ήμουν	κουρασμένος	[alá	ímun	kurazménos].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αλλά	ήμουν	κουρασμένος.	Aλλά	ήμουν	κουρασμένη	[alá	ímun	kurazméni].	
    The	closed	version	of	παίρνω	[pérno]	was,	πάρω	[páro].	Πάρω.		
	


                                                                                           301
S:	 Πάρω.		
	
T:	 So	 we	 lose	 the	 N	 (ν),	 no,	 of	 παίρνω	 [pérno],	 but	 also	 it’s	 a	 little	 irregular.	 The	
    vowel	changes:	παίρνω	/	πάρω	[pérno	/	páro].	You	had	to	call	me.	So	this	is	just

S:	 Έπρεπε	να	με	πάρεις	τηλέφωνο	[éprepe	na	me	páris	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Έπρεπε	 να	 με	 πάρεις	 τηλέφωνο.	 And,	 You	 should	 call	 me.	 So,	 It	 would	 be

T:	 Good.	But	it’s	important	to	think	about	what	we’re	saying	literally,	no?	It	would	be	
    necessary,	something	like	that.		
	
S:	 Θα	έπρεπε	[tha	éprepe].		
	
T:	 Θα	έπρεπε,	not,	Θα	έπρεπες	[tha	éprepes].

T:	 What	was,	Have	to,	or,	It	is	necessary?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	[prépi].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει.	And	the	past	of	that?		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	[éprepe].		
	
T:	 Έπρεπε.	What	is,	I	do?		
	
S:	 Κάνω	[káno].		
	
T:	 And	the	past:	I	did;	I	was	doing?		
	
S:	 Έκανα	[ékana].		
	
T:	 Έκανα.	So	we’ve	seen	that	sometimes	we	need	to	add	an	[e],	no,	an	extra	syllable,	
    onto	the	beginning	of	the	verb,	to	be	able	to	pull	that	accent	back	into	the	past.	
    So,	 this	 sound	 that	 we	 add	 on	 to	 the	 beginning	 of	 verbs	 to	 do	 this,	 the	 great	
    majority	 of	 the	 time	 is	 an	 E	 (ε);	 but	 sometimes	 we	 add	 an	 I	 (η),	 with	 some	
    important	 and	 common	 verbs	 too.	 It	 doesn’t	 happen	 very	 often,	 but	 it	 does	
    happen	 with	 some	 quite	 important	 verbs,	 like	 “I	 want”,	 for	 example.	 What	 is,	 I	
    want?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	[thélo].		
	
T:	 Θέλω.	“I	wanted”	is	ήθελα	[íthela].	Ήθελα.		
	
S:	 Ήθελα.		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 here	 we	 are	 adding	 an	 I	 (η)	 to	 get	 that	 extra	 syllable.	 Ήθελα.	 They	
    wanted?		
	
S:	 Θέλανε	[thélane].		
	
T:	 Θέλανε,	or	...	?		
	
S:	 Ήθελαν	[íthelan].		
	
T:	 Ήθελαν.	We	wanted?		
	
S:	 Θέλαμε	[thélame].		
	
T:	 Θέλαμε.	 There	 we	 don’t	 add	 anything,	 no,	 because	 “-αμε”	 [ame]	 has	 two	
    syllables.	Θέλαμε.	He	wanted;	She	wanted;	even,	It	wanted?		


                                                                                             303
	
S:	 Ήθελα	[íthela],	Ήθελε	[íthele].		
	
T:	 Ήθελε	[íthele].	You	wanted?		
	
S:	 Ήθελες	[ítheles].		
	
T:	 Ήθελες.	I	would	want.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήθελα	[tha	íthela].		
	
T:	 Θα	ήθελα.	So,	I	would	want,	θα	ήθελα,	you	can	also	use	it,	like,	“I	would	like”;	θα	
    ήθελα,	I	would	like.		
	
	 “A	kebab”,	a	kebab,	in	Greek	is,	ένας	γύρος	[énas	yíros],	ένας	γύρος.	Ένας	γύρος.		
	
S:	 ‘Ενας	γύρος.		
	
T:	 And	this	actually	means	“turn”	or	“turning”	–	turning	things,	something	like	that.	
    And	actually,	“donar”,	or	“dunar”,	in	Turkish,	also	means	“turned”,	“to	turn”.	So	
    this	 is,	 of	 course,	 referring	 to	 the	 little	 machine	 that	 turns	 around	 to	 cook	 the	
    meat,	no?	So	we	have,	ένας	γύρος	–	a	kebab.		
	
S:	 Ένας	γύρος.		
	
T:	 When	“a	kebab”	is	behaving	like	“him”,	ένας	[énas]	acts	like	τον	[ton],	rather	than	
    acting	like	a	noun;	it	becomes	“έναν”	[énan].	It	doesn’t	lose	its	S	(ς);	the	S	(ς)	turns	
    into	 an	 N	 (ν).	 So	 it	 …	 it	 looks	 like	 “τον”	 [ton],	 no?	 So,	 if	 you	 say,	 for	 example,	 I	
    would	like	a	kebab.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήθελα	έναν	γύρο	[tha	íthela	énan	yíro].		
	
T:	 Very	 good;	 also	 for	 changing	 γύρο	 [yíro],	 no?	 So,	 γύρος	 [yíros]	 acts	 like	 a	
    masculine	noun;	we	drop	the	S	(ς)	and	we	get	γύρο,	when	it’s	behaving	like	“him”.	
    But	ένας	[énas]	acts	like	τον	[ton];	it	becomes	έναν	[énan].		
	
	 We	had	άλλος	[álos]	for	“another”,	or	άλλο	[álos],	άλλη	[áli];	όλος	[ólos]	gives	us	
    “all”	 or	 “every”,	 no?	 So,	 we	 have	 άλλος	 [álos]	 and	 όλος	 [ólos].	 If	 you	 say,	 ένας	
    γύρος	 από	 όλa	 [énas	 yíros	 apó	 óla],	 από	 όλa	 –	 “from	 all”,	 “of	 all”,	 and	 we	 are	
    using	the	neuter	plural	there,	no?	Όλα	[óla]	–	it	means	“with	everything”.	So,	you	
    know,	 if	 you	 ask	 for	 a	 kebab,	 you	 will	 have	 different	 salads	 to	 put	 in	 there,	 and	
    different	sauces.	If	you	just	say,	από	όλa	[apó	óla],	it	means	“with	everything”.	So,	
    I	would	like	a	kebab	with	everything.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήθελα	έναν	γύρο	από	όλa	[tha	íthela	énan	yíro	apó	óla].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	ήθελα	έναν	γύρο	από	όλa.	I	know?		


                                                                                                      304
	
S:	 Ξέρω	[kséro].		
	
T:	 Ξέρω.	“I	knew”,	is	ήξερα	[íksera].	Ήξερα.		
	
S:	 Ήξερα.		
	
T:	 So	 again	 another	 common	 verb,	 no,	 using	 [i]	 (η)	 to	 get	 an	 extra	 syllable.	 Ήξερα.	
    We	knew?		
	
S:	 Ξέραμε	[ksérame].		
	
T:	 Ξέραμε.	Here	we	don’t	need	it,	no,	the	extra	syllable.	They	knew?		
	
S:	 Ξέρανε	[ksérane].		
	
T:	 Ξέρανε,	or	...	?		
	
S:	 Ήξεραν	[íkseran].		
	
T:	 Ήξεραν.	He	knew?		
	
S:	 Ήξερε	[íksere].		
	
T:	 And,	Did	you	know?		
	
S:	 Ήξερες;	[íkseres?].		
	
T:	 Did	you	know	it?		
	
S:	 Το	ήξερες;	[to	íkseres?].		
	
T:	 Good.	 I	 wanted	 to	 tell	 you	 something.	 So,	 I	 wanted	 to	 tell	 you	 something.	 How	
    would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Ήθελα	να	σου	πω	κάτι	[íthela	na	su	po	káti].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ήθελα	να	σου	πω	κάτι.	So	again,	we’re	not	going	in	to	the	past	again,	
    after	“να”	[na],	no?	It’s	like,	“to	tell”;	and	we	just	then	need	to	decide	if	we	want	
    the	open	or	the	closed	version	of	the	verb.	Ήθελα	να	σου	πω	κάτι.	I	wanted	to	tell	
    you	something.		
	
	 I	wanted	you	to	tell	me.	So,	like,	you	know,	I	wanted	to	hear	it	from	you.	I	wanted	
    you	to	tell	me	it.		
	
S:	 Ήθελα	να	μου	το	πεις	[íthela	na	mu	to	pis].		
	


                                                                                              305
T:	 	And	 if	 you	 were	 to	 use	 “you”,	 and	 be	 emphatic.	 I	 wanted	 you	 to	 tell	 me	 it.	 I	
    wanted	to	hear	it	from	you.		
	
S:	 Ήθελα	να	μου	το	πεις	εσύ	[íthela	na	mu	to	pis	esí].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ήθελα	να	μου	το	πεις	εσύ.	Good.	And,	“να	μου	το	πεις”	[na	mu	to	pis],	
    you	wouldn’t	separate	with	“εσύ”	[esí],	if	you	wanted	to	put	it	earlier.	You	can’t	
    say,	“να	εσύ	μου	το	πεις”	[na	esí	mu	to	pis].	“Nα	μου	το	πεις”,	kind	of	comes	all	
    together.	So	you	can	say,	Ήθελα	να	μου	το	πεις	εσύ	[íthela	na	mu	to	pis	esí],	or,	
    Ήθελα	εσύ	να	μου	το	πεις	[íthela	esí	na	mu	to	pis].		
	
	 With	these	short	closed	versions	of	one	syllable,	like	πω	[po],	we	will	also	add	an	I	
    (ει),	an	[i]	sound,	to	go	into	the	past.	Είπα	[ípa]	is	“I	said”.		
	
S:	 Είπα.		
	
T:	 We	don’t	get	three	syllables	but,	you	know,	we	get	an	extra	one	at	least	when	we	
    add	that	[í]	(εί)	onto	πω.	So,	είπa	[ípa]	–	“I	said”.	He	said?		
	
S:	 Είπε	[ípe].		
	
T:	 You	said?		
	
S:	 Είπες	[ípes].		
	
T:	 Είπες.	What	did	you	say?		
	
S:	 Τι	είπες;	[ti	ípes?].		
	
T:	 Τι	είπες.	I	told	you.		
	
S:	 Σου	είπα	[su	ípa].		
	
T:	 Σου	είπα.	What	did	I	tell	you?	What	did	I	tell	you?		
	
S:	 Τι	σου	είπα;	[ti	su	ípa?].		
	
T:	 Τι	σου	είπα;	We	said.	We	told.		
	
S:	 Είπαμε	[ípame].		
	
T:	 Είπαμε.	So,	even	in	the	“we”	form,	no,	we	still	have	this	[í]	(εί)	addition,	because	
    the	verb	is	so	short.	Είπαμε.	And	it’s	the	only	time	actually	we	get	the	accent	third	
    from	the	end,	no,	where	we	want	it	in	the	past	–	Είπαμε.	Well,	not	the	only	time.	
    We	could	have	...	how	is,	They	said,	or,	They	told?		
	
S:	 Είπαν	[ípan].		


                                                                                              306
	
T:	 Είπαν,	or	είπανε	[ípane].	No?	We	can	have	either.	Είπαν,	or	είπανε.	So	there	again	
    third	 from	 the	 end.	 Είπανε	 [ípane].	 You	 didn’t	 tell	 me	 where	 you	 were.	 So,	 You	
    didn’t	tell	me	...	?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	είπες	[dhen	mu	ípes].		
	
T:	 Where	you	were.		
	
S:	 Πού	ήσουν	[pu	ísun].		
	
T:	 Πού	ήσουν.	Very	good.	Δεν	μου	είπες	πού	ήσουν	[dhen	mu	ípes	pu	ísun].	So	we	
    have	 ήσουν	 [ísun],	 for	 “You	 were”,	 and	 “I	 was”	 is,	 ήμουν	 [ímun].	 No?	 We	 have,	
    like,	 ήμουν	 [ímun]	 and	 ήσουν	 [ísun],	 looking	 very	 similar.	 So,	 ήμουν	 –	 “I	 was”.	 I	
    would	be,	or,	I	was	going	to	be?		
	
S:	 Θα	ήμουν	[tha	ímun].		
	
T:	 Θα	ήμουν.	I	was	going	to	be	there	but	they	told	me	to	stay	here,	or,	I	would	be	
    there	but	they	told	me	to	stay	here.	Both	could	fit,	no,	in	this	context.	So,	the	first	
    bit	is,	I	would	be	there	/	I	was	going	to	be	there.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήμουν	εκεί	[tha	ímun	ekí].		
	
T:	 Θα	ήμουν	εκεί	...	But	they	told	me.		
	
S:	 Αλλά	μου	είπανε	[alá	mu	ípane].		
	
T:	 Αλλά	μου	είπανε,	Αλλά	μου	είπαν	[alá	mu	ípan]	...	To	stay	here.		
	
S:	 Να	μείνω	εδώ	[na	míno	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θα	 ήμουν	 εκεί.	 Or,	 we	 could	 also	 contract	 that:	 Θα	 ’μουν,	 Θα	 ’μουν	
    εκεί	[tha’mun	ekí].	But	they	told	me	to	stay	here:	αλλά	μου	είπαν,	μου	είπανε,	να	
    μείνω	εδώ	[alá	mu	ípan,	mu	ípane,	na	míno	edhó].	But	they	told	me	to	stay	here.		
	
	 What	was,	I	see?		
	
S:	 Βλέπω	[vlépo].		
	
T:	 Βλέπω.	And	the	closed	version	of,	I	see?		
	
S:	 Δω	[dho].		
	
T:	 Δω.	“I	saw”,	is	είδα	[ídha].	Είδα.		
	
S:	 Είδα.		


                                                                                               307
	
T:	 So	again	we	are	adding	a	syllable	with	this	short	[i]	(εί)	sound.	We	saw?		
	
S:	 Είδαμε	[ídhame].		
	
T:	 Είδαμε.	They	saw.		
	
S:	 Είδαν	[ídhan].		
	
T:	 Or	...	?		
	
S:	 Είδανε	[ídhane].		
	
T:	 Είδανε,	είδαν.	Good.	He	saw.		
	
S:	 Είδε	[ídhe].		
	
T:	 Είδε.	And,	You	saw.		
	
S:	 Είδες	[ídhes].		
	
T:	 Είδες,	 which	 you	 can	 also	 use	 like	 as	 an	 expression,	 no?	 Like,	 “You	 know	 what	 I	
    mean”.	Είδες;	[ídhes?].		
	
	 So	 generally,	 when	 we	 need	 to	 add	 on	 a	 syllable,	 to	 go	 into	 the	 past	 with	 our	
    verbs,	that’s	going	to	be	an	[e]	(ε).	But	in	some	cases,	with	some	quite	common	
    verbs,	it’s	going	to	be	an	[i]	sound	(η),	like	in,	ήθελα	[íthela]	–	“I	wanted”;	ήξερα	
    [íksera]	–	“I	knew”.	And	also	with	these	verbs	that	just	become,	like,	one	syllable	
    in	their	closed	form,	like	είπα	[ípa]	–	“I	said”;	είδα	[ídha]	–	“I	saw”.

    Good.	Αυτοί	είναι	οι	αγαπημένοι	μου,	επειδή	είναι	πιό	μεγάλοι	–	επειδή	/	γιατί	
    είναι	μεγαλύτεροι	[aftí	íne	i	aghapiméni	mu,	epidhí	íne	pyo	megháli	–	epidhí	/	yatí	
    íne	meghalíteri].		
	
	 Ωραίος	[oréos],	ωραίος,	means	“nice”.	Ωραίος.		
	
S:	 Ωραίος.		
	
T:	 It’s	nice.		
	
S:	 Είναι	ωραίο	[íne	oréo].		
	
T:	 Είναι	ωραίο.	They	are	nice.		
	
S:	 Είναι	ωραίοι	[íne	oréi].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Είναι	 ωραίοι.	 So	 this	 would	 actually	 refer	 to	 things.	 Ωραίος	 means	
    nice,	 when	 it	 refers	 to	 things.	 If	 we	 refer	 to	 people,	 it	 means,	 like,	 pretty	 or	
    handsome.	So	how	would	we	say	that?	They	are	pretty;	They	are	handsome.		
	
S:	 Είναι	ωραίοι	[íne	oréi].		
	
T:	 Yes,	the	same.	Είναι	ωραίοι.	So,	we	saw	before,	ώρα	[óra]	–	“hour”,	and	ωραίος	is	
    actually	connected	to	hour;	they	both	start	with	the	ωμέγα	[omégha]	(Ω/ω),	also.	
    And,	yes,	so	that	means	something	like,	“in	its	time”,	“in	its	hour”,	“on	its	hour”,	
    something	like	this.	Maybe	just	another	way	of	saying,	“well-formed”.	So	we	have,	
    ωραίος	[oréos]	for	nice,	well,	when	referring	to	things,	at	least;	referring	to	people	
    it	means,	like	pretty	or	handsome;	connected	to	ώρα	[óra]	–	and	spelt	in	the	same	
    way	with	the	O	[o],	the	ωμέγα	[omégha],	that	looks	like	a	“w”	(ω).	So	looking	at	
    this,	the	plural,	“ωραίοι”	[oréi],	we	have	the	omega	(ω).	And	then	we	have	the	R	
    (ρ),	which	looks	like	a	“P/p”	in	Greek.	So	when	you	see	a	letter	that	looks	like	a	P,	
    that’s	an	R.	Then	the	[e]	sound	here	is	with	AI	(αι);	we	said	that	the	combination	
    of	“A-I/α-ι”	 gives	us	the	 [e]	 sound.	 And	then	the	 [i]	 on	 the	end	 is	the	plural,	 O-I	
    (οι).	So	on	the	end	of	ωραίοι	[oréi],	the	plural	of	ωραίος	[oréos],	no,	we	get	AI–OI,	
    α-ι–ο-ι,	giving	us	[e]–[i],	no?	So	not	[ai]–[ο]–[e]!		
	




                                                                                               311
	 I	 should	 mention	 as	 well	 that	 we	 will	 prepare	 a	 book	 for	 writing	 in	 Greek,	 for	
    reading	and	writing	in	Greek,	both	hand	writing	and	printed	script.	And	that	will	
    include	all	of	these	different	ways	of	writing	vowels,	etc.,	with	a	whole	bunch	of	
    other	 fascinating	 stuff	 about	 the	 history	 of	 writing.	 That	 might	 be	 ready	 by	 the	
    time	you	hear	this.	Or	you	can	join	the	campaign	to	support	LT	and	vote	for	it.	You	
    can	vote	for	that	publication	to	come	quicker.	So	you	can	check	that	out	on	the	
    web	site	under	the	Support	tab	–	“Voting	Campaign”.	So,	It	is,	or	They	are?		
	
S:	 Είναι	[íne].		
	
T:	 Είναι.	The	past	of,	είναι	[íne]	is,	ήταν	[ítan].	Ήταν.		
	
S:	 Ήταν.		
	
T:	 Or,	ήτανε	[ítane];	you	can	hear	either.	Ήτανε,	ήταν	[ítane,	ítan].		
	
S:	 Ήτανε.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	for	he,	she,	it,	and	they.	No?	So	we	have	είναι	[íne]	in	the	present	for	he,	
    she,	it,	and	they:	he/she/it	is,	they	are;	and	ήταν/ήτανε	[ítan/ítane]	in	the	past	for	
    he/she/it	was,	or,	they	were.	Ήταν	actually	even	has	the	past	ending	of	“they”,	no,	
    if	you	think	about	it;	ends	in	“αν”,	no,	or	“ανε”:	ήταν/ήτανε	[ítan/ítane].	It	was	my	
    favourite.	Again,	you	can	choose	the	gender.		
	
S:	 Ήταν	το	αγαπημένο	μου	[ítan	to	aghapiméno	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	Ήταν	το	αγαπημένο	μου.	They	were	nicer.		
	
S:	 Ήτανε	πιό	ωραίοι	[ítane	pyo	oréi].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Ήτανε	 πιό	 ωραίοι.	 So	 that	 would	 be	 masculine	 things.	 And	 for	 feminine	
    things?		
	
S:	 Ήτανε	πιό	ωραίες	[ítane	pyo	oré-es].		
	
T:	 Ωραίες	[orées].		
	
S:	 Ωραίες.		
	
T:	 Good.	You	can	join	those	E’s	together,	nο?	Ήτανε	πιό	ωραίες	[ítane	pyo	orées].	If	
    you	 refer	 to	 things	 of	 mixed	 gender	 …	 so,	 we’ve	 seen	 that	 when	 we	 refer	 to	
    people	 of	 mixed	 gender,	 we	 use	 the	 masculine.	 If	 we	 refer	 to	 things	 of	 mixed	
    gender,	we	will	use	the	neuter.	We	will	use	the	neuter	for	things.	So	how	would	
    you	say,	Τhey	were	nicer	–	things	of	mixed	gender?		
	
S:	 Ήτανε	πιό	ωραία	[ítane	pyo	oréa].		
	


                                                                                             312
T:	 Ήτανε,	ήταν	πιό	ωραία	[ítane,	ítan	pyo	oréa].	Good.	So	this	is	like,	τα	πράγματα	
    [ta	prághmata],	no?	The	mind	goes	to	things,	The	things	were.	It	was	my	favourite	
    but	I	saw	another.	So,	It	was	my	favourite?		
	
S:	 Ήτανε	το	αγαπημένο	μου	[ítane	to	aghapiméno	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	Ήτανε	το	αγαπημένο	μου	...	But?		
	
S:	 Αλλά	[alá].		
	
T:	 Αλλά	 ...	 I	 saw	 another	 one.	 So,	 for	 “another	 one”,	 we	 will	 say	 “one	 other”,	 one	
    other.		
	
S:	 Είδα	ένα	άλλο	[ídha	éna	álo].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Αλλά	 είδα	 ένα	 άλλο	 [alá	 ídha	 éna	 álo].	 So	 you	 chose	 a	 neuter	 thing,	 no?	
    Ήταν	 το	 αγαπημένο	 μου	 αλλά	 είδα	 εν’	 άλλο	 [ítan	 to	 aghapiméno	 mu	 alá	 ídha	
    en’álo].	If	you	were	to	say,	I	saw	another	one,	and	you	meant	a	masculine	thing,	
    άλλος	 [álos]	 behaves	 likes	 the	 word	 for	 “the”,	 rather	 than	 like	 a	 noun.	 So,	 how	
    would	you	say,	I	saw	another	one,	and	you	mean	a	masculine	thing?		
	
S:	 Αλλά	είδα	έναν	άλλον	[alá	ídha	énan	álon].		
	
T:	 Είδα	έναν	άλλον.	So	both	ένας	[énas]	and	άλλος	[álos]	behave	like	τον	[ton].	So	
    we	get	an	N	(ν)	on	the	end,	rather	than	behaving	like	a	noun,	and	just	losing	the	S	
    (ς).	 Είδα	 έναν	 άλλον	 [ídha	 énan	 álon].	 Good.	 Although	 you	 will	 hear	 the	 people	
    not	 bothering	 to	 put	 that	 N	 (ν)	 on	 άλλον	 [álon],	 so	 you	 may	 hear	 άλλο	 [álo],	 as	
    well:	 Έναν	 άλλο	 [énan	 álo].	 And	 you	 only	 need	 to	 worry	 about	 this	 for	 the	
    masculine.	So,	if	you	said,	for	example,	I	saw	the	other	one,	a	feminine	thing,	or	a	
    female.		
	
S:	 Είδα	την	άλλη	[ídha	tin	áli].		
	
T:	 Good.	But,	I	saw	the	other	one,	and	we	mean	a	masculine	thing?		
	
S:	 Είδα	τον	άλλον	[ídha	ton	álon].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Είδα	 τον	 άλλον.	 Good.	 I	 didn’t	 see	 another	 one.	 So,	 another	 one,	 now,	
    rather	than,	the	other	one.		
	
S:	 Δεν	είδα	έναν	άλλον	[dhen	ídha	énan	álon].

Complete	Greek,	Track	69	–	Language	Transfer		
	
T:	 So	we’ve	seen	how	we	need	the	accent	third	from	the	end,	in	the	past	tense,	in	
    Greek.	 And	 if	 we	 don’t	 have	 three	 syllables,	 we	 will	 add	 a	 syllable	 onto	 the	
    beginning,	to	make	the	verb	longer.	And	this	is	usually	an	E	(ε),	but	it	can	also	be	
    an	I	(η),	like	we	saw	in	θέλω	[thélo]	–	“Ι	want”,	and	ήθελα	[íthela]	–	“Ι	wanted”.		
	
	 We	had	παίρνω	[pérno]	–	“I	take”.	And	what	was	the	closed	version	of,	παίρνω?		
	
S:	 Πάρω	[páro].		
	
T:	 Πάρω.	Good.	So	how	would	you	say,	I	would	like	to	take	it.	So	we	can	say,	I	would	
    want	to	take	it.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήθελα	να	το	πάρω	[tha	íthela	na	to	páro].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Literally,	 I	 would	 want	 to	 take	 it.	 Θα	 ήθελα	 να	 το	 πάρω.	 I	 would	 want,	 I	
    would	like	to	take	it	–	and	we	mean	a	masculine	thing.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήθελα	να	τον	πάρω	[tha	íthela	na	ton	páro].		
	
T:	 Θα	ήθελα	να	τον	πάρω.	I	would	like	to	take	one,	and	we	mean	a	masculine	thing.	I	
    would	like	to	take	one.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήθελα	να	πάρω	έναν	[tha	íthela	na	páro	énan].		
	
T:	 	Very	good.	Θα	ήθελα	να	πάρω	έναν.	So,	some	words	act	like	the	words	for	“the”,	
    no,	like,	τον	[ton],	rather	than	acting	like	a	noun.	Ένας	[énas]	doesn’t	lose	its	S	(ς),	
    no?	The	S	(ς)	turns	to	an	N	(ν).	Θα	ήθελα	να	πάρω	έναν.	What	was,	I	have?		
	
S:	 Έχω	[ékho].		
	
T:	 Έχω.	Έχω	goes	into	the	past	in	a	similar	way	to	είδα	[ídha]	–	“I	saw”;	είπα	[ípa]	–	“I	
    said”.	For,	“I	had”,	we	have	είχα	[íkha].	Είχα.		
	
S:	 Είχα.		
	
T:	 Είχα.	I	had	another	one,	masculine.		
	
S:	 Είχα	άλλον	…	έναν	άλλον	[íkha	álon	…	énan	álon].		
	
T:	 Είχα	έναν	άλλον	[íkha	énan	álon].	I	had	other	ones,	still	masculine.		
	
S:	 Είχα	άλλοι	[íkha	áli].		
	
T:	 So,	 Είχα	 άλλοι,	 sounds	 like	 the	 feminine:	 είχα	 άλλη	 [íkha	 áli].	 I	 had	 another	
    feminine	one	…	in	the	singular.	Why	doesn’t	it	sound	like	the	masculine	plural?		


                                                                                              314
	
	S:	Because	it	turns	to,	άλλους	[álus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.	So,	I	had	other	ones?		
	
S:	 Είχα	άλλους	[íkha	álus].		
	
T:	 Είχα	 άλλους.	 No?	 So	 there,	 there’s	 no	 difference	 actually	 between	 the	 word	 for	
    “the”	 and	 the	 nouns.	 No?	 For	 example,	 if	 we	 said,	 I	 had	 the	 other	 ones.	 How	
    would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Είχα	τους	άλλους	[íkha	tus	álus].		
	
T:	 Είχα	τους	άλλους.	No?	They	do	the	same	thing:	τους	[tus]	and	άλλους	[álus].	Είχα	
    άλλους.	 Είχα	 τους	 άλλους.	 So	 we	 had,	 άλλος	 [álos],	 no	 –	 “another”,	 in	 the	
    masculine,	and	όλος	[ólos],	which	would	be	“all”,	in	the	masculine.	Όλος	[ólos].		
	
S:	 Όλος.		
	
T:	 And	 we	 also	 have	 “όλος”	 hanging	 around	 English	 –	 in,	 for	 example,	 “hologram”,	
    which	 means	 something	 like	 all,	 or	 whole,	 or	 entirely-gram,	 written	 like	 γράφω	
    [ghráfo].	 Hologram.	 So,	 not	 from	 “hollow”,	 as	 we	 might	 think.	 And	 what	 would	
    όλος	be	in	the	neuter	plural?	If	you	put	όλος	into	the	neuter	plural.		
	
S:	 Όλα	[óla].		
	
T:	 Όλα.	You	can	use	that	like,	“everything”.	You	can	say,	Tα	έχω	όλα	[ta	ékho	óla]	–	“I	
    have	everything”,	“I	have	it	all”.	Τα	έχω	όλα.		
	
S:	 Τα	έχω	όλα.		
	
T:	 So	it’s	like	the	English,	where	we	say,	“I	had	all	of	it”,	because	we	say	“τα”	[ta]	and	
    “όλα”	 [óla].	 No?	 Even	 though	 we	 have	 the	 plural	 here,	 more	 like,	 “I	 have	 all	 of	
    them”.	Τα	έχω	όλα	[ta	ékho	óla].	I	had?		
	
S:	 Είχα	[íkha].		
	
T:	 Είχα.	He	had,	She	had,	It	had?		
	
S:	 Είχε	[íche].		
	
T:	 Είχε.	You	had?		
	
S:	 Είχες	[íches].

S:	 Τα	είχες	όλα	[ta	íches	óla].		
	
T:	 Τα	είχες	όλα.	The	word	for	“always”,	is	πάντα	[pánda].	Πάντα.		
	
S:	 Πάντα.		
	
T:	 And,	 τα	 πάντα	 [ta	 pánda],	 you	 can	 use,	 like,	 “everything”,	 as	 well.	 Τα	 πάντα.	 So	
    you	have	“always”	–	πάντα	[pánda],	and	then,	τα	πάντα	[ta	pánda].	You	make	it	
    like	a	noun	and	you	get	“everything”.	So	you	could	say,	You	had	everything;	You	
    had	it	all.		
	
S:	 Είχες	τα	πάντα	[íches	ta	pánda].		
	
T:	 Είχες	τα	πάντα.	We	had	it	all?		
	
S:	 Είχαμε	τα	πάντα	[íkhame	ta	pánda].		
	
T:	 Είχαμε	τα	πάντα.	So	we’ve	seen	όλα	[óla],	like	“everything”,	no,	but	όλος	[ólos],	
    like	in	the	…	in	the	singular,	or	όλο	[ólo]	or	όλη	[óli],	would	be	more	like	“all”.	So,	
    for	 example,	 you	 could	 say,	“all	 the	bread”	–	 όλο	 το	 ψωμί	 [ólo	 to	psomí].	 Ψωμί	
    [psomí]	is	“bread”.		
	
S:	 Ψωμί.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	They	had	all	the	bread?		
	
S:	 Είχαν	όλο	το	ψωμί	[íkhan	ólo	to	psomí].		
	
T:	 Good.	Είχαν,	είχανε,	όλο	το	ψωμί	[íkhan,	íkhane,	ólo	to	psomí].	If	you	were	to	say,	
    “They	had	all	the	coffee”,	do	you	think	the	word	“all”	would	behave	like	a	noun,	
    or	behave	like	the	words	for	“the”,	in	“all	the	coffee”?	How	do	you	think	it	would	
    behave?		
	
S:	 I	think	like	the	words	for	“the”.		
	
T:	 That	makes	more	sense,	no?	That’s	kind	of	what	it’s	doing,	no?	So	how	would	you	
    say	that,	You	had	all	the	coffee?		
	
S:	 Είχες	όλον	τον	καφέ	[íches	ólon	ton	kafé].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Είχες	όλον	τον	καφέ.	Εσύ	είχες	όλον	τον	καφέ	[esí	íches	ólon	ton	kafé].	
    But	 like	 I	 mentioned	 with	 άλλος	 [álos],	 this	 N	 (ν)	 is	 also	 optional.	 It’s	 kind	 of	
    archaic,	 and	 in	 some	 dialects	 and	 personal	 idiolects,	 falling	 out	 of	 use.	 So	 you	
    don’t	 have	 to	 put	 this	 N	 (ν)	 on.	 You	 may	 hear	 it	 with	 or	 without.	 Όλο/όλον	
    [ólo/ólon],	like	άλλος	 [álos]	 becoming	άλλο	 [álon]	or	άλλον	 [álon].	 You	can	hear	
    either.	I	have	seen	it?

T:	 “I	find”,	I	find,	in	Greek	is	βρίσκω	[vrísko].	Βρίσκω.		
	
S:	 Βρίσκω.		
	
T:	 I	can’t	find	it.	So,	you	don’t	need	to	say	“can’t”,	really.	A	lot	of	the	time,	in	Greek,	
    you	know,	we	don’t	translate	the	“can”	that	we	use	in	English.	You	can	just	say,	
    for	 example,	 “I	 don’t	 find	 it”.	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be?	 Βρίσκω	 [vrísko]	 is	 “I	 find”	
    and,	I	don’t	find	it,	or,	I	can’t	find	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	βρίσκω	[dhen	to	vrísko].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	βρίσκω.	I	don’t	find	them.	I	can’t	find	them.		
	
S:	 Δεν	τους	βρίσκω	[dhen	tus	vrísko].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 τους	 βρίσκω.	 So	 this	 would	 be	 masculine	 things,	 or	 people	 of	 masculine	 or	
    mixed	 gender.	 Δεν	 τους	 βρίσκω.	 What	 if	 you	 meant	 neuter	 things,	 or	 things	 of	
    mixed	gender?		
	
S:	 Δεν	τα	βρίσκω	[dhen	ta	vrísko].		
	
T:	 	Δεν	τα	βρίσκω.	Very	good.	And	feminine	things,	or	just	females.	I	don’t	find	them.		
	
S:	 Δεν	τις	βρίσκω	[dhen	tis	vrísko].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 τις	 βρίσκω.	 The	 closed	 version	 of	 βρίσκω	 [vrísko],	 is	 βρω	 [vro].	
    Very	strange,	βρω,	like	V	(β)	[v]	–	R	(ρ)	[r]	–	O	(ω)	[o].		
	
S:	 Βρω.		
	
T:	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 can’t	 find	 it,	 literally,	 using	 the	 verb,	 “I	 can’t”.	 I	 can,	 I	
    can’t.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	το	βρω	[dhen	boró	na	to	vro].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορώ	να	το	βρω.	Have	you	found	it?		
	
S:	 Το	έχεις	βρει;	[to	échis	vri?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	έχεις	βρει;	The	past	of	βρίσκω	[vrísko]	is	quite	strange.	It’s	βρήκα	
    [vríka].	Bρήκα.		
	
	S:	Bρήκα.		
	
T:	 Ι	didn’t	find	them.	And	we	mean	neuter	or	mixed	things.	I	didn’t	find	them.		


                                                                                                     319
	
S:	 Δεν	τα	βρήκα	[dhen	ta	vríka].		
	
T:	 Δεν	τα	βρήκα.	Good.	Did	you	find	them?		
	
S:	 Τα	βρήκες;	[ta	vríkes?].		
	
T:	 Τα	βρήκες;	Good.	Τα	βρήκες;	So,	you	know,	when	you	come	across	one	irregular	
    version	of	a	verb	like,	βρήκα	[vríka],	you	don’t	need	to	look	at	them	all.	You	know	
    what	will	happen	after	that.	Βρήκες.	Good.	We	didn’t	find	them.		
	
S:	 Δεν	τα	βρήκαμε	[dhen	ta	vríkame].		
	
T:	 Δεν	τα	βρήκαμε.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	We	didn’t	find	them	for	them?	So,	we	
    mean	 people,	 no,	 when	 we	 say	 “for	 them”,	 and	 with	 those	 first	 “them”	 –	 We	
    didn’t	find	them,	still	with	the	neuter	plural.	So,	We	didn’t	find	them	for	them.	We	
    didn’t	find	them,	them.		
	
S:	 Δεν	τους	τα	βρήκαμε	[dhen	tus	ta	vríkame].		
	
T:	 Δεν	τους	τα	βρήκαμε.	Very	good.		So	 we	 have	 the	 personal	 one	 first,	 no,	 the	 one	
    referring	 to	 the	 person	 or	 persons	 first,	 “τους”	 [tus],	 and	 then	 the	 things,	 “τα	
    βρήκαμε”	 [ta	 vríkame].	 So,	 βρήκα,	 βρήκε,	 βρήκες	 [vríkα,	 vríke,	 vríkes]	 is	 a	 bit	
    strange,	 no?	 And	 actually	 it’s	 where	 the	 old	 expression,	 “Eureka!”,	 in	 English,	
    comes	 from.	 “Eureka”,	 literally,	 “I	 found	 it”;	 it’s	 just	 from	 an	 older	 version	 of	
    Greek.	So	people	don’t	use	it	so	much	in	English,	anymore,	no,	but	they	used	to	
    say,	like,	“Eureka!”,	when	they	worked	something	out.	And	this	is	like,	“I	found	it!”	
    So,	βρήκα	is	irregular,	no?	But	not	in	Cyprus,	for	example.	In	Cyprus,	you	will	hear	
    “είβρα”	[ívra].	So	it	goes	into	the	past	like:	πω/είπα	[po/ípa];	δω/είδα	[dho/ídha];	
    βρω/είβρα	[vro/ívra].	But	otherwise,	βρήκα	[vríka].	Did	you	find	it?		
	
S:	 Το	βρήκες;	[to	vríkes?].		
	
T:	 Didn’t	you	find	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	βρήκες;	[dhen	to	vríkes?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	βρήκες;	What	was,	I	say,	or,	I	tell?		
	
S:	 Λέω	[léo].		
	
T:	 Λέω.	 Λέω	 is	 actually	 λέγω	 [légho].	 We	 mentioned	 this	 before,	 but	 the	 G	 (γ)	 got	
    swallowed	up	in	modern	Greek;	but	pops	up	again	in	other	verbs	that	come	from	
    λέω,	 like	 επιλέγω,	 διαλέγω	 [epilǵho,	 dhialégho],	 both	 of	 which	 mean,	 like,	
    “choose”	or	“decide”.	So	this	G	(γ),	which	is	hidden	in	λέω	[léo],	will	pop	up	again	
    in	the	open	past	–	that	ongoing	past	that	we	create	from	the	standard	verb	form,	
    λέω.	So,	“I	was	saying”	is	έλεγα	[élegha].	Έλεγα.		


                                                                                              320
	
S:	 Έλεγα.		
	
T:	 So	we	have	an	[e]	(ε)	at	the	beginning	to	make	it	longer;	but	also	this	G	(γ)	pops	
    up	again.	Έλεγα.		
	
S:	 Έλεγα.		
	
T:	 You	were	saying.		
	
S:	 Έλεγες	[éleghes].		
	
T:	 Έλεγες	 [éleyes].	 So	 here	 the	 G	 (γ)	 [gh]	 is	 softened	 by	 the	 [e]	 sound	 that	 comes	
    after	 it;	 the	 γάμα	 [gháma]	 (Γ/γ)	 is	 softened	 to	 more	 like	 a	 Υ	 sound	 [y].	 Έλεγες	
    [éleyes].		
	
S:	 Έλεγες	[éleyes].		
	
T:	 What	were	you	saying?		
	
S:	 Τι	έλεγες;	[ti	éleyes?].		
	
T:	 Τι	έλεγες;	What	would	you	say?		
	
S:	 Τι	θα	έλεγες;	[ti	tha	éleyes?].		
	
T:	 Τι	θα	έλεγες;	What	would	you	tell	her?		
	
S:	 Τι	θα	της	έλεγες;	[ti	tha	tis	éleyes?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τι	θα	της	έλεγες;	Tι	θα	της	έλεγες;	What	did	you	say?		
	
S:	 Τι	έλεγες;	[ti	éleyes?].		
	
T:	 This	 is	 more	 like	 “What	 were	 you	 saying?”,	 no?	 What	 did	 you	 say?	 What	 is	 the	
    closed	version	of,	λέω	[léo]?		
	
S:	 Πω	[po].	Τι	...	τι	είπες;	[ti	ípes?].		
	
T:	 Τι	είπες;	Τι	είπες;	What	was,	I	eat?		
	
S:	 Τρώω.		
	
T:	 	Τρώω.	And	the	closed	version	of,	τρώω?		
	
S:	 Φάω	[fáo].		
	


                                                                                              321
T:	 Φάω.	 Good.	 These	 also	 have	 a	 G	 (γ)	 hidden	 away,	 both	 …	 both	 versions.	 “I	 was	
    eating”,	is	έτρωγα	[étrogha].	Έτρωγα.		
	
S:	 Έτρωγα.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	would	eat?		
	
S:	 Θα	έτρωγα	[tha	étrogha].		
	
T:	 Θα	έτρωγα.	Good.	So,	maybe	somebody	says	to	you,	“Αre	you	hungry?”,	which	is	
    a	 verb	 in	 Greek,	 πεινάς;	 [pinás?].	 “Are	 you	 hungry?”	 –	 Πεινάς;	 Θα	 έτρωγα	 [tha	
    étrogha]	–	“I	would	eat,	I	could	eat”.	We	were	eating?		
	
S:	 Τρώγαμε	[tróghame].		
	
T:	 Τρώγαμε.	 Νο?	 So	 we	 don’t	 need	 the	 [e]	 (ε)	 at	 the	 beginning	 any	 more.	 We	 are	
    adding	two	syllables	with	“-αμε”	[ame].	Τρώγαμε.	We	would	eat.		
	
S:	 Θα	τρώγαμε	[tha	tróghame].		
	
T:	 Θα	τρώγαμε.	“I	ate”,	is	έφαγα	[éfagha].	So	again	we	have	the	G	(γ)	popping	up;	a	
    G	(γ)	that’s	hidden	in	φάω	[fáo]	pops	up	with	έφαγα	[éfagha]	–	“I	ate”.		
	
S:	 Έφαγα.		
	
T:	 We	ate?		
	
S:	 Φάγαμε	[fághame].		
	
T:	 Φάγαμε.	They	ate?		
	
S:	 Φάγανε	[fághane].		
	
T:	 Φάγανε,	or	...	?		
	
S:	 Έφαγαν	[éfaghan].		
	
T:	 Έφαγαν.	Φάγανε	[fághane]	or	έφαγαν	[éfaghan].	They	were	eating.

T:	 Τρώγανε,	or	...	?

Teacher:	“I	think”,	like,	“I	believe”,	you	know	like,	“I	think	that”,	“I	believe	that”,	is	
    νομίζω	[nomízo].	Νομίζω.		
	
Student:	Νομίζω.		
	
T:	 We	 saw	 ότι	 [óti],	 which	 meant	 “that”,	 no,	 and	 also	 που	 [pu],	 which	 could	 mean	
    “that”,	other	than	“where”	(πού	[pu]),	no?	And	we	were	using	“που”	in	sentences	
    like,	“The	only	thing	that	I	want”	–	Το	μόνο	που	θέλω	[to	móno	pu	thélo];	so	like	
    “which”.	When	you	say,	“I	think	that”,	will	you	use	“νομίζω	ότι”	[nomízo	óti]	or,	
    “νομίζω	που”	[nomízo	pu]?		
	
S:	 I	would	say,	Nομίζω	ότι	[nomízo	óti].		
	
T:	 Why?	Why	not	“που”	[pu]?		
	
S:	 It’s	more	like	related	to	a	person,	I	think.		
	
T:	 So,	 you	 know,	 we	 compare	 to	 English,	 no?	 So	 it’s	 more	 like	 “which”:	 “a	 thing	
    which”,	 “a	 thing	 that”,	 no?	 So	 this	 is	 not	 like,	 “I	 believe	 which	 ...	 ”.	 No?	 It’s,	 “I	
    believe	that”,	so	we	have,	ότι.	So	we	say,	you	know,	“I	think	that”,	“I	believe	that”,	
    “He	 told	 me	 that”,	 etc.;	 we	 have	 “ότι”	 [óti].	 When	 “that”	 is	 like	 “which”:	 “The	
    thing	that	…	”,	“The	thing	which	he	told	me”,	then	we	use	“που”	[pu].	I	think	they	
    ate	already?		
	
S:	 Νομίζω	ότι	φάγανε	ήδη	[nomízo	óti	fághane	ídhi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Νομίζω	ότι	φάγανε	ήδη.	Νομίζω	ότι	έφαγαν	ήδη	[nomízo	óti	éfaghan	
    ídhi].	So,	often	in	English	we	can	leave	the	“that”	out;	we	can	leave	it	out,	no?	“I	
    think	they	ate	already”	–	“I	think	that	they	ate	already”.	In	Greek,	we’ll	include	it.	
    Νομίζω	ότι	[nomízo	óti].		
	
	 “Before”,	before,	is	πριν	[prin].	Πριν.		
	
S:	 Πριν.

	S:	Yes.		
	
T:	 An	S	(σ)	is	the	closed	form.	Good.		
	
S:	 Yes.		
	
T:	 OK.	So,	I	thought	that	they	had	eaten	already.		
	
S:	 Νόμισα	ότι	φάγανε	ήδη	[nómisa	óti	fághane	ídhi].		
	
T:	 They	had	eaten	already.	So,	not	even	“they	have”.	We	want	“had”	now.		
	
S:	 Είχανε	φάγει	ήδη	[íkhane	fái	ídhi].	
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Νόμισα	 –	 so	 you	 used	 the	 closed	 version	 –	 Νόμισα	 ότι	 είχανε	 φάγει	
    ήδη	 [nómisa	 óti	 íkhane	 fái	 ídhi].	 And	 this	 is	 possible,	 but	 much	 more	 common	
    would	 be	 “νόμιζα”	 [nómiza],	 using	 the	 open	 past,	 the	 standard	 version	 of	 the	
    verb.	 Νόμιζα	 ότι	 είχανε	 φάγει	 ήδη	 [nómisa	 óti	 íkhane	 fái	 ídhi],	 or,	 είχανε	 ήδη	
    φάγει	[íkhane	ídhi	fái].	Can	you	tell	me	why,	why	we	might	use,	νόμιζα	[nómiza],	
    rather	than	the	closed,	νόμισα	[nómisa]?		
	
S:	 Well,	 I	 was	 thinking	 it’s	 more	 like	 an	 ongoing	 process:	 I	 was	 in	 the	 belief,	 you	
    know.		
	
T:	 Yes.	 It’s	 like	 an	 open,	 ongoing	 thing,	 no?	 So,	 you	 know,	 when	 we	 notice	 that	
    natives	 use	 something	 different	 to	 what	 we	 might	 use,	 because,	 maybe	 more	
    naturally,	 “I	 thought”,	 we	 would	 go	 to	 “νόμισα”,	 if	 we	 don’t	 really	 stop	 to	 think	
    about	 what	 that	 “I	 thought”	 means,	 no?	 Whether	 we	 refer	 to	 something	 closed	
    and	 concrete,	 or	 open	 and	 ongoing,	 when	 we	 say,	 “I	 believed”,	 “I	 thought”.	 So,	
    whilst	 we	 say,	 “I	 thought”,	 in	 English,	 and	 we	 use	 the	 closed	 verb,	 it’s	 actually	
    more	like,	“I	was	of	the	belief”,	no?	The	meaning	is	not	something	that’s	closed	
    and	defined	in	that	way;	it’s	something	open,	you	know	–	“I	believed	that”.	But	it	
    does	 depend	 on	 the	 context.	 You	 could	 hear	 either.	 But	 much	 more	 common,	 I	
    would	say,	is	νόμιζα	[nómiza],	the	standard	form,	for	“I	thought	/	I	believed	that”.		
	
	 So	 we	 saw	 αφήνω	 [afíno]	 for	 “I	 leave”,	 like,	 “I	 leave	 something”,	 or	 “I	 leave	
    someone”.	“I	leave”,	in	the	sense	of,	“I	am	leaving”,	no,	“I	am	going	out”,	is	φεύγω	
    [févgho].	Φεύγω.

    Φεύγω,	“I	leave”.		
	
S:	 Φεύγω.		
	
T:	 Φεύγω,	which	is	spelt	with	the	F	(φ/Φ),	the	letter	for	F,	which	is	like	a	circle	with	a

    EU	(ευ),	giving	us	[ev];	γάμα	[gháma]	(γ);	and	then	the	ωμέγα	[omégha]	(ω),	that	
    we	have	finishing	the	verbs	for	“I”.	Φεύγω	[févgho].

S:	 Θα	έφευγα	[tha	éfevgha].		
	
T:	 Θα	έφευγα.	The	closed	version	of	φεύγω	[févgho],	is	φύγω	[fígho].	Φύγω.		
	
S:	 Φύγω.	
	
T:	 So	it’s	a	little	bit	irregular,	no?	Φύγω.

T:	 I	wanted	to	leave.		
	
S:	 Ήθελα	να	φύγω	[íthela	na	fígho].

    φεύγει	[févyi]?		
	
S:	 Well,	it	doesn’t	take	long	to	leave.	Right?	It’s	about	the	…	the	act.		
	
T:	 It’s	not	about	the	amount	of	time,	though.		
	
S:	 Well,	 it’s	 a,	 it’s	 a	 moment	 in	 time,	 though.	 Isn’t	 it?	 It’s	 about	 the,	 this	 closed

                                                                                                326
T:	 Yes,	much	more	about	that,	no?	About	like	how	you	are	referring	to	the	time,	no?	
    It	could	be	something	that	took	a	long	time,	and	it	could	still	be	closed.	So,	when	
    we	say	“I	wanted”,	that	“I	wanted”	is	kind	of	ongoing;	but	the	“to	leave”	isn’t.	It	
    just	refers	to,	like,	an	act	of	leaving,	of	leaving	once,	no?	I	would	like	him	to	leave.

T:	 Good.	 Θα	 ήθελα	 να	 φύγει.	 And	 we	 have	 the	 γάμα	 [gháma]	 (γ)	 softened	 again	
    there.	 Θα	 ήθελα	 να	 φυγει	 [tha	 íthela	 na	 fíyi].	 So	 we	 could	 use,	 Θα	 ήθελα	 [tha	
    íthela],	for	“I	would	like”,	no?	We’ve	said,	“I	would	want”,	literally.	He	is	leaving?		
	
S:	 Φεύγει	[févyi].		
	
T:	 Φεύγει.	Good.	Good	for	softening	the	γάμα	[gháma]	(γ).	Φεύγει	[févyi].	Are	you	
    leaving?		
	
S:	 Φεύγεις;	[févyis?].		
	
T:	 Φεύγεις;	I	left.		
	
S:	 Έφυγα	[éfigha].		
	
T:	 Έφυγα.	 Very	 good.	 And	 this	 is	 also	 a	 way	 of	 saying	 goodbye	 in	 Greek,	 like,	 “I’m	
    off”.	Έφυγα	–	I’m	off.	Like,	I	left;	I’ve	disappeared;	Ciao.	I	have	left?		
	
S:	 Έχω	φύγει	[ékho	fíyi].		
	
T:	 Έχω	φύγει.	Ι	had	left?		
	
S:	 Είχα	φύγει	[íkha	fíyi].

S:	 Πριν	[prin].		
	
T:	 Πριν.	I	would	have	left	before	...	?		
	
S:	 Θα	είχα	φύγει	πριν	[tha	íkha	fíyi	prin].

S:	 Αλλά	[alá].		
	
T:	 Αλλά	 ...	 I	 had	 to	 stay.	 What	 is,	 I	 had?	 What	 is	 “I	 had”	 doing	 here?	 What	 does	 it	
    mean,	I	had	to	stay?		
	
S:	 In	Greek	it	would	be,	It	was	necessary	that	I	stay.		
	
T:	 So	this	is,	“had	to	stay”,	in	the	meaning	of	“must”,	no,	“should”,	rather	than,	“had	
    stayed”.	No?	So	we	focus	on	the	meaning,	rather	than	the	words,	to	not	get,	έχω	
    and	είχα	[ékho,	íkha],	and	πρέπει	and	έπρεπε	[prépi,	éprepe]	all	mixed	up.	So,	I	
    had	to	stay.		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	μείνω	[éprepe	na	míno].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.	Θα	είχα	φύγει	πριν	[tha	íkha	fíyi	prin]	–	I	would	have	left	
    before,	αλλά	έπρεπε	να	μείνω	[alá	éprepe	na	míno]	–	but	I	had	to	stay.	So,	έπρεπε	
    [éprepe],	 I	 had	 to,	 can	 refer	 to	 something	 open	 or	 closed,	 no,	 an	 ongoing	
    obligation,	or	whatever.	But,	μείνω	[míno]	means	once,	you	know.	I	had	to	stay	on	
    this	occasion	that	I	am	talking	about.	So	μείνω	[míno],	rather	than	the	standard,	
    open,	μένω[méno].	I	had	to	leave.		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	φύγω	[éprepe	na	fígho].		
	
T:	 Έπρεπε	να	φύγω.	I	had	left	already.		
	
S:	 Είχα	φύγει	ήδη	[íkha	fíyi	ídhi].		
	
T:	 Είχα	φύγει	ήδη.	Good.	Είχα	φύγει	ήδη.	I	should	leave.	How	did	we	get	“should”?		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	φύγει	[éprepe	na	fíyi].		
	
T:	 So	deal	with,	I	should,	first.	How	did	we	get,	I	should,	for,	It	would	be	necessary?		
	
S:	 Θα	έπρεπε	[tha	éprepe].		
	
T:	 Θα	έπρεπε.	Νο?	So,	Θα	έπρεπε	[tha	éprepe]	gives	us	the	meaning	of	“should”.	So,	
    I	should	leave?		
	
S:	 Θα	έπρεπε	να	φύγω	[tha	éprepe	na	fígho].		
	
T:	 Θα	έπρεπε	να	φύγω.	Very	good.	If	you	want	to	say,	I	should	have	left,	you	can	say,	
    It	would	be	necessary	I	had	left.	I	had	left.		
	
S:	 Θα	έπρεπε	να	είχα	φύγει	[tha	éprepe	na	íkha	fíyi].

S:	 Πάρω	[páro].		
	
T:	 Πάρω.	 The	 past	 of	 πάρω,	 no,	 so	 the	 closed	 past,	 just,	 “I	 took”,	 is	 πήρα	 [píra].	
    Πήρα.		
	
S:	 Πήρα.		
	
T:	 So	that’s	quite	irregular,	no,	but	not,	“I	was	taking”.	“I	was	taking”	is	regular.	So,	
    how	is,	I	was	taking,	rather	than,	I	took?		
	
S:	 Έπαιρνα	[éperna].		
	
T:	 Έπαιρνα.	No?	Going	from	παίρνω	[pérno].	Βut	going	from	πάρω	[páro],	it’s	quite	
    irregular.	We	have,	πήρα	[píra].		
	
S:	 Πήρα.		
	
T:	 But	having	one	of	these	irregular	versions,	we	can	find	the	others.	So,	We	took?

S:	 Τι	πήρες;	[ti	píres?].		
	
T:	 Τι	πήρες;	And	this	can	also	be	used	like,	“to	buy”.	Τι	πήρες;	–	What	did	you	buy?	
    What	did	you	take?		
	
	 The	word	for	“when”	was	πότε	[póte],	Πότε.		
	
S:	 Πότε.

	 What	was	the	word	for	“when”,	when	“when”	isn’t	a	question?	No?	So	when	we

S:	 Όταν	[ótan].		
	
T:	 Όταν.	I	was	leaving	when	he	called	me,	when	she	called	me.	I	was	leaving	when	he	
    took	me	’phone.		
	
S:	 Έφευγα	όταν	με	πήρε	τηλέφωνο	[éfevgha	ótan	me	píre	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έφευγα	όταν	με	πήρε	τηλέφωνο.	So,	we	are	using	both	types	of	past	
    there,	no?	Έφευγα	[éfevgha]	–	I	was	leaving,	the	open	past;	and	then	the	closed	
    one,	όταν	με	πήρε	τηλέφωνο	[ótan	me	píre	tiléfono]	–	when	he	called	me.		
	
	 What	was,	I	think,	like,	I	believe?	I	think	that	...	?		
	
S:	 Νομίζω	[nomízo].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Νομίζω,	 νομίζω	 ότι	 [nomízo	 óti]	 –	 I	 think	 that.	 I	 think	 that	 I	 was	 leaving	
    when	he	called	me.	I	think	that	I	was	leaving	when	he	called	me.		
	
S:	 Νομίζω	ότι	έφευγα	[nomízo	óti	éfevgha]	...		
	
T:	 When	he	called	me.		
	
S:	 Όταν	με	πήρε	τηλέφωνο	[ótan	me	píre	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Νομίζω	ότι	έφευγα	όταν	με	πήρε	τηλέφωνο	[nomízo	óti	éfevgha	ótan	
    me	píre	tiléfono].	And	other	than	ότι	[óti]	with	νομίζω	[nomízo],	you	can	hear	πώς	
    [pos]	–	“how”.	Πώς.	Νομίζω	πώς	[nomízo	pos].	Especially	in	the	spoken	language.		
	
	 “I	arrive”	is	φτάνω	[ftáno].	Φτάνω.		
	
S:	 Φτάνω.		
	
T:	 Or	 maybe	 more	 literally,	 “to	 reach”.	 Φτάνω.	 And	 you	 can	 also	 hear,	 φτάνει/	
    φθάνει	[ftáni/ftháni],	the	expression	“φθάνει”	–	like	enough,	that’s	enough.	So	we	
    could	also	translate	this	verb	like,	“to	be	enough”	–	“to	reach”,	in	that	sense.	But	
    very	 commonly	 used	 like,	 “to	 arrive”	 –	 φτάνω	 [ftáno].	 I	 was	 arriving	 when	 they

S:	 The	closed.

Complete	Greek,	Track	72	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	 We	 also	 have	 a	 plural	 “you”	 in	 Greek,	 so	 like,	 “you	 all”,	 to	 address	 more	
    than	one	person	at	the	same	time.	The	ending	for	this	is	“ετε”	[ete]	in	the	present,	
    and	“ατε”	[ate]	in	the	past.	So	how	would	you	say,	You	guys	want?		
	
Student:	Θέλετε	[thélete].		
	
T:	 Θέλετε.	Good.	What	do	you	want?		
	
S:	 Τι	θέλετε;	[ti	thélete?].		
	
T:	 Τι	θέλετε;	If	you	want.	What	was	the	word	for	“if”?		
	
S:	 Αν	[an].		
	
T:	 Αν.	If	you	want.		
	
S:	 Αν	θέλετε	[an	thélete].		
	
T:	 Αν	θέλετε.	What	was	the	word	for,	you?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	[esí].		
	
T:	 Εσύ.	The,	the	word	for	plural	“you”,	no,	“you	guys”,	is	εσείς	[esís].		
	
S:	 Εσείς.		
	
T:	 So	to	the	ear,	it’s	just	the	plural	of	“εσύ”	[esí],	but	in	spelling	they	change	quite	a	
    lot.	Εσύ	is	spelt	Ε	(ε),	S	(σ),	U	(υ);	the	U	(υ)	by	itself	gives	us	an	[i]	sound;	and	εσείς	
    [esís]	is	spelt	E	(ε),	S	(σ),	E	(ε),	I	(ι),	S	(ς),	and	there	our	[i]	sound	is	made	combining	
    E	(ε)	and	I	(ι).	So	they	are	written	quite	different,	εσύ	[esí]	and	εσείς	[esís],	but	to	
    the	ear,	εσείς	is	just	the	plural,	no?	So,	using	the	word	for	“you”,	how	would	you	
    say,	Do	you	guys	want?		
	
S:	 Εσείς	θέλετε;	[esís	thélete?].		
	
T:	 Εσείς	θέλετε;	How	did	we	say,	Υou	are?	Εσύ	[esí]	...	?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	[íse].		
	
T:	 Εσύ	είσαι	[esí	íse].	Good.	“You	guys	are”	is,	εσείς	είστε	[esís	íste].	Eσείς	είστε.		
	
	S:	Eσείς	είστε.		
	
T:	 So	we	have	“είστε”	[íste],	for,	You	guys	are.	Are	you	guys	tired?		
	


                                                                                             333

T:	 Είστε	κουρασμένοι;	Or	what	if	you	were	talking	to	females?		
	
S:	 Είστε	κουρασμένες;	[íste	kurazménes?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Είστε	 κουρασμένες;	 So,	 we	 have	 “ετε”	 [ete]	 for	 you,	 plural,	 in	 the	
    present	and	“ατε”	[ate]	in	the	past.	 Of	course,	“είστε”	 [íste]	is	irregular.	So,	You	
    guys	want,	was	...	?		
	
S:	 Εσείς	θέλετε	[esís	thélete].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλετε	[thélete].	And,	Did	you	want,	instead	of	“ετε”	[ete],	we	are	going	to	
    use	“ατε”	[ate].		
	
S:	 Θέλατε;	[thélate?].		
	
T:	 Θέλατε;	 So	 again,	 we	 are	 not	 adding	 any	 syllables	 onto	 the	 beginning,	 no?	 We	
    don’t	 need	 them;	 “ατε”	 has	 two	 syllables.	 Θέλατε.	 So,	 “θέλετε”	 [thélete]	 and	
    “θέλατε”	[thélate]	sound	very	similar.	What	do	you	guys	want?		
	
S:	 Τι	θέλετε;	[ti	thélete?].		
	
T:	 Τι	θέλετε;	What	did	you	guys	want?

T:	 Τι	θέλατε;	Didn’t	you	guys	want	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	θέλατε;	[dhen	to	thélate?].

S:	 Πότε	φεύγα	...	Πότε	φύγατε;	[póte	févgha	…	póte	fíghate?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πότε	φύγατε;	So	with	“ατε”	[ate],	no,	and	our	other	past	endings	with	
    two	 syllables,	 we	 don’t	 need	 to	 worry	 about	 adding	 any	 sounds	 onto	 the	
    beginning.	Πότε	φύγατε;	To	arrive.	I	arrive.	How	was,	I	arrive?		
	


                                                                                          334

T:	 Έφτασα.	When?	...	And	this	isn’t	a	question.		
	
S:	 Όταν	[ótan].		
	
T:	 Όταν	...	You	all	were	leaving.		
	
S:	 Φεύγατε	[févgate].		
	
T:	 Έφτασα	 όταν	 φεύγατε	 [éftasa	 ótan	 févgate].	 “Έφτασα”	 –	 that’s	 closed,	 no?	 We	
    use	 the	 closed	 version.	 When	 you	 all	 were	 leaving	 –	 that’s	 open:	 όταν	 φεύγατε		
    [ótan	févgate].		
	
	 What	was,	I	have?		
	
S:	 Έχω	[ékho].		
	
T:	 Έχω.	How	would,	You	guys	have,	be?

T:	 Έχετε.	Have	you	guys	arrived	already?		
	
S:	 Έχετε	φτάνει	ήδη;	[échete	ftáni	ídhi?].		
	
T:	 Φτάνει	[ftáni]?	Φτάνω	is	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Έχετε	φτάσει	ήδη;	[échete	ftási	ídhi?].		
	
T:	 Έχετε	 φτάσει	 ήδη;	 Good.	 So	 we	 always	 use	 the	 closed	 form	 of	 the	 verb	 to	 build	
    this	 “have”	 past.	 Έχετε	 φτάσει	 ήδη;	 So,	 we	 have	 “έχετε”	 [échete]	 for,	 Υou	 have,	
    and	what	might	we	have	for,	Υou	had?		
	
S:	 Είχατε	[íkhate].		
	
T:	 Είχατε.	Very	good.	Just	like	“είχα”	[íkha],	no?	“I	had”.	Είχατε.	How	would	you	say,	
    But	you	had	arrived	already?	But,	you	guys,	had	arrived	already.		
	
S:	 Αλλά	είχατε	φτάσει	ήδη	[alá	íkhate	ftási	ídhi].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αλλά	είχατε	φτάσει	ήδη.	Or,	more	commonly,	Αλλά	είχατε	ήδη	φτάσει	[alá	
    íkhate	 ídhi	 ftási].	 Or,	 maybe	 more	 common	 than	 “αλλά”	 [alá]	 here,	 especially	


                                                                                           335
   when	 it’s	 kind	 of	 exclamatory:	 “But	 you	 had	 arrived	 already!”.	 Maybe	 with	 your

    course	 a	 lot	 of	 your	 word	 order	 choices	 are	 going	 to	 come	 from	 how	 you’re	
    working	 through	 it	 in	 English.	 So	 you	 must	 always	 keep	 an	 ear	 open	 to	 how	
    natives	might	use	a	different	order,	and	then	you	can	adjust	your	speech	to	sound	
    more	 native	 and	 more	 natural	 –	 but	 also,	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 not	 giving	 up	 that	
    flexibility	that	Greek	has	to	emphasise	different	things,	in	different	situations.		
	
	 The	word	for,	if?		
	
S:	 Αν	[an].		
	
T:	 Αν.	If	you	guys	had	taken	the	other	road	you	would	have	already	arrived.	So,	what	
    was,	road,	like,	aerodrome,	hippodrome.		
	
S:	 Δρόμος	[dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Like	 syndrome,	 my	 favourite.	 Δρόμος.	 If	 you	 had	 taken;	 If	 you	 guys	 had	 taken.	
    Let’s	start	there.		
	
S:	 Αν	θα	είχατε	πάρει	[an	tha	íkhate	pári].		
	
T:	 That’s,	“If	you	would	have	taken”.	So,	work	through	the	English.	If	you	had	taken.	
    it’s	quite	literal.	If	...	?		
	
S:	 Αν	[an].		
	
T:	 You	had,	plural.		
	
S:	 Αν	είχατε	[an	íkhate].		
	
T:	 Taken.		
	
S:	 Πάρει	[pári].		
	
T:	 The	other	road.		
	
S:	 Tον	άλλον	δρόμο	[ton	álon	dhrómo].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αν	είχατε	πάρει	τον	άλλον	δρόμο	[an	íkhate	pári	ton	álon	dhrómo].	So,	
    άλλον,	άλλος	[álon,	álos],	no,	behaves	likes	“τον”	[ton]:	τον	άλλον	δρόμο	[ton	álon	
    dhrómo].	And,	δρόμος	[dhrómos]	just	acts	like	a	masculine	noun,	losing	its	S	(ς).	
    Αν	 είχατε	 πάρει	 τον	 άλλον	 δρόμο.	 You	 would	 have	 arrived	 already.	 So	 here	 you	




                                                                                            336
   have,	 “would	 have”,	 not	 before.	 You	 guys	 would	 have	 arrived	 already,	 already	
   arrived.		
	
S:	 Θα	είχατε	φτάσει	ήδη	[tha	íkhate	ftási	ídhi].		
	
T:	 Αν	είχατε	πάρει	τον	άλλον	δρόμο	θα	είχατε	φτάσει	ήδη	[an	íkhate	pári	ton	álon	
    dhrómo	tha	íkhate	ftási	ídhi].	Or,	maybe	a	bit	better,	θα	είχατε	ήδη	φτάσει	[tha	
    íkhate	 ídhi	 ftási].	 But	 when	 I	 say	 maybe	 a	 bit	 better,	 I	 mean	 just	 more	 neutral.	
    Maybe	you	want	to	stress	that	“ήδη”	[ídhi],	no,	and	maybe	you	want	to	say,	θα	
    είχατε	φτάσει	ήδη.	So	this	is	what	I	mean	about	just	listening	around	to	the	word	
    orders.	And	when	you	notice	a	lot	of	people	putting	things	in	a	way	that	would	be	
    different	to	how	you	would	say	it,	then	you	can	think	about	why.	And	this	is	how	
    we	really	fine-tune	our	language	to	a	native	level.		
	
	 So	we	had,	λέω	[léo]	for,	“I	say”,	or	“I	tell”.	How	would	it	be	for,	You	say,	You	tell?	
    In	the	plural,	You	guys.		
	
S:	 Λέτε	[léte].		
	
T:	 Λέτε.	What	are	you	guys	saying?	What	do	you	say?		
	
S:	 Τι	λέτε;	[ti	léte?].		
	
T:	 Τι	λέτε;	And	you	might	use	this	like,	“Hey,	what	do	you	think	...	about	this	plan?”	
    “Shall	we	go	there?”	Τι	λέτε;	What	did	you	guys	say?	So,	not	“What	were	you	guys	
    saying?”	Now	we	want	the	closed	form,	What	did	you	guys	say?		
	
S:	 Τι	είπατε;	[ti	ípate?].		
	
T:	 Τι	είπατε;	Τι	είπατε;	Very	good.	What	are	you	guys	eating?	So,	it’s	irregular,	no?	
    We	 have,	 “τρώω,	 τρως”	 [tróo,	 tros].	 What	 might	 we	 have	 for,	 You	 guys?	 The	
    ending	will	get	swallowed	up	a	little	bit,	just	like	“τρως,	τρώμε”	[tros,	tróme].		
	
S:	 Τι	τρώτε;	[ti	tróte?].		
	
T:	 Τι	τρώτε;		
	
S:	 Τι	τρώτε;		
	
T:	 Τι	τρώτε;	What	did	you	guys	eat?	So	not,	“What	were	you	eating?”.	But,	What	did	
    you	eat?		
	
S:	 Τι	φάγατε;	[ti	fághate?].		
	
T:	 Τι	φάγατε;	Very	good.	We	have	the	G	(γ)	popping	up	there	in	the	past.	Τι	φάγατε;

T:	 Είστε.	 Eσείς	 είστε	 [esís	 íste].	 And	 we	 can	 also	 have	 είσαστε	 [ísaste],	 instead	 of	
    είστε	[íste];	both	forms	exist	–	είστε	and	είσαστε.	And	for	the	past	of	those,	we

S:	 Δεν	ξέρω	πού	ήσασταν	[dhen	kséro	pu	ísastan].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 ξέρω	 πού	 ήσασταν.	 How	 should	 I	 know	 where	 you	 were?	 Rather	 than	 using	
    the	word	for,	πώς	[pos]	–	“how”,	it’s	like	an	expression	in	Greek.	You	say,	“where	
    ...	να”	[na]	–	πούνα	[púna].	How	should	I	know?	–	Πούνα	ξέρω;	[púna	kséro?].

    pu	ísastan?].	This	“you”,	plural,	which	we	are	seeing,	can	also	be	used	to	speak	for	
    one	person	formally,	like	“Sir”,	no,	“Madam”.	But	you	will	use	it	more	than	“Sir”	
    and	 “Madam”,	 for	 sure.	 Again,	 it	 depends	 on	 dialect	 and	 where	 you	 are,	 so	 you	
    might	want	to	listen	out	to	see	how	people	use	this	plural	“you”,	to	be	formal	to	
    one	 person.	 But	 if	 you	 address	 someone	 quite	 older	 than	 yourself,	 for	 example,	
    you	 might	 want	 to	 start	 with	 it.	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 What	 do	 you	 want?	 Be	
    informal.		
	
S:	 Τι	θέλετε;	[ti	thélete?].		
	
T:	 Τι	 θέλετε;	 So	 in	 English,	 to	 be	 more	 polite,	 we	 would	 say	 something	 like,	 you	
    know,	“What	was	it	that	you	wanted”,	or	whatever,	no?	But	in	Greek,	we	can	just	
    use	that	plural	“you”,	and	it	won’t	just	sound	like,	What	do	you	want?	It	will	sound	
    more	polite.	Τι	θέλετε;	What	did	you	want?		
	
S:	 Τι	θέλατε;	[ti	thélate?].		
	
T:	 Τι	θέλατε;

T:	 Good.	What	do	you	guys	think?		
	
S:	 Τι	νομίζετε;	[ti	nomízete?].		
	
T:	 Τι	νομίζετε;	What	did	you	guys	think?	You	can	also	use	this	like	an	expression,	like,	
    “What	did	you	think	would	happen?”	You	know,	like,	“What	did	you	expect?”		
	
S:	 Τι	νομίζατε;	[ti	nomízate?].		
	
T:	 Τι	νομίζατε;	Very	good.	And	you	stuck	with	the	open	form	of	the	verb.	What	were	
    you	 believing?	 Because,	 you	 know,	 the	 meaning	 of	 this	 verb	 lends	 itself	 much	
    more	to	that	idea	of	an	ongoing	time.	Τι	νομίζατε;	[ti	nomízate?].		
	
	 Give	me	again,	what	is,	You	are,	in	the	plural.	“Eσείς	[esís]	...	”	?		
	
S:	 Είστε	[íste].		
	
T:	 Eσείς	 είστε	 [esís	 íste].	 And	 you	 will	 hear,	 “Νά	 ’στε	 καλά”	 [ná’ste	 kalá],	 νά	 ’στε	
    καλά.	What	does	“νά	’στε”	[ná’ste]	mean?		
	
S:	 Να	είστε	[na	íste].		
	
T:	 Να	 είστε.	 Good.	 It’s	 “να	 είστε”,	 contracted,	 so,	 “Be	 well,	 you	 guys”,	 or	 to	 one	
    person	formally.	Or	informally,	“Νά	’σαι	καλά”	[ná’se	kalá],	νά	’σαι	καλά:	used	to

Complete	Greek,	Track	73	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	What	was,	I	can,	in	Greek?		
	
Student:	Μπορώ	[boró].		
	
T:	 Μπορώ.	 Good.	 And	 this	 verb	 has	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 end,	 no,	 as	 opposed	 to	 the	
    penultimate,	 the	 second	 last	 syllable,	 where	 it	 usually	 is,	 no,	 like	 θέλω	 [thélo],	
    αγοράζω	[aghorázo].	We	have	it	on	the	ending,	μπορώ.	And	we	saw	other	verbs	
    like	this.	We	had,	“I	try”,	meaning	something	like,	“towards	passion”.	“Towards”	is	
    προς	[pros]	and,	I	try	...	?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθώ	[prospathó].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθώ.	Good.		We	 had	 καλώ	 [kaló],	 which	 means	 like,	 “to	 call”,	 and	 “to	
    invite”.	Καλώ.		
	
S:	 Καλώ.	
	
T:	 We	had,	παρακαλώ	[parakaló],	which	meant	“please”.	Παρακαλώ,	σε	παρακαλώ	
    [se	 parakaló]	 –	 “please”.	 Also	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 end.	 We	 could	 have,	 αγαπώ	
    [aghapó]	or	αγαπάω	[aghapáo]	–	“I	love”;	also	with	the	accent	on	the	end.	Ζω	[zo]	
    –	“I	live”,	like	in	“zoo”;	like	in	the	name	in	English,	“Zoe”.	And	ζω	[zo]	also	counts	
    as	one	of	these	verbs,	with	the	accent	on	the	ending,	as	it’s	just	one	syllable.		
	
	 So	this	is	a	big	group	of	verbs,	actually.	There	are	a	lot	of	verbs	in	this	group,	that	
    have	 their	 accents	 on	 their	 endings,	 and	 this	 group	 also	 contains	 many	 very	
    common	and	useful	verbs.	And	it’s	a	very	useful	group	of	verbs,	or	to	see	these	
    verbs	as	a	group,	because	nearly	all	of	them	go	into	the	closed	version	in	exactly	
    the	same	way.		
	
	 Προσπαθώ	[prospathó]	–	“I	try”,	becomes,	προσπαθήσω	[prospathíso].		
	
S:	 Προσπαθήσω.		
	
T:	 	So	we	noted	briefly	before,	how	it’s	the	accented	syllable	that	changes,	no,	in	our	
    closed	form.	We	have,	αγοράζω	[aghorázo],	and	then	αγοράσω	[aghoráso].	So	it’s,	
    it’s	“ράζ”	[ráz]	that	is	taking	the	accent,	and	which	changes:	αγοράζω,	αγοράσω	
    [aghorázo,	aghoráso];	αλλάζω,	αλλάξω	[alázo,	alákso].		
	
	 But	 with	 this	 group	 of	 verbs,	 like	 μπορώ,	 προσπαθώ,	 αγαπώ	 [boró,	 prospathó,	
    aghapó],	 here	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 ending,	 so	 it’s	 the	 ending	 that	 has	 to	
    change.	 But	 it	 can’t,	 no;	 the	 ending	 can’t	 change.	 So,	 instead	 of	 changing	 the	
    ending	[o]	(ω),	which	is	showing	the	person,	we	insert	an	extra	syllable.	We	insert	
    [ís]	(ήσ):	προσπαθώ,	προσπαθήσω	[prospathó,	prospathíso];	and	there	we	get	the	
    closed	form.		
	


                                                                                              341
	 So,	αγαπώ	[aghapó]	–	“I	love”,	becomes,	in	its	closed	form	…	?		
	
S:	 Αγαπήσω	[aghapíso].		
	
T:	 Αγαπήσω.	Ζω	[zo],	ζω	–	“I	live”,	might	become	...	?		
	
S:	 Ζήσω	[zíso].		
	
T:	 Ζήσω.	You	might	hear,	Nα	ζήσεις	[na	zísis]	–	“long,	long	live	you”,	for	example,	on	
    a	 birthday	 or	 something.	 You	 might	 also	 hear,	 Nα	 σου	 ζήσει	 [na	 su	 zísi].	 Maybe	
    somebody	gets	a	new	dog,	and	people	wish,	Nα	σου	ζήσει	–	that	it	lives	for	you,	to	
    you	a	long	time.	How	would	you	say,	I	will	try?		
	
S:	 Θα	προσπαθώ	[tha	prospathó].		
	
T:	 That’s	more	like,	“I	will	be	trying”,	but	just,	I	will	try.		
	
S:	 Θα	προσπαθήσω	[tha	prospathíso].		
	
T:	 Θα	προσπαθήσω.	I	want	you	to	try.		
	
	S:	Θέλω	να	προσπαθήσεις	[thélo	na	prospathísis].		
	
T:	 I	want	you	to	try	–	Θέλω	να	προσπαθήσεις.	I	wanted	you	to	try.		
	
S:	 Ήθελα	να	προσπαθήσεις	[íthela	na	prospathísis].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Ήθελα	 να	 προσπαθήσεις.	 So	 we	 have,	 ήθελα	 [íthela]	 –	 “I	 wanted”,	 in	 the	
    past,	and	then	it’s,	“you	to	try”.	So	we,	we	don’t	need	to	go	into	the	past	again.	
    We	 just	 decide	 whether	 it’s	 open	 or	 closed.	 Ήθελα	 να	 προσπαθήσεις	 [íthela	 na	
    prospathísis].	I	want	you	guys	to	try.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	προσπαθήσετε	[thélo	na	prospathísete].

T:	 Έχω	προσπαθήσει.	I	had	tried.		
	
S:	 Είχα	προσπαθήσει	[íkha	prospathísi].

T:	 Very	good.	Θα	είχα	προσπαθήσει.	The	open	past	with	θα	[tha],	we	get	“would”.	
    And	of	course	with	είχα	[íkha],	we	just	have	one	past.	So,	Θα	είχα	προσπαθήσει	
    [tha	íkha	prospathísi]	–	I	would	have	tried.	And	of	course,	now	we	have	the	closed	
    form,	we	can	make	the	simple	past	as	well,	like,	“I	tried”,	“We	tried”,	etc.	So	how	
    is	that	–	I	tried?		
	
S:	 Προσπάθησα	[prospáthisa].		
	
T:	 Προσπάθησα.	We	tried.		
	
S:	 Προσπαθήσαμε	[prospathísame].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθήσαμε.	 Good.	 We	 are	 adding	 two	 syllables	 there	 with	 “αμε”	 [ame],	 so	
    the	 accent	 also	 moves	 forward	 one	 from	 προσπάθησα	 [prospáthisa].	
    Προσπάθησα,	προσπαθήσαμε.	They	tried?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθήσανε	[prospathísane].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Προσπαθήσανε.	 And	 we	 could	 also	 have,	 προσπάθησαν	 [prospáthisan].	
    You	guys	tried,	or	You	(formal)	tried.		
	
S:	 Προσπαθήσατε	[prospathísate].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθήσατε.	He	tried,	She	tried?		
	
S:	 Προσπάθησα	[prospáthisa].	Προσπάθησε	[prospáthise].		
	
T:	 Προσπάθησε	[prospáthise].	And,	Υou	(informal),	you	tried.	
	
S:	 Προσπάθησες	[prospáthises].		
	
T:	 Προσπάθησες.		
	
	 If	you	want	to	say	something	like,	“You	didn’t	even	try”,	You	didn’t	even	try,	you	
    can	say,	“ούτε	που”	[úte	pu].	So	ούτε	[úte]	is	something	like,	you	know,	“not,	not	
    even”	 –	 that,	 “που”	 [pu]	 –	 “you	 tried”.	 Oύτε	 που.	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be?	 You	
    didn’t	even	try.		
	
S:	 Oύτε	που	προσπάθησες	[úte	pu	prospáthises].		
	
T:	 Good.	Oύτε	που	προσπάθησες.	So	again	we	have	a	negative	here	in	English	–	You	
    didn’t	even	try	–	and	you	don’t	have	it	in	Greek.	Oύτε	που	προσπάθησες.	So	you	
    might	find	that	happening	sometimes	in	Greek,	no?	Not	having	a	negative	where	
    you	 might	 expect	 it.	 Just	 like	 the	 saying	 that	 we	 saw,	 “I	 haven’t	 done	 it	 in	 two	
    years”	 –	 Έχω	 δύο	 χρόνια	 να	 το	 κάνω	 [ékho	 dhío	 khrónia	 na	 to	 káno].	 We	 didn’t	
    have	 the	 negative	 there.	 So	 the	 same	 here:	 Oύτε	 που	 …	 [úte	 pu]	 –	 “You	 didn’t	
    even	…	”.	Oύτε	που	προσπάθησες	–	You	didn’t	even	try.		


                                                                                                343
	
	 Some	verbs,	as	we’ve	noted	with,	αγαπώ,	αγαπάω	[aghapó,	aghapáo]	–	“I	love”,	
    can	end	[o]	(ω),	or	[áo]	(άω);	μιλάω	[miláo]	or	μιλώ	[miló]	for	“I	speak”;	ρωτάω	
    [rotáo]	or	ρωτώ	[rotó]	for	“I	ask”.	So	with	some	of	these	verbs,	we	can	have	an	
    [áo]	(άω)	or	an	[o]	(ω)	ending.	But	you’ll	notice	that	both	forms	exist	with	some	of	
    these	verbs	with	their	accents	on	the	end.	So	when	you	come	across	an	[áo]	(άω)	
    verb,	you	will	also	find	it	with	[o]	(ω).	So	we	saw	for	example,	πουλάω	[puláo],	like	
    in	 “monopoly”,	 and	 we	 could	 also	 have	 πουλώ	 	 [puló],	 for	 “I	 sell”	 –	 πουλάω	 or	
    πουλώ.	 So	 we	 said	 we	 have	 μιλάω	 [miláo]	 or	 μιλώ	 [miló]	 for	 “I	 speak”.	 What	
    would	be	the	closed	version	of,	I	speak?	We’ll	replace	the	[áo]	(άω)	or	the	[o]	(ω)	
    with	ήσω	[íso].		
	
S:	 Μιλήσω	[milíso].		
	
T:	 Μιλήσω.	“Greek”,	in	Greek,	is	Eλληνικά	[eliniká].	Eλληνικά.		
	
S:	 Eλληνικά.		
	
T:	 Good.	This	is	a	plural,	neuter	word;	a	neuter,	plural	word.	So	it’s	something	 like	
    “the	 Hellenics”,	 no,	 Hellenics.	 And	 this	 is	 how	 Greek	 talks	 about	 languages.	 You	
    have	 for	 example,	 Eλληνικά	 –	 Greek;	 Αγγλικά	 [angliká]	 –	 no,	 English;	 or	
    Αγγλαίσικα	 [anglézika],	 we	 say	 in	 Cyprus	 for	 English.	 So	 it’s	 like,	 you	 know,	 “the	
    Englishes”,	in	neuter	plural;	the	Greeks,	the	Hellenics.	So	Eλληνικά	–	“Greek”.	How	
    would	you	say,	I	want	to	speak	Greek?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μιλήσω	Eλληνικά	[thélo	na	milíso	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 να	 μιλήσω	 Eλληνικά.	 So	 this	 would	 mean,	 like,	 now,	 no?	 Or	 some	
    closed	period	of	time,	some	event	or	something	that	you	are	referring	to.	If	you	
    wanted	to	say,	I	want	to	be	able	to	speak	Greek;	I	want	to	be	a	person	that	speaks	
    Greek;	then	you	could	use	the	open	form.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μιλάω	Eλληνικά	[thélo	na	miláo	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 να	 μιλάω	 Eλληνικά.	 Or,	 if	 you	 were	 to	 say,	 for	 example,	 “more	
    often”,	no,	then	you	could	use	that	form.	What	was	the	word	for,	more?		
	
S:	 Πιο	[pyo].		
	
T:	 Πιο.	And,	more	often?		
	
S:	 Πιο	συχνά	[pyo	sikhná].		
	
T:	 Πιο	 συχνά.	 And,	 ποιό	 [pió]	 also	 means	 “which”	 –	 ποιό.	 So,	 πιο	 συχνά	 –	 “more	
    often”.	I	want	to	speak	Greek	more	often.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μιλάω	Eλληνικά	πιο	συχνά	[thélo	na	miláo	eliniká	pyo	sikhná].		


                                                                                               344
	
T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 να	 μιλάω	 Eλληνικά	 πιο	 συχνά.	 So	 we	 have,	 μιλάω	 [miláo],	 and	 the	
    closed	 version,	 μιλήσω	 [milíso].	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 Did	 you	 speak;	 Did	 you	
    guys	 speak?	 And	 with	 the	 context,	 we	 can	 imagine,	 to	 each	 other.	 Did	 you	 guys	
    speak	to	each	other?		
	
S:	 Μιλήσατε;	[milísate?].		
	
T:	 Μιλήσατε.	Good.	The	word	for	“early”	was	νωρίς	[norís].	Νωρίς.		
	
S:	 Νωρίς.		
	
T:	 “I	wake	up”,	is	ξυπνάω	[ksipnáo].	Ξυπνάω.		
	
S:	 Ξυπνάω.		
	
T:	 So	 again	 we	 have	 a	 verb	 ending	 “άω”	 [áo],	 no,	 like	 αγαπάω	 [aghapáo],	 μιλάω	
    [miláo],	ξυπνάω	[ksipnáo],	with	its	accent	on	the	ending,	which	of	course	means	
    we’ll	also	find	ξυπνώ	[ksipnó].	Ξυπνάω	or	ξυπνώ	–	“I	wake	up”.	I	want	to	wake	up	
    early.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	ξυπνήσω	νωρίς	[thélo	na	ksipníso	norís].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Θέλω	 να	 ξυπνήσω	 νωρίς.	 So	 this	 would	 refer	 to	 a	 specific	 time	 you	 are	
    discussing.	No?	What	if	you	were	to	say,	I	want	to	wake	up	early,	with	the	open,	
    standard	form	of	the	verb?	Θέλω	να	ξυπνάω	νωρίς	[thélo	na	ksipnáo	norís].	What,	
    what	might	that	mean?		
	
S:	 I	want	to	make	it	a	habit	to	get	up	earlier,	or	early.		
	
T:	 Yeah,	like,	“I	want	to	be	a	person	that	gets	up	early”.	So	also	kind	of	including	the	
    meaning	 of	 “able	 to”,	 of	 μπορώ	 [boró],	 just	 in	 the	 idea	 of	 the	 open	 form	 of	 the	
    verb,	no?	It’s	like,	I	want	to	be	able	to	wake	up	early.	I	want	to	be	a	person	that	
    gets	 up	early.	Θέλω	να	ξυπνάω	 νωρίς.	What	if	you	were	to	say,	I	can’t	wake	up	
    early,	and	you	meant	generally,	not	a	specific	time	like	tomorrow.	Generally,	you	
    know,	I’m	incapable	of	waking	up	early.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	ξυπνάω	νωρίς	[dhen	boró	na	ksipnáo	norís].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορώ	να	ξυπνάω	νωρίς.	What	was	the	word	for,	when?		
	
S:	 Πότε	[póte].		
	
T:	 Πότε.	When	did	you	guys	wake	up?		
	
S:	 Πότε	ξυπνήσατε;	[póte	ksipnísate?].		
	


                                                                                               345
T:	 Πότε	ξυπνήσατε;	Very	good.		
	
	 Ρωτάω	[rotáo],	ρωτάω	means,	“I	ask”.	Ρωτάω.		
	
S:	 Ρωτάω.		
	
T:	 R	(ρ/Ρ)	-	Ο	(ω/Ω)	-	Τ	(τ/Τ)	-	Α	(α/Α)	-	Ο	(ω/Ω)	–	ρωτάω	[rotáo].	And	of	course	we	
    could	also	have	ρωτώ	[rotó].	So,	what	would	be	the	closed	version	of	ρωτάω,	or	
    ρωτώ?		
	
S:	 Ρωτήσω	[rotíso].		
	
T:	 Ρωτήσω.	I	wanted	to	ask	you	something.		
	
S:	 Ήθελα	να	σου	ρωτήσω	κάτι	[íthela	na	su	rotíso	káti].		
	
T:	 Good.	But,	actually	here	we	have,	Ήθελα	να	σε	ρωτήσω	κάτι	[íthela	na	se	rotíso	
    káti].	Now	you	can	be	totally	forgiven	for	thinking	that	it’s	“σου”	[su],	no?	Because	
    it	 asks	 something	 “to	 you”,	 and	 different	 languages	 that	 have	 this	 difference	
    between	“you”	and	“to	you”,	and	“him”	and	“to	him”,	actually	disagree	on	what	
    this	should	be	–	what	we	should	use	with,	“to	ask”.	For	example,	in	Spanish	you	
    use	“to	him”	when	you	use	“to	ask”,	but	not	in	Greek.	So,	“to	ask”,	we	just	use,	σε	
    [se].	We	ask	directly	somebody,	rather	than	“to”	somebody	in	Greek.	Ήθελα	να	σε	
    ρωτήσω	κάτι.		
	
	 So	the	use	of	“ήθελα”	[íthela]	is	a	little	bit	polite,	no?	Ήθελα	–	“I	wanted”,	rather	
    than	 “θέλω”	 [thélo].	 Makes	 it	 a	 little	 bit	 softer.	 You	 could	 be	 even	 more	 polite,	
    you	could	say,	you	know,	I	would	want	to	ask	you	something.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήθελα	να	σε	ρωτήσω	κάτι	[tha	íthela	na	se	rotíso	káti].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	ήθελα.	Θα	ήθελα	να	σε	ρωτήσω	κάτι.	I	would	want,	I	would	like	to	ask	
    you	something.		
	
	 But	we	could	also	use	the	plural	“you”,	to	be	polite.	So	we	saw	how	we	have	this	
    plural	 “you”,	 which	 we	 can	 also	 use	 with	 one	 person,	 to	 be	 polite.	 So,	 σε	 [se]	 is	
    “you”,	no,	and	the	plural	“you”	is	σας	[sas],	which	works	for	“you”	or	“to	you”.	It	
    works	 for	 both.	 Σας.	 So,	 I	 would	 like	 to	 ask	 you	 something,	 now	 being	 super-
    formal.		
	
S:	 Θα	ήθελα	να	σας	ρωτήσω	κάτι	[tha	íthela	na	sas	rotíso	káti].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θα	 ήθελα	 να	 σας	 ρωτήσω	 κάτι.	 Very	 good.	 So	 now	 we	 are	 super-
    formal,	no?	We	have,	θα	ήθελα	[tha	íthela],	and	also	σας	[sas].		
	
	 You	 will	 hear	 in	 Greek,	 Γειά	 σου	 [ya	 su],	 like	 “goodbye”,	 or	 “hello”	 –	 γειά	 σου.	
    Literally,	 “your	 health”.	 So	 this	 isn’t	 the	 για	 [ya]	 of	 “for”;	 it’s	 γειά	 [ya],	 meaning	


                                                                                                   346
    “health”.	Actually	related	to	“hygiene”;	and	a	strange	spelling	of	hygiene,	with	the	
    Y	 (υ)	 and	 the	 G	 (γ),	 is	 from	 Greek	 –	 υγειά	 [iyá].	 And	 of	 course	 “health”	 and	
    “hygiene”	are	related,	no?	So	we	have,	γειά	σου	[ya	su]	–	“your	health”	–	used	for	
    “hello”	 and	 “goodbye”.	 And	 if	 you’re	 talking	 to	 more	 than	 one	 person,	 or	 being	
    polite	or	formal,	how	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Γειά	σας	[ya	sas].		
	
T:	 Γειά	σας.	Νο?	Because	I	said,	of	course,	σας	[sas]	works	for	“you”	or	“to	you”.	So	
    also	for	the	possession,	Your	health.	Γειά	σας.	For	toasting,	you	might	hear,	Our	
    health.	How	will	that	be?		
	
S:	 Γειά	μας	[ya	mas].		
	
T:	 Γειά	μας.		
	
	 So	that’s	a	whole	bunch	of	verbs	that	you	automatically	know	the	closed	version	
    for,	no?	Ξυπνάω	[ksipnáo]	–	“I	wake	up”	–	ξυπνήσω	[ksipníso];	ρωτάω	[rotáo]	–	“I	
    ask”	 –	 ρωτήσω	 [rotíso];	 μιλάω	 [miláo]	 –	 “I	 speak”	 –	 μιλήσω	 [miláo];	 προσπαθώ	
    [prospathó]	–	“I	try”	–	προσπαθήσω	[prospathíso];	and	many,	many	more.

Teacher:	Πουλάω	[puláo],	like	in	“monopoly”,	like	μόνο-πουλάω	[móno-puláo],	is	“I	
    sell”.	Πουλάω	–	“I	sell”.		
	
Student:	Πουλάω.		
	
T:	 	So	what	would	the	closed	version	of	πουλάω	[puláo]	be?		
	
S:	 Πουλήσω	[pulíso].		
	
T:	 Πουλήσω.	I	want	to	sell	them,	neuter	them.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	τα	πουλήσω	[thélo	na	ta	pulíso].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	 να	 τα	 πουλήσω.	 I	 want	 to	 sell	 all	 of	 them.	 I	 want	 sell	 it	 all.	 I	 want	 to	 sell	
    everything.	
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	τα	πουλήσω	όλα	[thélo	na	ta	pulíso	óla].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 We	 had	 όλος	 [ólos]	 for	 “all”,	 and	 then	 όλα	 [óla],	 no,	 in	 the	 neuter	
    plural.	Θέλω	να	τα	πουλήσω	όλα.	I	want	to	sell	all	of	it.	I	want	to	sell	everything.	
    We	 could	 also	 say,	 τα	 πάντα	 [ta	 pánda].	 Θέλω	 να	 πουλήσω	 τα	 πάντα	 [thélo	 na	
    pulíso	ta	pánda].		
	
	 How	would	you	say,	We	have	two	months	in	order,	so	that,	we	sell	everything	–		
    we	sell	it	all?	So,	for	“month”,	we	have,	μήνας	[mínas].	Mήνας.	This	is	masculine,	
    but	 masculine	 words	 ending	 AS	 (ας)	 [as],	 tend	 to	 go	 into	 the	 plural	 with	 ES	 (ες)	
    [es].	 So	 we	 have	 μήνας	 [mínas]	 and	 μήνες	 [mínes].	 So	 like,	 άντρας	 [ándras],	 the	
    word	 for	 “man”,	 of	 course	 also	 masculine,	 and	 άντρες	 [ándres]	 in	 the	 plural.	
    “Month”,	μήνας	[mínas],	and	“months”,	μήνες	[mínes].	So,	We	have	two	months.

S:	 Ρωτάω.		
	
T:	 And	the	closed	form?		
	
S:	 Ρωτήσω	[rotíso].		
	
T:	 Ρωτήσω.	So	we	saw	before	how,	when	you	say,	“I	ask	you”,	you	say,	σε	ρωτάω	[se	
    rotáo],	rather	than,	σου	ρωτάω	[su	rotáo].	I	ask	you	directly,	rather	than	“to	you”.	
    I	asked	him	yesterday.	The	word	for	“yesterday”,	was	χθες	[chthes]	or	χτες	[chtes].	
    I	asked	him	yesterday.		
	
S:	 Τον	ρώτησα	χθες	[ton	rótisa	chthes].		
	
T:	 Τον	ρώτησα	χθες.	No?	So	we	use	σε	[se]	instead	of	σου	[su];	τον	[ton]	instead	of	
    του	 [tu],	 with	 ρωτάω	 [rotáo].	 But,	 if	 we	 say,	 “I	 ask	 you	 it”,	 for	 example	 –	 if	 we	
    include	 the	 “it”	 (το	 [to]),	 then	 we	 would	 use	 σου	 [su]	 –	 σου	 το	 [su	 to].	 We	
    wouldn’t	ever	say,	σε	το	[se	to];	we	wouldn’t	have	“σε”	and	“το”	together.	So,	I	
    asked	him	it,	yesterday?		
	
S:	 Του	το	ρώτησα	χθες	[tu	to	rótisa	chthes].		
	
T:	 Good.	“Του”	here.	Του	το	ρώτησα	χθες.		
	
	 “I	ask	for”	is	a	different	verb	in	Greek.	“I	ask	for”,	I	ask	for,	is	ζητάω	[zitáo].		
	
S:	 Ζητάω.		
	
T:	 Well,	 ζητάω	 [zitáo],	 or	 ζητώ	 [zitó],	 like	 we	 can	 have	 either,	 ρωτάω	 [rotáo],	 or	
    ρωτώ	 [rotó].	 Ζητάω	 –	 “I	 ask	 for”.	 So	 that’s	 different	 to,	 “I	 ask”,	 like,	 “I	 ask	 a	
    question”.		
	
S:	 Ζητάω.		
	
T:	 And	in	its	closed	form?		
	
S:	 Ζητήσω	[zitíso].		
	
T:	 Ζητήσω.	I	asked	him	for	it	yesterday.	So	we	don’t	need	the	“for”,	in	Greek.	We	will	
    say,	I	asked	him	it	yesterday,	but	we’re	going	to	use	the	verb,	“to	ask	for”,	ζητάω.	I

	 These	 verbs,	 with	 their	 accents	 on	 their	 endings,	 don’t	 take	 “ετε”	 [ete]	 for	 the	
    plural,	 or	 formal	 “you”,	 in	 their	 standard	 form.	 We’ve	 already	 seen	 that	 in	 their

S:	 Θέλω	να	προσπαθήσετε	[thélo	na	prospathísete].		
	
T:	 Θέλω	 να	 προσπαθήσετε.	 So,	 in	 this	 closed	 form,	 προσπαθήσω	 [prospathíso],

    “είτε”	[íte]	or	“άτε”	[áte],	for	the	plural	“you”.	So,	“You	guys	are	able”,	or,	“You	
    (formal)	can”,	is	μπορείτε	[boríte].		
	
S:	 Μπορείτε.		
	
T:	 First	we	can	look	at	those	that	take	“είτε”	[íte].	We	have,	μπορείτε	[boríte];	also,

    go	 back	 to	 “ετε”	 [ete].	 Like	 we	 saw,	 I	 want	 you	 guys	 to	 try	 –	 Θέλω	 να	
    προσπαθήσετε	[thélo	na	prospathísete].	Will	you	guys	try?		
	
S:	 Θα	προσπαθήσετε;	[tha	prospathísete?].		
	
T:	 Θα	προσπαθήσετε;	Won’t	you	try?	Will	you	not	try?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	προσπαθήσετε;	[dhen	tha	prospathísete?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Δεν	θα	προσπαθήσετε;	Did	you	try?	Did	you	guys	try?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθήσατε;	[prospathísate?].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθήσατε;	And	now	we	have	“ατε”	[ate]	popping	up	again	for	the	past,	no?	
    But	in	the	present,	standard,	open	form,	“ειτε”	[íte].	So,	You	guys	are	trying?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθείτε	[prospathíte].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθείτε.	You	aren’t	even	trying.	So	we	saw	how	we	can	say,	ούτε	που	[úte	
    pu]	–	“Not	even	that,	you	guys	try”,	for,	You	aren’t	even	trying.	So	how	would	that	
    be?		
	
S:	 Ούτε	που	προσπα	...	Ούτε	που	προσπαθείτε	[úte	pu	prospathíte].		
	
T:	 You	aren’t	even	trying.	Ούτε	που	προσπαθείτε.	Good.		
	
	 So	 these	 verbs	 that	 take	 “είτε”	 [íte]	for	 “you”	 plural,	 or	 formal,	 can	 have	 “είτε”,	
    “ατε”	[ate],	or	“ετε”	[ete],	depending	on	the	situation,	no?	We	have	“ειτε”	in	the	
    standard,	 present,	form	 of	the	verb.	We	have	“ετε”	when	it’s	in	 its	closed	form,	
    and	then	“ατε”	in	the	past.	So	don’t	worry	about	the	panorama,	only	think	about	
    the	 endings	 that	 you	 need	 for	 the	 sentence	 that	 you’re	 making,	 when	 you’re	
    making	it,	no,	rather	than	worrying	about	the	whole	panorama.		
	
	 So,	give	me	the	verb,	I	live,	like	related	to	“zoo”.		
	
S:	 Ζω	[zo].		
	
T:	 Ζω.	He	lives?		
	
S:	 Ζει.		
	
T:	 Ζει.	You	live,	informal?		
	
S:	 Ζεις	[zis].		


                                                                                              351
	
T:	 Ζεις.	They	live?		
	
S:	 Ζουν	[zun].		
	
T:	 Ζουν,	or	ζούνε	[zúne].	And	then	for	the	“you”	plural,	or	the	“you”	formal,	we	have	
    “είτε”	[íte].	So,	You	guys	live?		
	
S:	 Ζείτε	[zíte].		
	
T:	 Ζείτε.	Where	do	you	live?	Where	do	you	guys	live?		
	
S:	 Πού	ζείτε;	[pu	zíte?].		
	
T:	 Πού	 ζειτε;	 Where	 do	 you	 guys	 want	 to	 live?	 And	 we	 are	 referring	 to	 a	 closed	
    period	of	time.	Where	do	you	guys	want	to	live?		
	
S:	 Πού	θέλετε	να	ζήσετε;	[pu	thélete	na	zísete?].		
	
T:		Very	good.	Πού	θέλετε	να	ζήσετε;	So	now,	in	the	closed	form	of	the	verb,	we	have	
    “ετε”	[ete]	coming	up.	Where	did	you	want	to	live?	Again,	a	closed	period	of	time.	
    Where	did	you	guys	want	to	live?		
	
S:	 Πού	θέλατε	να	ζήσετε;	[pu	thélate	na	zísete?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	θέλατε	να	ζήσετε;	Very	good.	And	what	if	you	were	referring	to,	
    like,	an	open	period	of	time.	Where	did	you	guys	want	to	live?		
	
S:	 Πού	θέλετε	να	ζείτε;	[pu	thélete	na	zíte?].		
	
T:	 Where	did	you	guys?	Again.		
	
S:	 Πού	θέλατε	να	ζείτε;	[pu	thélate	na	zíte?].		
	
T:		Good,	and	back	to	“ειτε”	[íte].	No?	Πού	θέλατε	να	ζείτε;	–	for	the	standard,	open	
    form.	Good.	Where	would	you	guys	like	to	live?	So,	Where,	where	would	you	guys	
    like	to	live?		
	
S:	 Πού	θα	θέλετε	να	ζήσετε;	[pu	tha	thélete	na	zísete?].		
	
T:	 This	would	mean,	“Where	will	you	guys	like	to	live?”	Πού	θα	θέλετε	να	ζήσετε;		
	
S:	 Πού	θα	θέλατε	να	ζήσετε;	[pu	tha	thélate	na	zísete?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	θα	θέλατε	να	ζήσετε;	Very	good.	Or,	we	could	also	have,	Πού	θα	
    θέλατε	 να	 ζείτε;	 [pu	 tha	 thélate	 na	 zíte?],	 in	 a	 different	 context.	 Where	 did	 you	
    guys	live?	Where	did	you	guys	live?	If	we’re	referring	to	a	closed	period	of	time.	


                                                                                               352
	
S:	 Πού	ζήσατε;	[pu	zísate?].		
	
T:		Πού	ζήσατε;	
	
	 So	maybe	with	the	issues	in	the	closed	form,	πού	ζήσατε;	[pu	zísate?],	we	might	
    be	asking,	you	know,	in	which	places	have	you	lived.	Maybe	here	the	closed	form	
    of	 the	 verb	 gives	 us	 the	 meaning,	 the	 feeling,	 of	 “have”,	 like,	 Where	 have	 you	
    lived?	In	which	places	have	you	lived?	Πού	ζήσατε;	Rather	than,	Where	were	you	
    living?	No?	So	we	could	add	“είτε”	[íte],	“ατε”	[ate],	or	“ετε”	[ete],	no,	depending	
    on	what	time	we	are	in,	whether	it’s	present	or	past,	or	open	or	closed,	with	these	
    verbs.	Very	good.

Teacher:	So	for	plural	“you”	we	have	“ετε”	[ete],	but	we	mentioned	that	with	verbs	
    with	their	accent	on	the	end,	we	could	have	“είτε”	[íte]	or	“άτε”	[áte].	So	far	we	
    saw	 some	 “είτε”	 examples,	 no:	 μπορείτε	 [boríte],	 προσπαθείτε	 [prospathíte],	
    ζείτε	[zíte].	Those	verbs	ending	“άω”	[áo],	or,	like	we’ve	seen,	they	can	end	“άω”	
    [áo]	or	“ώ”	[o],	like	μιλάω,	ρωτάω,	αγαπάω,	use	“άτε”.	So,	You	guys	are	speaking?		
	
Student:	Μιλάτε	[miláte].		
	
T:	 Μιλάτε.	What	was	the	word	for	for,	in	the	sense	of,	For	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Για	[ya].		
	
T:	 Για.	Good.	Για	can	also	mean	“about”,	about.	But	if	you	say,	“What	are	you	guys	
    talking	 about?”,	 you	 probably	 won’t	 say,	 “About	 what	 are	 you	 guys	 talking?”.	
    Why?	When	we	built	that,	how	would	that	be?	About	what	are	you	guys	talking?		
	
S:	 Για	τι	μιλάτε;	[ya	ti	miláte?].

S:	 Um.		
	
T:	 What	does	that	mean?	Γιατί	μιλάτε;		
	
S:	 Well	it	could	be	like,	“Why	are	you	talking?”		
	
T:	 “Why	are	you	talking?”	So	we	won’t	use	this	to	say,	“What	are	you	talking	about?”	
    It	will	sound	like,	“Why	are	you	talking?”	–	Για	τι	μιλάτε;	So	to	say,	“What	are	you	
    talking	about?”,	you	can	say,	“About	what	thing	are	you	talking?”	–	Για	τι	πράγμα;	
    [ya	ti	prághma?],	or,	“Αbout	which	thing?”	–	Για	πoιο	πράγμα;	[ya	pyo	prághma?].

S:	 Για	πoιο	πράγμα	μιλάτε;	[ya	pyo	prághma	miláte?].

	 So	 we	 said	 “ποιο”	 [pyo]	 is	 like	 “which”,	 no?	 Για	 ποιο	 πράγμα,	 για	 ποιο	 πράγμα

    feminine.	If	you	were	to	say,	“Who	do	you	love?”;	if	I	say,	“Who	do	you	love?”.

S:	 Like	“him”.		
	
T:	 Like	“him”,	no?	Which	is	why,	in	more	correct	English,	actually	we	say,	“Whom	do

    whether	 something	 is	 behaving	 like	 “he”	 or	 “him”,	 or	 “she”	 or	 “her”,	 actually	 is	
    not	 entirely	 alien	 to	 us.	 It	 happens	 in	 English,	 only	 in	 just	 very	 few	 places.	 So	
    here’s	where	we	would	say,	“Whom	do	you	love?”,	in	very	correct	English.		
	
	 Ποιος	[pyos],	the	word	for	“who”,	for	masculine	or	“which”,	for	a	masculine	thing,	
    is	going	to	behave	more	like	“τον”	[ton],	like	the	word	for	“the”,	or	“him”,	rather	
    than	any	other	masculine	noun	just	losing	its	S	(ς).	So	how	would	that	be?	Who

S:	 Σας	[sas].		
	
T:	 Σας.	So,	I	love	you	guys?		
	
S:	 Σας	αγαπάω	[sas	aghapáo].		
	
T:	 Σας	αγαπάω.	 So	those	verbs,	 with	 their	 accent	on	the	end,	 that	 use,	“άτε”	 [áte]	
    and	 “άς”	 [ás]	 for	 plural	 formal,	 and	 also	 the	 informal,	 can	 also	 have	 this	 A	 (ά)	
    popping	 up	 in	 the	 “we”	 and	 “they”	 forms	 of	 the	 verbs.	 But	 these	 are	 more	 like	
    alternative	forms	that	co-exist.	So	for,	“We	speak”,	for	example,	we	could	have,	
    μιλούμε	 [milúme]	 or,	 μιλάμε	 [miláme].	 For	 “They	 speak”	 –	 μιλούν	 [milún],	
    μιλούνε	 [milúne]	 or,	 μιλάνε,	 μιλάν	 [miláne,	 milán].	 For	 “We	 love”	 –	 αγαπούμε	
    [aghapúme]	 or,	 αγαπάμε	 [aghapáme];	 “They	 love”	 –	 αγαπούνε,	 αγαπάνε,	
    αγαπούν,	 αγαπάν	 [aghapúne,	 aghapáne,	 aghapún,	 aghapán].	 So	 these	 forms	 co-
    exist.		
	
	 And	again,	this	doesn’t	cause	any	confusion	with	the	past,	because	we	build	that	
    from	 our	 closed	 version.	 So	 we	 have,	 αγαπάμε	 [aghapáme]	 –	 “We	 love”,	 in	 the	
    present,	but,	We	loved,	would	be?		
	
S:	 Αγαπήσαμε	[aghapísame].		
	
T:	 Αγαπήσαμε.		


                                                                                                359
	
	 And	apart	from	this,	the	he/she/it	form	can	be	seen	with	or	without	the	A-I	(άει).	
  So	we	could	have	ρωτάει	[rotái]	–	“he/she/it	asks”,	or	just	ρωτά	[rotá];	αγαπάει	
  [aghapái]	or	just	αγαπά	[aghapá].	So	we	see	these	“άω”	[áo]	verbs	that	can	end	
  “άω”	 or	 “ώ”	 (ρωτάω,	 ρωτώ),	 are	 a	 little	 more	 varied	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 forming	
  their	 different	 versions.	 So	 we	 shouldn’t	 be	 confused	 when	 we	 come	 across	
  different	forms	that	co-exist.

Teacher:	If	you	want	to	say	something	like,	“I	just	told	you”,	you	can	use	the	word	
    μόλις	[mólis],	in	Greek.	Mόλις.	So	you	would	say,	“Mόλις,	I	told	you”.		
	
Student:	Mόλις	σου	είπα	[mólis	su	ípa].		
	
T:	 Mόλις	σου	είπα.	Good.	So	we	have,	λέω	[léo]	–	“I	tell,	I	say”;	πω	[po]	in	the	closed	
    form;	and	then,	είπα	[ípa]	in	the	past.	Mόλις	σου	είπα	–	I	just	told	you.		
	
	 What	was,	I	ask?		
	
S:	 Ρωτάω	[rotáo].	
	
T:	 Ρωτάω.	He	(or	she)	asks?

T:	 Ρωτάει,	or	just,	ρωτά	[rotá].	You	ask,	informally?		
	
S:	 Ρωτάς	[rotás].		
	
T:	 Ρωτάς.	And	the	formal,	or	the	plural,	You	guys	ask?		
	
S:	 Ρωτάτε	[rotáte].		
	
T:	 Ρωτάτε.	Ζητάω	[zitáo]	was,	“I	ask	for”.	So	how	is,	He	asks	for;	She	asks	for?		
	
S:	 Ζητάει	[zitái].		
	
T:	 Ζητάει,	or	ζητά	[zitá].	You	(plural)	ask	for?		
	
S:	 Ζητάτε	[zitáte].		
	
T:	 Ζητάτε.	And,	Υou	(informal),	normal	“you”	that	we	use	...	?		
	
	S:	Ζητάς	[zitás].		
	
T:	 Ζητάς.	And	we	also	have	these	optional	A’s	(ά’s)	popping	up,	for	the	“we”	and	the	
    “they”	forms.	So	how	do	you	say,	We	ask	for?		
	
S:	 Ζητάμε	[zitáme].

T:	 Ζητάνε,	ζητάν,	ζητούνε,	ζητούν	[zitáne,	zitán,	zitúne,	zitún].	So,	the	closed	version	
    of	ζητάω	[zitáo],	is?		
	
S:	 Ζητήσω	[zitíso].		
	
T:	 Ζητήσω.	I	asked,	from	ζητήσω	[zitíso]?		
	
S:	 Ζήτησα	[zítisa].		
	
T:	 Ζήτησα.	I	just	asked	for	it.		
	
S:	 Μόλις	το	ζήτησα	[mólis	to	zítisa].		
	
T:	 Μόλις	το	ζήτησα.	I	just	asked	you	for	it.		
	
S:	 Μόλις	σου	το	ζήτησα	[mólis	su	to	zítisa].		
	
T:	 Μόλις	σου	το	ζήτησα.	They	just	asked	me	for	it.		
	
S:	 Μόλις	με	το	ζητήσανε	[mólis	me	to	zitísane].		
	
T:	 So	we	couldn’t	have	“με”	[me]	and	“το”	[to]	together.		
	
S:	 Ah	…	Μόλις	μου	το	ζητήσανε	[mólis	mu	to	zitísane].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μόλις	 μου	 το	 ζητήσανε.	 They	 just	 asked	 me	 for	 it.	 Μόλις	 μου	 το	
    ζητήσανε.		
	
	 Ξυπνάω	 [ksipnáo],	 ξυπνάω,	 was	 “I	 wake	 up”.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 When	 do	 you	
    wake	up?	–	talking	to	a	friend,	or	talking	to	somebody	informally?		
	
S:	 Πότε	ξυπνάς;	[póte	ksipnás?].		
	
T:	 Πότε	ξυπνάς;	So	we	have	“άω”	[áo],	no,	in	ξυπνάω	[ksipnáo],	which	means	that	
    we	 have	 “άς”	 [ás],	 for	 “you”.	 And	 what	 if	 you’re	 talking	 plurally?	 When	 do	 you	
    guys	wake	up?		
	
S:	 Πότε	ξυπνάτε;	[póte	ksipnáte?].		
	
T:	 Πότε	ξυπνάτε;	When	did	you	guys	wake	up?		
	
S:	 Πότε	ξυπνήσατε;	[póte	ksipnísate?].		
	
T:	 Πότε	ξυπνήσατε;	Did	you	guys	just	wake	up?		
	
S:	 Μόλις	ξυπνήσατε;	[mólis	ksipnísate?].		
	


                                                                                            362
T:	 Μόλις	ξυπνήσατε;	Did	you	just	wake	up?	–	informally.		
	
S:	 Μόλις	ξυπνησάς;	[mólis	ksipnisás?].		
	
T:	 So,	 this	 is	 kind	 of	 an	 automatic	 thing	 going	 between	 “ατε”	 [ate]	 and	 “ας”	 [as],	
    maybe,	no?	What	do	we	have	for	“you”,	informal,	in	the	past?		
	
S:	 “-ες”	[-es].		
	
T:	 ES	(-ες),	no?	[es].	Good.		
	
S:	 Μόλις	ξυπνησές;	[mólis	ksipnisés?].		
	
T:	 Μόλις	ξύπνησες;	[mólis	ksípnises?].	Good.	So,	in	the	past,	we	have	[a]	(α),	no,	for	
    most	people,	but	for	he/she/it,	we	have	[e]	(ε),	and	for	you,	informal,	we	have	[es]	
    (ες),	in	the	past,	no?	Μόλις	ξύπνησες;	[mólis	ksípnises?]	–	for	“you”,	singular,	but	
    then,	“you	guys”	–	μόλις	ξυπνήσατε;	[mólis	ksipnísate?].		
	
	 Μόλις	 can	 also	 mean,	 “As	 soon	 as”,	 when	 you	 use	 it	 in	 the	 present.	 So,	 for	
    example,	you	could	say	something	like,	you	know,	You	should	call	me	as	soon	as	
    you	wake	up.	So	we	can	just	start	that	with,	“Nα	–	you	should	call	me”.	So,	You	
    should	take	me	phone.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Να	με	πάρεις	τηλέφωνω	[na	me	páris	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Good.	No?	We	have,	παίρνω	[pérno],	and	then	the	closed	form,	πάρω	[páro].	Να	
    με	πάρεις	τηλέφωνω	...	as	soon	as	you	wake	up.	So	we	will	say,	“μόλις”	[mólis],	
    and	after	μόλις,	we	need	to	make	a	decision	about	using	the	closed	or	the	open	
    form	of	the	verb.		
	
S:	 Μόλις	ξυπνήσεις	[mólis	ksipnísis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Να	με	πάρεις	τηλέφωνω	μόλις	ξυπνήσεις	[na	me	páris	tiléfono	mólis	
    ksipnísis].	So,	after	μόλις,	we	will	use	the	closed	form,	no?	“As	soon	as”	–	we	are	
    referring	to	a	closed	event.	You	should	call	me	as	soon	as	you	arrive.		
	
S:	 Να	με	πάρεις	τηλέφωνω	μόλις	φτάσεις	[na	me	páris	tiléfono	mólis	ftásis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Να	με	πάρεις	τηλέφωνω	μόλις	φτάσεις.	I	want	to	see	it	as	soon	as	it	
    arrives.	I	want	to	see	it	as	soon	as	it	arrives.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	το	δω	μόλις	φτάσει	[thélo	na	to	dho	mólis	ftási].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	να	το	δω	μόλις	φτάσει.		
	
	 So	we’re	seeing	how	we	have	some	verbs	that	are	a	little	odd,	in	that	they	have	
    the	accent	on	the	end,	no?	And	nearly	all	of	them	go	into	their	closed	form	in	the	


                                                                                             363
   same	way,	which	is	useful	for	us,	no?	Some	of	the	verbs,	with	their	accents	on	the	
   end,	are,	συμφωνώ	[simfonó].	Συμφωνώ,	which	means	“I	agree”	–	συμφωνώ.		
	
S:	 Συμφωνώ.		
	
T:	 Which	is	something	like,	“together	voice”,	no?	“I	together	voice”,	“I	with	voice”.	
    Συμ	 [sim]	 or	 συν	 [sin]	 means,	 like,	 “with”;	 and	 φωνώ	 [fonó],	 like	 in	 τηλέφωνο	
    [tiléfono]	–	“voice”	or	“sound”.	How	would	you	say,	Do	you	guys	agree?		
	
S:	 Well	it’s	either	“είτε”	[íte]	or	“άτε”	[áte].		
	
T:	 So,	“άτε”	goes	with	verbs	that	have	“άω”	[áo],	like	in	αγαπάω	[aghapáo],	μιλάω	
    [miláo].		
	
S:	 OK.	Συμφωνείτε	[simfoníte].		
	
T:	 Συμφωνείτε.	Don’t	you	guys	agree?		
	
S:	 Δεν	συμφωνείτε;	[dhen	simfoníte?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	συμφωνείτε;	Didn’t	you	guys	agree?	So	now	we	need	the	closed	version.	Let’s	
    do	that	first.	“Συμφωνώ”	becomes	...	?	
	
S:	 Συμφωνήσω	[simfoníso].		
	
T:	 Good.	Didn’t	you	guys	agree?		
	
S:	 Δεν	συμφωνήσατε;	[dhen	simfonísate?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	συμφωνήσατε;	Won’t	you	guys	agree?	So	we	won’t	go	from	συμφωνήσατε.	
    We	go	back	to	συμφωνω,	συμφωνήσω	[simfonó,	simfoníso],	no,	and	think	about	
    what	ending	we	need.	Won’t	you	guys	agree?	Will	you	not	agree?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	συμφωνήσετε;	[dhen	tha	simfonísete?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θα	συμφωνήσετε;	Good.	So,	rather	than	“είτε”	[íte],	no,	which	we	
    have	in	συμφωνείτε	[simfoníte],	when	we’re	out	of	our	standard	form,	when	we	
    use	our	closed	version,	we	go	back	to	“ετε”	[ete].	Δεν	θα	συμφωνήσετε;		
	
	 We	can	also	have	διαφωνώ	[dhiafonó],	which	means,	“I	disagree”.	So,	“δια”	[dhia]	
    can	mean	like,	“through”,	or	“away	from”,	and	then	φωνώ	[fonó]	again,	“sounds”.	
    So,	διαφωνώ	–	“I	disagree”.	Do	you	guys	disagree?		
	
S:	 Διαφωνήσετε	[dhiafonísete]	...	Διαφωνείτε;	[dhiafoníte?].		
	
T:	 Διαφωνείτε;	 Good.	 Διαφωνείτε;	 So	 these	 verbs	 that	 take	 “είτε”	 [íte],	 don’t	 have	
    any	 other	 strange	 forms,	 no?	 Συμφωνώ	 [simfonó],	 συμφωνεί	 [simfoní],	


                                                                                          364
   συμφωνούμε	 [simfonúme],	 συμφωνούν	 [simfonún],	 συμφωνούνε	 [simfonúne],	
   συμφωνείς	 [simfonís].	 No?	 But	 those	 taking	 “άτε”	 [áte]	 have	 other	 A’s	 (ά)s	
   popping	 up	 all	 over	 the	 place,	 no?	 We’ve	 seen,	 μιλάς	 [milás],	 μιλάτε	 [miláte],	
   μιλάει	 [milái]	 or	 μιλά	 [milá];	 and	 then,	 μιλούμε,	 μιλάμε	 [milúme,	 miláme],	
   μιλούνε,	μιλάνε	[milúne,	miláne].		
	
	 Ακούω	[akúo];	ακούω	means	“I	hear”.	Ακούω.		
	
S:	 Ακούω.		
	
T:	 Or,	“I	listen”.	Of	course	related	to	“acoustic”.	This	is	where	we	get	“acoustic”	from	
    in	English,	no?	Ακούω	–	“I	hear”,	and	“acoustic”,	in	English.	So,	ακούω	also	counts	
    as	a	verb	with	its	accent	on	the	ending,	even	though	we	have	“ούω”	[úo]	there,	
    and	the	accent	on	the	“ού”	[ú].	So,	ακούω	is	like	one	of	our	verbs	with	the	accent	
    on	the	end,	but	is	a	little	bit	strange.	How	would	you	say,	He	hears;	She	hears?		
	
S:	 Ακούει	[akúi].	
	
T:	 Ακούει.	We	hear?		
	
S:	 Ακούμε	[akúme].		
	
T:		Ακούμε.	They	hear?		
	
S:	 Ακούνε	[akúne].		
	
T:	 Ακούν	[akún].	Ακούνε.	You	hear?		
	
S:	 Ακούες,	ακούεις	[akúes,	akúis]?		
	
T:	 Ακούς	 [akús].	 It	 would	 be	 ακούεις,	 no,	 we	 have	 “εις”	 [is]	 ending	 in	 the	 present.	
    But	 that	 gets	 swallowed	 up,	 like	 in,	 “I	 eat,	 you	 eat”	 –	 τρώω,	 τρως	 [tróo,	 tros].	
    Aκούς	[akús].	So	also	for	the	plural,	we	have	this	–	just	the	TE	(τε)	on	the	end.	So	
    how	would	that	be?	You	guys	hear.		
	
S:	 Ακούτε	[akúte].		
	
T:		Ακούτε.	Do	you	guys	hear?		
	
S:	 Ακούτε;	[akúte?].		
	
T:	 Don’t	you	guys	hear	me?		
	
S:	 Δεν	με	ακούτε;	[dhen	me	akúte?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	με	ακούτε;	Or	with	a	contraction	of	με	[me]	and	ακούτε	[akúte],	you	would	
    hear,	 δεν	 μ’	 ακούτε;	 [dhen	 m’akúte?].	 Δεν	 μ’	 ακούτε;	 So	 in	 the	 same	 way,	 the	


                                                                                               365
   closed	version	of	ακούω	[akúo]	is,	ακούσω	[akúso].	It	loses	the	[i]	(η)	of	the	“-ήσ-“	
   [-ís-]	 that	 we	 tend	 to	 put:	 μιλάω,	 μιλήσω	 [miláo,	 milíso].	 No?	 We	 go,	 ακούω,	
   ακούσω	[akúo,	akúso].		
	
S:	 Ακούσω.		
	
T:		Did	you	hear?	–	speaking	informally.	Did	you	hear?		
	
S:	 Άκουσες;	[ákuses?].		
	
T:	 Άκουσες;	Did	you	guys	hear?		
	
S:	 Ακούσατε;	[akúsate?].		
	
T:	 Ακούσατε;	How	would	you	say,	informally,	You	don’t	want	to	hear.	You	don’t	want	
    to	listen.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλεις	να	ακούσεις	[dhen	thélis	na	akúsis].		
	
T:		Δεν	θέλεις	να	ακούσεις.	You	guys	don’t	want	to	hear.	You	don’t	want	to	listen.	
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλετε	να	ακούσετε	[dhen	thélete	na	akúsete].		
	
T:		Δεν	θέλετε	να	ακούσετε.		
	
	 So	with	these	verbs,	we	have	a	very	standard	way	of	going	into	our	closed	version,	
    no?	Συμφωνώ	[simfonó],	I	agree,	συνφωνήσω	[simfoníso];	ακούω	[akúo],	ακούσω	
    [akúso];	 ξυπνάω	 [ksipnáo],	 I	 wake	 up,	 ξυπνήσω	 [ksipníso];	 ρωτάω	 [rotáo],	 I	 ask,	
    ρωτήσω	[rotíso].	And	there	are	a	couple	of	slightly	different	one	as	well.	Μπορώ	
    [boró]	becomes	μπορέσω	[boréso],	rather	than	μπορήσω	[boríso],	no?	We	have	
    μπορέσω.		
	
S:	 Μπορέσω	[boréso].		
	
T:	 Καλώ	[kaló]	also	–	to	call,	to	invite	–	becomes,	καλέσω	[kaléso].		
	
S:	 Καλέσω.		
	
T:	 But	only	a	few,	no?	Otherwise	we	have	“-ήσω”	[-íso].	How	would	you	say,	I	want	
    to	invite	you?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	σε	καλέσω	[thélo	na	se	kaléso].		
	
T:		Θέλω	να	σε	καλέσω.	I	want	to	be	able	to?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μπορέσω	[thélo	na	boréso].		
	


                                                                                          366
T:	 Θέλω	να	μπορέσω.	Good.		But	 otherwise,	 it’s	 pretty	 trusty	 to	 get	 our	 closed	
    version	 with	 “-ήσ-“	 [-ís-].	 For	 example,	 we	 could	 have,	 εννοώ	 [enoó],	 I	 mean,	
    εννοήσω	[enoíso];	φιλώ	[filó],	I	kiss,	probably	from	the	same	root	as	φίλος	[fílos],	
    no,	friend,	related	to	love:	φιλώ,	I	kiss,	φιλήσω	[filíso]	in	its	closed	form;	θεωρώ	
    [theoró],	 I	 consider,	 like	 “theory”,	 no,	 θεωρώ	 –	 θεωρήσω	 [theoríso];	 οδηγώ	
    [odhighó],	we	could	have,	I	drive	–	you	will	hear	οδός	[odhós],	meaning	“street”,	
    in	 Greek.	 We	 saw	 δρόμος	 [dhrómos]	 for	 “road”,	 and	 we	 also	 have	 οδός	 for	
    “street”.	 And	 then	 οδηγώ	 [odhighó],	 οδηγώ,	 I	 drive,	 which	 becomes	 οδηγήσω	
    [odhiyíso].	Eξηγώ	[eksighó]	means	“to	explain”	–	literally	meaning	something	like	
    “to	lead	out”	–	εξηγώ.	How	would	you	say,	I	can’t	explain	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορώ	να	το	εξηγήσω	[dhen	boró	na	to	eksiyíso].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορώ	να	το	εξηγήσω.	We	have	the	[gh]	(γ)	softened	there	by	the	
    I	(η)	of	“-ήσω”	[-íso]".	Δεν	μπορώ	να	το	εξηγήσω.	Very	good.

Teacher:	I	don’t	know	if	you’ve	heard	the	word	“cathartic”,	or	“catharsis”	in	English.		
	
Student:	Ah	yeah,	I	have.		
	
T:	 	I	 hadn’t	 until	 my	 twenties,	 when	 someone	 described	 a	 “cathartic	 experience”,	
    and	 for	 a	 moment	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 it	 meant,	 until	 I	 thought	 of	 καθαρίζω	
    [katharízo]	in	Greek,	which	is	“I	clean”	–	καθαρίζω.		
	
S:	 Καθαρίζω.		
	
T:	 And	 then	 I	 understood	 that	 it	 was	 like	 a	 cleansing	 experience,	 this	 cathartic	
    experience.	So	it	might	go	that	way	around	too.	You	may	be	able	to	work	out	the	
    meaning	of	some	quite	highbrow	words	in	English,	just	through	everyday	words	in	
    Greek	.	So	we	have,	καθαρίζω	–	I	clean.		
	
S:	 Καθαρίζω.		
	
T:	 	What	 might	 the	 closed	 version	 of	 καθαρίζω	 be?	 So	 we	 can	 look	 at	 other	 verbs	
    with	 Z	 (ζ),	 and	 what	 they	 become;	 or,	 we	 can	 look	 to	 the	 English	 words,	
    “cathartic”,	 “catharsis”,	 to	 see	 if	 they	 offer	 any	 clues	 about	 what	 the	 closed	
    version	might	be.		
	
S:	 Well	probably,	καθαρίσω	[katharíso].		
	
T:	 Καθαρίσω.	Good.	Why?		
	
S:	 Because	it’s	also	the	S	(σ)	in	“catharsis”.		
	
T:	 Exactly.	“Catharsis”	–	we	have	the	S	(σ)	there;	“cathartic”	doesn’t	help	us:	[t]	(τ)	is	
    not	a	common	sound	that	we	have	in	our	closed	version,	no?	But	“catharsis”,	yes.	
    It	 suggests	 that	 we	 will	 have	 an	 S	 (σ)	 –	 and	 we	 do.	 So,	 καθαρίζω	 [katharízo],	 I	
    clean,	and	καθαρίσω	[katharíso].	How	would	you	say,	You	have	to	clean	it?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	το	καθαρίσεις	[prépi	na	to	katharísis].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	 να	 το	 …	 [prépi	 na	 to],	 if	 we	 mean	 a	 neuter	 thing,	 no,	 …	 	 καθαρίσεις	
    [katharísis].	Good.	So	this	is	like,	like,	you	know,	like	once.	You	should	clean	it;	it’s	
    dirty.	No?	So	we	used	the	closed	form,	καθαρίσεις.	But	what	if	you	were	to	say,	
    You	have	to	clean	it	a	lot.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	το	καθαρίζεις	πολύ	[prépi	na	to	katharízis	polí].		
	
T:	 So	“πολύ”	[polí]	would	sound	like,	you	know,	maybe	make	a	good	clean	of	it.	But	
    here,	 where	 we	 say	 “a	 lot”,	 in	 English,	 we	 actually	 mean	 “often”.	 So	 sometimes	
    you’ll	want	to	say	“a	lot”,	but	you’ll	have	to	think:	Oh!	This	might	actually	give	a	


                                                                                               368
   different	meaning	in	Greek,	whereas	in	English,	it’s	understood:	“often”.	So	what	
   was	the	word	for,	often?		
	
	S:	Συχνά	[sikhná].		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	You	have	to	clean	it	a	lot.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	το	καθαρίζεις	συχνά	[prépi	na	to	katharízis	sikhná].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 το	 καθαρίζεις	 συχνά.	 So,	 when	 “a	 lot”	 means	 “often”,	 we	
    might	 not	 go	 necessarily	 to	 “πολύ”	 [polí],	 if	 it	 can	 cause	 some	 confusion,	 but	
    “συχνά”	 [sikhná].	 And	 this	 might	 also	 mean,	 “You	 must	 clean	 it	 often”,	 in	 the	
    sense	of,	you	know,	“It’s	very	clean;	you	must	clean	it	often	–	It	must	be	that	you	
    clean	it	often”.		
	
	 What	was	the	word	for	“if”?		
	
S:	 Αν	[an].		
	
T:	 Αν.	And,	I	speak?		
	
S:	 Μιλάω	[miláo].		
	
T:	 Μιλάω.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	If	you	want	to	speak	well,	you	have	to	speak	
    often?	If	you	want	to	speak	well	...		
	
S:	 Αν	θέλεις	να	μιλάς	καλά	[an	thélis	na	milás	kalá].		
	
T:	 Υou	have	to	speak	often.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	μιλάς	συχνά	[prépi	na	milás	sikhná].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Αν	 θέλεις	 να	 μιλάς	 καλά,	 πρέπει	 να	 μιλάς	 συχνά	 [an	 thélis	 na	 milás	 kalá,	
    prépi	na	milás	sikhná].		
	
	 So	there	you	chose	both	open,	standard	verb	forms,	which	is	fine.	Both	fit	really	in	
    the	first	bit,	If	you	want	to	speak	well;	we	mean,	generally,	ongoing,	but	you	could	
    hear	 μιλήσεις	 [milísis]	 here.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 speak	 well	 –	 Aν	 θέλεις	 να	 μιλήσεις	
    καλά	[an	thélis	na	milísis	kalá].	So,	you	know,	it	depends	what’s	in	your	mind.	You	
    could	be	thinking,	you	know,	arrive	at	that	point	of	speaking	well,	in	which	case	
    you	put	μιλήσεις	[milísis].	Or	you	just	might	mean,	you	know,	generally	want	to	be	
    speaking	well,	in	which	case	you	can	put	μιλάς	[milás].	You	have	to	speak	often	–	
    Πρέπει	να	μιλάς	συχνά	[prépi	na	milás	sikhná],	and	there	we	have	μιλάς	[milás],	
    because	we	say	συχνά	[sikhná]	–	“often”,	and	that’s	definitely	open	and	ongoing.		
	
	 There’s	 also	 a	 closed	 version	 of	 θέλω	 [thélo],	 which	 you	 might	 hear,	 which	 is	
    θελήσω	[thelíso].		


                                                                                             369
	
S:	 Θελήσω.		
	
T:	 So	 you	 could	 hear,	 Αν	 θελήσεις	 [an	 thelísis].	 But,	 you	 know,	 θελήσω	 is	 not	 as	
    often	 used	 as	 other	 closed	 versions.	 Or	 maybe	 it	 might	 sound	 more	 like	 “wish”,	
    than	“want”.	So	it’s	not	something	you	really	have	to	worry	about,	but	you	may	
    hear	 a	 closed	 version	 of	 θέλω,	 which	 is	 θελήσω.	 The	 other	 reason	 why	 it	 might	
    not	 be	 used	 so	 much	 is	 because	 usually,	 when	 you	 want	 something,	 it	 is	 an	
    ongoing	kind	of	sensation	–	the	idea	of	wanting.		
	
	 What	was	the	word	for,	Greek?		
	
S:	 Τα	Ελληνικά	[ta	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Τα	 Ελληνικά,	 if	 we	 include	 the	 word	 for	 “the”,	 no?	 “The	 Greek”	 –	 Τα	
    Ελληνικά.	So	you	might	include	this	word	for	“the”,	if	you	say	something	like,	you	
    know,	“Greek	isn’t	difficult”.	You’ll	say,	“The	Greek	isn’t	difficult”.		
	
	 The	word	for	“difficult”	is,	δύσκoλος	[dhískolos].	Δύσκoλος.		
	
S:	 Δύσκoλος.		
	
T:	 So	 there	 I	 give	 you	 the	 masculine	 version,	 no,	 the	 adjective,	 or	 the	 describing	
    word.	So,	Greek	isn’t	difficult,	or	The	Greek	isn’t	difficult.		
	
S:	 Τα	Ελληνικά	δεν	είναι	δύσκoλα	[ta	eliniká	dhen	íne	dhískola].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τα	Ελληνικά	δεν	είναι	δύσκoλα.	So	δύσκoλος	seems	to	be	related	to	
    “colon”,	actually.	So	this	might	be	something	like,	something	that’s	hard	to	digest,	
    δύσκoλο,	or	mis-digestion,	something	like	that	–	if	something’s	difficult.	And	then	
    we	have	the	word	for	“easy”	–	εύκολο	[éfkolo],	which	is	like	“good	colon”,	“good	
    digestion”.	Εύκολο		in	the	neuter,	or	εύκολος	[éfkolos]	in	the	masculine.		
	
S:	 Εύκολος.		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 that’s	 “easy”.	 So	 we	 have	 δύσκoλος	 [dhískolos]	 –	 “difficult”;	 εύκολος	
    [éfkolos]	–	“easy”.	How	would	you	say,	Greek	is	easy?		
	
S:	 Τα	Ελληνικά	είναι	εύκολα	[ta	eliniká	íne	éfkola].		
	
T:	 Τα	 Ελληνικά	 είναι	 εύκολα.	 Είναι	 εύκολα	 τα	 Ελλημικά	 [íne	 éfkola	 ta	 eliniká].	 The	
    word	for	“language”,	and	also	“tongue”,	so	in	the	way	that	in	English,	we	can	say,	
    you	 know,	 “mother	 tongue”,	 and	 we	 mean,	 “mother	 language”,	 this	 is	 just	 the	
    standard	 in	 Greek.	 So,	 “language”	 or	 “tongue”	 is,	 γλώσσα	 [ghlósa].	 This	 is	 the	
    γάμα	[gháma]	(γ).	Γλώσσα.		
	
S:	 Γλώσσα.		


                                                                                            370
	
T:	 Good.	This	is	where	we	get	“glossary”	from;	or	to	gloss	over	something,	we	say	in,	
    in	 English.	 To	 gloss	 over	 something	 in	 conversation	 is	 just	 to	 tongue	 over	 it.	 So	
    γλώσσα	[ghlósa],	with	the	γάμα	[gháma]	(γ),	for	“language”.		
	
	 We	had	the	word,	άλλος	[álos]	for	“other”;	and	“all”,	which	sounds	kind	of	similar.	
    What	was	the	word	for,	all?		
	
S:	 Όλος	[ólos].		
	
T:	 Όλος.	 So	 “all”	 isn’t	 άλλος	 [álos].	 No?	 They	 look	 similar,	 but	 άλλος	 means	
    “another”,	 or	 “the	 other”,	 and	 όλος	 [ólos]	 is	 “all”.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 All	 the	
    languages,	every	language,	all	languages,	all	the	languages?		
	
S:	 Όλες	οι	γλώσσες	[óles	i	ghlóses].		
	
T:	 Όλες	οι	γλώσσες.	Very	good.	The	word	for	“correctly”,	or	“right”,	is	σωστά	[sostá].	
    Σωστά.		
	
S:	 Σωστά.		
	
T:	 So	that’s	“correctly”,	“right”,	or	“in	the	right	way”.	Σωστά.	So	you	could	say,	“All	
    languages	 are	 easy	 if	 you	 learn	 them	 correctly”.	 So,	 All	 languages	 (all	 the	
    languages)	are	easy	if	you	learn	them	correctly.		
	
S:	 Όλες	οι	γλώσσες	είναι	εύκολες	αν	τα	μάθεις	σωστά	[óles	i	ghlóses	íne	éfkoles	an	
    ta	máthis	sostá].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	why	“τα”	[ta]	and	“τα	μάθείς	σωστά”	[ta	máthis	sostá]?		
	
S:	 Ah!	Αν	τις	μάθεις	σωστά	[an	tis	máthis	sostá].		
	
T:	 	Very	good.	Όλες	οι	γλώσσες	είναι	εύκολες	αν	τις	[óles	i	ghlóses	íne	éfkoles	an	tis]	
    …	 (because	 we	 refer	 to	 “the	 languages”,	 no?)	 ...	 μάθείς	 [máthis]	 or	 μαθαίνεις	
    [mathénis]	 …	 (we	 could	 have	 either	 –	 again,	 it	 just	 depends	 on	 the	 imagination,	
    no,	 what	 you	 are	 referring	 to	 in	 your	 mind)	 …	 αν	 τις	 μαθαίνεις	 [an	 tis	 mathénis	
    σωστά],	αν	τις	μάθείς	σωστά	[an	tis	máthis	sostá].	Very	good.		
	
	 “The	method”,	the	method,	in	Greek	is,	η	μέθοδος	[i	méthodhos].	Η	μέθοδος.		
	
S:	 Η	μέθοδος.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	an	[os]	(-ος)	noun,	no,	which	is	feminine.	Η	μέθοδος.	We	saw,	η	έξοδος	[i	
    éksodhos]	–	“the	exit”;	also	an	[os]	(-ος)	noun	that’s	feminine.	So,	σωστά	[sostá]	
    was	“correctly”,	no,	but	just	“correct”,	is	σωστός	[sostós].	Σωστός.		
	
S:	 Σωστός.		


                                                                                               371
	
T:	 And	how	would	that	be	in	the	feminine?		
	
S:	 Σώστη	[sósti].		
	
T:	 Σωστή	[sostí].	Very	good.	The	correct	method.	How	do	you	think	you	would	say,	
    The	correct	method	(the	right	method)?		
	
S:	 Η	σώστη	μέθοδο	…	μέθοδος	[i	sostí	méthodho	…	méthodhos].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Η	σώστη	μέθοδος	[i	sostí	méthodhos].	So,	μέθοδος	[méthodhos]	ends	
    [os]	(ος),	but	it’s	feminine,	so	we	use	σωστή	[sostí],	with	the	feminine	ending:	Η	
    σωστή	μέθοδος.	And	we	keep	the	S	(ς),	no,	it’s	not	in	“him”	or	“her”	position.	So,	
    η	σωστή	μέθοδος	[i	sostí	méthodhos].	How	would	you	say,	All	languages	are	easy	
    with	the	right	method?	All	languages	are	easy	with	the	right	method.		
	
S:	 Όλες	 οι	 γλώσσες	 είναι	 εύκολες	 με	 την	 σώστη	 μέθοδο	 [óles	 i	 ghlóses	 íne	 éfkoles	
    me	tin	sostí	méthodho].		
	
T:	 Very,	 very	 good.	 Όλες	 οι	 γλώσσες	 είναι	 εύκολες	 με	 την	 …	 [óles	 i	 ghlóses	 íne	
    éfkoles	me	tin	…]	(because	it’s	“with	her”,	rather	than	“with	she”)	…	με	την	σωστή	
    μέθοδο	[…	me	tin	sostí	méthodho].	And	μέθοδος	[méthodhos]	loses	the	S	(ς),	no?	
    It’s	 an	 [os]	 (-ος)	 noun,	 behaving	 like	 “him”,	 rather	 than	 “he”,	 like	 “her”,	 rather	
    than	 “she”,	 so	 we	 lose	 that	 S	 (ς).	 Όλες	 οι	 γλώσσες	 είναι	 εύκολες	 με	 την	 σώστη	
    μέθοδο	[óles	i	ghlóses	íne	éfkoles	me	tin	sostí	méthodho].	And	you	could	reverse	
    those	two	parts	as	well,	just	like	in	English.	With	the	right	method	all	languages	
    are	 easy.	 Με	 την	 σωστή	 μέθοδο	 όλες	 οι	 γλώσσες	 είναι	 εύκολες	 [me	 tin	 sostí	
    méthodho	óles	i	ghlóses	íne	éfkoles].		
	
	 So	 we	 have,	 σωστός	 meaning	 “right”	 or	 “correct”,	 and,	 you	 know,	 the	 possible	
    versions	of	that:	σωστή,	σωστό,	σωστού,	σωστούς	[sostí,	sostó,	sostú,	sostús],	like	
    in,	 σωστή	 μέθοδος	 [sostí	 méthodhos].	 You	 might	 hear	 “σωστό”	 [sostó]	 in	
    conversation,	when	somebody	agrees,	like,	Σωστό!	What	gender	is	this	σωστό?		
	
S:	 Masculine.	No.	It’s	neuter.		
	
T:	 It’s	neuter,	and	why	is	it	neuter	when	you	just	say,	you	know,	σωστό,	to	agree?		
	
S:	 Well	it’s,	“It	is	right”.	If	it	was	masculine,	it	would	keep	its	S	(ς).		
	
T:	 But	if	what	were	masculine?		
	
S:	 If	the	σωσ	[sos]	...	if	the	thing	…		
	
T:	 Exactly,	there	is	actually	nothing	here	that	we	can	ask	if	it’s	masculine	or	feminine	
    or	neuter.	And	the	neuter	also	serves	this	role,	no?	So	when	we,	when	we	don’t	
    know	what	we	are	referring	to,	we’re	not	referring	to	any	object	or	person	that	


                                                                                               372
   we	 can	 put	 a	 gender	 to,	 we	 use	 the	 neuter.	 Σωστό	 [sostó].	 But	 when	 we	 said	
   “correctly”,	we	said,	σωστά	[sostá].	No?	So	usually,	to	get	this	“-ly”	that	we	have	
   in	English,	like	“correct-ly”,	we	use	Α	(α),	in	Greek,	or	the	neuter	plural,	let’s	say.	
   So,	for	example,	γενικός	[yenikós]	is	“general”.	Γενικός.		
	
S:	 Γενικός.	
	
T:	 This	 is	 the	 γάμα	 [gháma]	 (γ),	 no,	 softened	 by	 the	 [e]	 sound	 –	 γενικός	 [yenikós].	
    And	we	could	have	the	different	versions	–	γενικηή,	γενικό	[yenikí,	yenikó].	But	if	
    we	want	to	say	“generally”,	we	will	use	the	neuter	plural.	We	will	add	an	A	(α).	So,	
    generally?		
	
S:	 Γενικά	[yeniká].		
	
T:	 Γενικά.	Generally	I	learn	well.		
	
S:	 Γενικά	μαθαίνω	καλά	[yeniká	mathéno	kalá].		
	
T:	 Γενικά	μαθαίνω	καλά.	What	was,	easy?		
	
S:	 Εύκολο	[éfkolo].		
	
T:	 Εύκολο.	 So,	 you	 know,	 it’s	 not	 so	 important	 if	 you	 give	 me	 εύκολος	 [éfkolos]	 or	
    εύκολο	[éfkolo],	as	long	as	we	know,	you	know	that:	Okay,	that’s	the	neuter	and	
    that’s	the	masculine.	So,	εύκολο	–	“easy”.	Easily?		
	
S:	 Εύκολα	[éfkola].		
	
T:		Εύκολα.	Good.	We	have	“basic”,	which	is,	βασικός	[vasikós].	Bασικός.		
	
S:	 Bασικός.		
	
T:	 Here	we	have	a	V	sound,	no,	not	like	the	“basic”	in	English.	But	of	course	that	V	
    looks	 like	 a	 “b”	 in	 Greek	 (β/B).	 So	 we	 could	 have	 βασικός,	 that’s	 the	 masculine;	
    the	neuter	–	βασικό	[vasikó],	the	feminine	–	βασική	[vasikí];	the	plural	feminine	–	
    βασικές	[vasikés].	But	if	we	want	to	get,	basically,	what	do	we	do?		
	
S:	 We	add	an	A	(α).	So,	βασικά	[vasiká].		
	
T:	 Βασικά.	 Good.	 So	 we’ve	 seen	 how	 describing	 words	 change	 for	 gender,	 for	
    number,	 and	 also	 for	 case,	 no	 –	 meaning	 whether	 they’re	 behaving	 like	 “he”	 or	
    “him”,	“they”	or	“them”,	for	example.	We	could	have	“sure”	or	“certain”,	which	is	
    σίγουρος	[síghuros].	Σίγουρος.		
	
S:	 Σίγουρος.		
	
T:		So	that	means	“sure”	or	“certain”,	like	“secure”,	in	English.	Σίγουρος.		


                                                                                              373
	
S:	 Σίγουρος.		
	
T:	 If	you	want	to	say,	Are	you	sure?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	σίγουρος;	[íse	síghuros?].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	σίγουρος;	Αnd	to	a	woman?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	σίγουρη;	[íse	síghuri?].		
	
T:		Είσαι	σίγουρη;	And	what	was	the	plural,	You	are?	So,	είσαι	[íse]	is,	“you	are”,	for	
    one	person.	And	then	we	had	another	one,	which	is	plural	or	formal.		
	
S:	 Είστε	[íste].		
	
T:	 Είστε,	είστε.	And	also	we	could	have,	είσαστε	[ísaste].	Είσαστε.	Είστε	or	είσαστε	
    for	“you”	formal,	or	“you”	plural,	“are”.	And	in	both	of	those	cases	we	have	[te]	
    (τε)	 on	 the	 end,	 which	 is	 like	 the	 “ετε”	 [ete]	 that	 we	 usually	 add,	 no?	 Θέλεις,	
    θέλετε	 [thélis,	 thélete];	 είσαι,	 είστε	 or	 είσαστε	 [íse,	 íste,	 ísaste].	 So	 how	 would	
    you	say,	Αre	you	(plural)	sure?		
	
S:	 Είστε	σίγουροι;	[íste	síghuri?].		
	
T:	 Είστε	σίγουροι;	So	this	is	the	masculine,	no,	ending,	OI	(οι),	and	we	can	use	this	
    for	masculine	groups	or	groups	of	mixed	gender.	And	what	if	we	were	to	say,	Αre	
    you	sure?	–	and	we	were	talking	to	three	women.		
	
S:	 Είστε	σίγουρες;	[íste	síghures?].		
	
T:	 Είστε	 σίγουρες;	 But	 if	 you	 just	 say,	 like,	 for	 sure,	 surely	 –	 you	 can	 do	 that	 in	
    conversation	in	Greek.	How	would,	surely	be?		
	
S:	 Σίγουρα	[síghura].		
	
T:		Σίγουρα.	So,	if	you	don’t	say,	Are	you	sure?,	but	you	just	say,	For	sure,	sure.	What	
    you	 actually	 say	 is,	 surely	 –	 σίγουρα	 [síghura].	 And	 you	 might	 also	 say	 that	
    affirmatively,	 as	 well,	 not	 necessarily	 as	 a	 question	 –	 σίγουρα	 –	 like	 when	 you	
    agree:	σίγουρα.

Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	new,	like	in	“neo-colonialism”?		
	
Student:	Νέος	[néos].		
	
Τ:	 Νέος,	 the	 masculine,	 νέος.	 We	 could	 also	 have	 καινούργιος	 [kenúrios].	
    Καινούργιος	is	often	heard	in	conversation	for	“new”,	as	well.		
	
S:	 Καινούργιος.		
	
T:	 The	word	for,	big?		
	
S:	 Μεγάλος	[meghálos].		
	
T:	 Μεγάλος.	And,	as	we’ve	mentioned,	νέος	[néos]	–	“new”,	can	mean	“young”,	and	
    μεγάλος	–	“big”,	can	mean	“old”,	as	well.	“Sure”,	or	“certain”,	related	to	“secure”	
    in	English?		
	
S:	 Σίγουρος	[síghuros].		
	
T:	 Σίγουρος.	General,	generic?		
	
S:	 Γενικός	[yenikós].		
	
T:	 Difficult?		
	
S:	 Δύσκολος	[dhískolos].		
	
T:	 Δύσκολος.	So	this	is	like,	you	know,	un-digesting	or	something	like	this.	And,	easy?		
	
S:	 Εύκολος	[éfkolos].		
	
T:	 Εύκολος.	 Good	 digesting.	 So	 these	 are	 adjectives,	 describing	 words,	 and	 like	
    nouns,	 they	 changed,	 no?	 But	 also	 we	 can	 get	 words	 like,	 “generally”,	 “surely”,	
    “easily”,	from	them.	So	γενικός	[yenikós]	is	“general”	or	“generic”,	and,	generally?		
	
	S:	Γενικά	[yeniká].		
	
T:	 Γενικά.	We	have,	σίγουρος	[síghuros],	“sure”	or	“certain”,	and,	surely,	certainly?		
	
S:	 Σίγουρα	[síghura].		
	
T:	 Σίγουρα.	How	would	you	say,	easily?		
	
S:	 Εύκολα	[éfkola].		
	


                                                                                          375
T:	 Εύκολα.	 So	 these	 “-ly”	 words	 are	 a	 certain	 type	 of	 describing	 word,	 that	 don’t	
    change	as	the	other	describing	words	do,	because	they	are	not	thought	to	refer	to	
    any	noun,	but	to	the	verb.	We	have	a	form	to	get	them,	with	the	A	(α)	ending,	and	
    then,	that’s	it;	they	don’t	change	any	more.	They	stay	as	they	are.	We	don’t	have	
    to	work	out	who	or	what	they	refer	to,	or	how	they	should	change.		
	
	 “I	finish”	was,	τελειώνω	[telióno].	Τελειώνω.		
	
S:	 Τελειώνω.		
	
T:	 Τελειώνω.	How	would	you	say,	Basically	he	wants	to	finish	it?		
	
S:	 Βασικά	θέλει	να	το	τελειώσει	[basiká	théli	na	to	teliósi].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	be	careful	not	to	carry	over	that	[b]	from	English.	Βασικά	θέλει	να	το	
    τελειώσει	[vasiká	théli	na	to	teliósi].		
	
S:	 Βασικά	θέλει	να	το	τελειώσει	[vasiká	théli	na	to	teliósi].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	We	saw	briefly	“quickly”,	as	well,	like	the	name	“Gregory”	–	Γρηγόριος	
    [ghrighórios].	 Γρήγορα	 [ghríghora]	 –	 “quickly”.	 So	 again,	 “quickly”,	 ending	 “-ly”,	
    and	in	Greek,	ending	in	A	(α).	Γρήγορα.		
	
S:	 Γρήγορα.		
	
T:	 Basically,	they	want	to	finish	it	quickly.	Basically,	they	want	to	finish	it	quickly.		
	
S:	 Βασικά	 θέλουνε	 να	 το	 τελειώσουν	 γρήγορα	 [vasiká	 thélune	 na	 to	 teliósun	
    ghríghora].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Βασικά	 θέλουν	 (θέλουνε)	 να	 το	 τελειώσουν	 (να	 το	 τελειώσουνε)	
    γρήγορα	 [vasiká	 thélun	 (thélune)	 na	 to	 teliósun	 (na	 to	 teliósune)	 ghríghora].	 So,	
    βασικά	 [vasiká]	 –	 “basically”,	 you	 hear	 quite	 a	 lot	 in	 conversation	 in	 Greek.	 It’s	
    quite	common	to	start	a	sentence,	maybe	to	give	a	second	to	think,	and	put	the	
    sentence	together:	Bασικά	...		
	
	 There	 are	 also	 some	 other	 words	 which	 you	 may	 not	 expect	 to	 fit	 into	 this	
    category,	because	they	don’t	end	“-ly”,	in	English.	What	was	the	word	for,	good?		
	
S:	 Καλό	[kaló].		
	
T:	 Καλό,	the	neuter,	no,	or	καλός,	καλή	[kalós,	kalí],	etc.	But	the	word	for,	well,	was?		
	
S:	 Καλά	[kalá].		
	




                                                                                               376
T:	 So,	καλά	–	well,	is	a	little	like	“good-ly”,	no?	But	it	doesn’t	end	“-ly”	in	English,	no,	
    “well”,	 but	 this	 is	 the	 idea.	 Καλά	 [kalá]	 is	 like	 “good-ly”;	 so	 actually	 it	 doesn’t	
    change	for	the	person.	How	do	you	say,	I’m	well?		
	
S:	 Είμαι	καλά	[íme	kalá].		
	
T:	 Είμαι	καλά.	If	you	are	male	or	female	you	will	say,	είμαι	καλά.	No?	Are	you	well?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	καλά;	[íse	kalá?].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	καλά;	Are	you	guys	well?		
	
S:	 Είστε	καλά;	[íste	kalá?].		
	
T:	 Είστε	καλά;	And	you	don’t	have	to	change	“καλά”	for	gender,	for	number,	for	the	
    plural,	for	anything,	because	it’s	like	“good-ly”,	“well-ly”	–	something	like	this.	If	
    we	 do	 change	 this	 word	 to	 match	 the	 person,	 it’s	 not	 going	 to	 mean	 “well”	
    anymore;	it’s	going	to	mean	“good”.	So,	if	you	want	to	say,	You	guys	are	good?		
	
S:	 Είστε	καλοί.	[íste	kalí].		
	
T:	 Είστε	καλοί.	Or	for	females?		
	
S:	 Είστε	καλές.	[íste	kalés].		
	
T:	 Είστε	 καλές.	 So	 here	 it’s	 changing,	 because	 it	 means	 “good”,	 not	 “well”.	 How	
    would	you	say,	better,	in	the	sense	of,	more	good?		
	
S:	 Πιο	καλό	[pyo	kaló].		
	
T:	 Πιο	καλό,	or	καλύτερο	[kalítero],	no,	we	could	have.	Καλύτερο.	So	this	is	“better”,	
    as	 in	 “more	 good”,	 if	 we	 say,	 for	 example,	 This	 is	 better	 than	 that.	 No?	 This	 is	
    more	good	than	that.	So	how	would	you	say	that:	This	is	better	than	that;	This	one	
    is	better	than	that	one?	And	let’s	talk	about	the	neuter	thing.		
	
S:	 Αυτό	είναι	καλύτερο	από	εκείνο	[aftó	íne	kalítero	apó	ekíno].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτό	είναι	καλύτερο	από	εκείνο.	And	what	if	you	were	talking	about	a	
    masculine	thing?	First	give	me	the	first	bit:	This	one	is	better,	a	masculine	thing.		
	
S:	 Αυτός	είναι	καλύτερος	[aftós	íne	kalíteros].		
	
T:	 	Very	 good.	 Αυτός	 είναι	 καλύτερος	 ...	 than	 that	 one.	 So	 what	 we	 actually	 say	 is,	
    “from	 that	 one”;	 and	 we’ve	 been	 seeing	 with,	 like,	 από	 [apó],	 σε	 [se],	 για	 [ya],	
    when	 we	 have	 a	 word	 like	 “from”,	 “to”,	 “for”,	 no,	 afterwards	 we	 have	 “him”	
    rather	than	“he”;	we	have	“them”	rather	than	“they”.	So	we	need	to	think	about	
    how	 we	 would	 change	 εκείνος	 [ekínos].	 Generally,	 no,	 masculine	 nouns	 and	


                                                                                                377
   adjectives	–	we	drop	the	S	(ς)	when	they’re	behaving	like	“him”	rather	than	“he”;	
   but	some	other	words,	a	few	other	words,	behave	more	like	the	word	for	“the”.	
   So,	rather	than	dropping	the	S	(ς),	what	might	happen	to	εκείνος	[ekínos]?		
	
S:	 We	exchange	the	S	(ς)	with	an	N	(ν).		
	
T:	 Good.	It	will	take	an	N	(ν),	like	τον	[ton].	No?	So	how	would	you	say	that:	This	one	
    is	better	than	that	one	–	masculine?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	είναι	καλύτερος	από	εκείνον	[aftós	íne	kalíteros	apó	ekínon].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Αυτός	 είναι	 καλύτερος	 από	 εκείνον.	 So	 some	 of	 these	 words	 that	
    function	 more	 like	 “the”,	 no,	 or	 “a”,	 they	 will	 behave	 in	 a	 slightly	 different	 way,	
    taking	an	N	(ν)	in	the	masculine	singular,	no,	when	it’s	like	“him”	rather	than	“he”.	
    How	 would	 you	 say,	 These	 ones	 are	 better	 than	 those	 ones,	 and	 you	 mean	
    masculine	things?		
	
S:	 Αυτοί	είναι	καλύτεροι	από	εκείνους	[aftí	íne	kalíteri	apó	ekínus].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Αυτοί	 είναι	 καλύτεροι	 από	 εκείνους.	 So	 here,	 εκείνος	 [ekínos],	 it’s	 still	
    acting	like	the	word	“the”,	like	τους	[tus],	but	you	would	never	notice	because	the	
    adjectives	do	the	same	thing	anyway;	they	also	go	“-ους”	[-us].	So	here	it	doesn’t	
    cause	any	problem	for	us.	But	with	the	masculine	singular,	especially,	you	know,	
    with	 some	 words	 we’re	 going	 to	 have	 a	 difference,	 between	 dropping	 that	 S	 (ς)	
    for	the	adjective	or	the	noun,	and	putting	the	N	(ν),	because	it’s	a	word	like	“the”.	
	
	 So	 καλύτερος	 [kalíteros]	 is	 “better”,	 like	 “more	 good”,	 no?	 But	 “better”,	 as	 in	
    “more	 well”,	 no,	 like,	 I	 don’t	 know,	 if	 you’ve	 been	 unwell	 and	 somebody	 says,	
    “Are	you	better?”,	no,	“Are	you	more	well?”,	then	it’s	not	going	to	be	καλύτερος	
    [kalíteros]	any	more,	but	...	?		
	
S:	 Καλύτερα	[kalítera].		
	
T:	 Καλύτερα.	 No?	 So	 we’ll	 have	 to	 think	 then	 in	 Greek	 what	 we	 actually	 mean,	
    because	in	English	we	don’t	have	a	difference.	“Better”	is	used	for	something	that	
    is	 better	 than	 something	 else,	 and	 being	 better	 after	 being	 unwell,	 as	 well.	 So,	
    how	would	you	say,	Are	you	better?,	Are	you	better-ly?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	καλύτερα;	[íse	kalítera?].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	καλύτερα;	Are	you	guys	better?		
	
S:	 Είστε	καλύτερα;	[íste	kalítera?].		
	
T:	 Είστε	καλύτερα;	We	are	better.		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	καλύτερα	[ímaste	kalítera].		


                                                                                                378
	
T:	 Είμαστε	 καλύτερα.	 So	 when	 we	 have	 καλά	 [kalá]	 –	 “well”,	 καλύτερα	 [kalítera]	 –	
    “better”,	you	know,	we	don’t	have	to	think	about	changing	καλά,	καλύτερα.	But	if	
    we	were	to	say,	We	are	better,	in	the	sense	of	“more	good”,	like,	We	are	better	
    than	them,	then	we	will	change	it.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	καλύτεροι	[ímaste	kalíteri].		
	
T:	 Είμαστε	καλύτεροι	...	than	them?		
	
S:	 Από	αυτούς	[apó	aftús].		
	
T:	 Good.	Από	αυτούς.	We	have	αυτοί	[aftí],	no,	for	“they”,	and	then	“them”,	αυτούς	
    [aftús].	Good.	So,	Είμαστε	καλύτεροι	από	αυτούς	[ímaste	kalíteri	apó	aftús].	We	
    are	better	than	them.	We	are	the	best.	How	would	you	say	that?	We	are	the	best.		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	οι	καλύτεροι	[ímaste	i	kalíteri].		
	
T:	 Είμαστε	οι	καλύτεροι.	Very	good.

Complete	Greek,	Track	79	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	So	“Greek”	was	Ελληνικά	[eliniká],	no,	the	language,	Ελληνικά.	And	this	is	
    something	like	“Hellenics”,	“the	Hellenics”	–	Ta	Ελληνικά	[ta	eliniká]	–	like	neuter	
    plural	 nouns	 together	 to	 get	 the	 language:	 τα	 Ελληνικά.	 But,	 Ελληνικά,	 or	
    Ελληνικό,	Ελλνικός,	Ελληνική	[elinikó,	elinikós,	elinikí]	can	also	be	an	adjective	to	
    say	 something	 is	 Greek.	 For	 example,	 Ελληνικά	 προϊόντα	 [eliniká	 proiónda].	
    Ελληνικά	προϊόντα	–	“Greek	produce”.	So	actually,	you	will	find	a	few	adjectives	
    ending	[ik]	(“-ic”),	in	English,	and	“-ικο”	[-iko],	or	“-ικος,	ικa”	[-ikos,	-ika],	etc.,	in	
    Greek,	like	“Hellenic”	–	Eλληνικός	[elinikós].		
	
	 We	saw	“basic”,	no,	which	is,	βασικός	[vasikós]	and,	basically?		
	
Student:	Βασικά	[vasiká].		
	
T:	 Βασικά.	We	saw,	general,	or	generic,	which	was?		
	
S:	 Γενικός	[yenikós].		
	
T:	 Γενικός.	 Good.	 So	 there	 we	 have	 the	 [ik]	 of	 generic,	 no?	 Not	 in,	 general,	 but	
    generic.	Γενικός.	Generally?		
	
S:	 Γενικά	[yeniká].		
	
T:	 Γενικά.	Ιn	English	we	have	“semantics”	–	semantic,	which	pertains	to	“meaning”,	
    no?	 Σημαντικός	 [simandikós]	 in	 Greek	 means	 “important”,	 like	 “meaningful”.	
    Σημαντικός	–	“important”.		
	
S:	 Σημαντικός.		
	
T:	 We	have,	φυσικός	[fizikós],	which	means	“natural”,	like	“physical”.	No?	Φυσικός.		
	
S:	 Φυσικός.		
	
T:	 “Natural”	–	φυσικός.	We	have,	η	φύση	[i	fízi],	“the	nature”.	How	would	you	say,	
    naturally?		
	
S:	 Φυσικά	[fiziká].		
	
T:	 Φυσικά.	 This	 is	 used	 like,	 “of	 course”.	 Φυσικά	 –	 “of	 course”;	 and	 it’s	 used	 very	
    often	as	well	in	Greek.	I	arrive,	was?		
	
S:	 Φτάνω	[ftáno].		
	
T:	 Φτάνω,	φτάνω.	And	“the	centre”,	the	centre,	in	Greek,	is	το	κέντρο	[to	kéndro],	or	
    το	 κέντρο	 [to	 kédro];	 you	 can	 hear	 both.	 You	 can	 hear	 it	 like	 ND	 or	 like	 D.	 Το	
    κέντρο,	το	κέντρο	[to	kéndro,	to	kédro].	So	this	is	spelt	K	(κ)	-	E	(ε)	-	N	(ν),	which	


                                                                                               380
   looks	like	a	“v”,	no	-	T	(τ),	it’s	spelt	with	the	T	(τ)	-	R(ρ)	-	O	(ο).	So	NT	(ντ)	together,	
   inside	of	a	word	is	going	to	give	us	a	D	[d],	or	an	ND	[nd],	not	a	T	[t].	Το	κέντρο	[to	
   kéndro],	or	το	κέντρο	[to	kédro],	not	[to	kéntro].		
	
	S:	Το	κέντρο	[to	kéndro].		
	
T:	 To	the	centre,	or,	At	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Στο	κέντρο	[sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Στο	 κέντρο.	 Naturally	 (of	 course,	 or	 maybe	 more	 literally,	 physically,	 no?),	
    naturally	 they	 will	 arrive	 at	 the	 centre	 (they	 will	 arrive	 to	 the	 centre).	 Naturally	
    they	will	arrive	at	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Φυσικά	θα	φτάσουν	στο	κέντρο	[fiziká	tha	ftásun	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Φυσικά	 θα	 φτάσουν	 στο	 κέντρο.	 So	 this	 is	 like,	 Of	 course,	 of	 course,	 they	 will	
    arrive	at	the	centre.	Φυσικά	θα	φτάσουν	στο	κέντρο.	How	do	you	think	centric,	or	
    central	might	be?		
	
S:	 Κεντρικό	[kendrikó].		
	
T:	 Κεντρικό,	κεντρικός	[kendrikós].	Centrally?		
	
S:	 Κεντρικά	[kendriká].		
	
T:	 Κεντρικά.	 So	 a	 lot	 of	 “-ic”	 adjectives,	 which	 we	 can	 move	 over	 to	 Greek,	 even	 if	
    there	 are	 not	 the	 most	 common	 ones	 we	 would	 think	 of,	 you	 know.	 We	 have	
    “general”,	but	then	“generic”	and	γενικός	[yenikós];	“central”,	and	then	“centric”	
    and	κεντρικός	[kendrikós].	But	we	can’t	do	this	with	all	“-ic”	adjectives	in	English,	
    no?	 We’ll	 just	 notice	 some	 correspondences,	 and	 as	 we’ve	 seen,	 the	 meaning	
    won’t	 always	 be	 the	 same,	 but	 related:	 like	 “physical”	 and	 “natural”	 –	 φυσικός	
    [fizikós],	“natural”.		
	
	 Ένα	μυστικό	[éna	mistikó]	is	“a	secret”.	Ένα	μυστικό.	And	you	could	also	have	the	
    adjective,	 μυστικός,	 μυστικό,	 μυστική	 [mistikós,	 mistikó,	 mistikí],	 to	 mean	
    “secret”.	You	know,	when	you	describe	something	as	secret,	like	a	secret	door,	for	
    example.	H	μυστική	πόρτα	[i	mistikí	pórta]	–	“the	secret	door”.	Secretly?		
	
S:	 Μυστικά	[mistiká].

T:	 Classic,	 classical.	 And	 we	 also	 have	 many	 “-ικο”	 [-iko]	 adjectives	 in	 Greek	 that	
    don’t	translate.	So	adding	“-ικο”		onto	something	is	a	very	common	way	to	get	an	
    adjective	in	Greek.	So,	for	example,	we	could	have	σπιτικός	[spitikós].	Σπιτικός.	If	
    σπίτι	[spíti]	means	“house”	or	“home”,	what	might	σπιτικός	mean?		
	
S:	 Homic?	Homic?		
	
T:	 “Homic”?		
	
S:	 Like,	with,	you	know,	it’s	in	the	home,	you	know,	something	...		
	
T:	 And	 what,	 what	 do	 you	 think	 it	 might	 be	 used	 for?	 Okay,	 you	 get	 the	 general	
    feeling,	 and	 then	 you	 can	 think	 about	 real	 life	 and	 how	 that	 might	 apply	 to	 real	
    life.	And	then	to	find	the	word	in	English.		
	
S:	 Something	that	is	in	the	home.		
	
T:	 “Home-made”.		
	
S:	 Okay.	Home-made.		
	
T:	 We	want	something	home-made.		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	κάτι	σπιτικό	[thélume	káti	spitikó].		
	
T:	 Θέλουμε	κάτι	σπιτικό.	No?	So	we	have,	σπιτικό	[spitikó]	–	“home-made”,	and	you	
    will	 find	 a	 lot	 of	 “-ικο”	 [iko]	 adjectives	 in	 Greek,	 and	 also	 nouns.	 Ένας	 μουσικός	
    [énas	 muzikós]	 is	 a	 musician.	 Ένας	 μουσικός.	 Or,	 μουσικός,	 like	 an	 adjective,	 to	
    mean	“musical”.		
	
	 So	we	know	how	to	handle	describing	words	in	Greek,	which	change	in	the	same	
    way	 as	 nouns	 change	 for	 gender	 and	 number,	 etc.	 But	 we’ve	 also	 seen	 a	 set	 of	
    describing	 words	 kind	 of	 doing	 their	 own	 thing,	 and	 these	 mostly	 end	 “-ly”	 in	
    English,	and	A	(α)	in	Greek:	like	“generally”	–	γενικά	[yeniká];	“secretly”	–	μυστικά	
    [mistiká].	But	not	always.	We	saw	καλά	[kalá],	no,	which	means	“well”,	and	“well”	
    doesn’t	end	“-ly”	in	English.	We	also	have,	μακρύς	[makrís],	which	means	“long”,	
    and	 then,	 μακριά	 [makriá],	 which	 means	 “far”	 or	 “far	 away”,	 like	 “far-ly”,	 no?	
    Something	 like	 that.	 But	 the	 important	 thing	 to	 understand	 is	 that	 it	 doesn’t	
    change,	no?	So	when	you	come	across	a	describing	word	that’s	not	changing,	and	
    it	ends	in	A	(α),	you	know	why.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	I’m	far	(I’m	far	away)?	“Far”	
    was	μακριά	[makriá].	So,	I’m	far	(I’m	far	away)?		
	
S:	 Είμαι	μακριά	[íme	makriá].		
	
T:	 Είμαι	μακριά,	for	any	gender.	And,	We	are	far?		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	μακριά	[ímaste	makriá].		


                                                                                                382
	
T:	 Είμαστε	μακριά.	No?	Είμαστε	μακριά.	The	centre	is	far.		
	
S:	 Το	κέντρο	είναι	μακριά	[to	kéndro	íne	makriá].		
	
T:	 Το	 κέντρο,	 το	 κέντρο,	 είναι	 μακριά	 [to	 kéndro,	 to	 kédro,	 íne	 makriá].	 Κοντός	
    [kondós],	or	κοντός	[kodós]	–	this	is	also	spelt	with	ΝΤ	(ντ)	in	the	middle,	so	we	
    can	 have	 κοντός	 [kodós]	 or	 κοντός	 [kondós]	 –	 means	 “short”,	 short.	 Κοντός	
    [kondós]	or	κοντός	[kodós];	κοντός	[kondós],	κοντός	[kodós].		
	
S:	 Κοντός	[kondós].		
	
T:	 And	we	can	get	the	word	for	“close”	or	“close	by”	from	κοντός	–	“short”.	So	how	
    do	you	think	you	might	get	that?		
	
S:	 Κοντά	[kondá].		
	
T:	 Κοντά.	Νο?		So	 we	 have,	 μακριά	 [makriá]	 from	 μακρύς	 [makrís],	 which	 means	
    “long”.	And	we	have,	κοντά	[kondá]	from	κοντός	[kondós],	which	means	“short”.	
    And	then	we	get	“close”	or	“close	by”.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	It	is	close	(it	is	close	
    by)?		
	
S:	 Είναι	κοντά	[íne	kondá].		
	
T:	 Είναι	κοντά.	So	we	have	“close”,	no,	and	“far”,	neither	ending	“-ly”	in	English,	but	
    they	fit	into	this	group	of	describing	words	that	end	in	Α	(α),	and	don’t	change	to	
    match	anybody.	We	are	close.	We	are	close	by.		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	κοντά	[ímaste	kondá].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Είμαστε	 κοντά.	 Κοντά	 είμαστε	 [kondá	 ímaste].	 And	 if	 you	 change	 κοντά	
    [kondá]	to	match	είμαστε	[ímaste]?	Firstly,	how	will	it	sound?		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	κοντοί	[ímaste	kondí].		
	
T:	 Είμαστε	κοντοί.	And	what	will	it	mean?		
	
S:	 We	are	short.		
	
T:	 We	 are	 short.	 Good.	 So	 you	 get	 a	 different	 meaning.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 The	
    centre	is	close	by?		
	
S:	 Το	κέντρο	είναι	κοντά	[to	kéndro	íne	kondá].		
	
T:	 Το	κέντρο	είναι	κοντά.	Είναι	κοντά	το	κέντρο	[íne	kondá	to	kéndro].	Very	good.

Teacher:	 We	 saw	 μακρύς	 [makrís],	 which	 means	 “long”,	 and	 then,	 μακριά	 [makriá]	
    gives	us	“far”,	or	“far	away”.		
	
Student:	Μακριά.		
	
T:	 	If	you	want	to	say,	“far	from	me”,	you	will	say,	μακριά	μου	[makriá	mu].	Μακριά	
    μου.		
	
S:	 Μακριά	μου.		
	
T:	 So	 there	 we	 have,	 μου	 [mu],	 like	 “from	 me”.	 No?	 So	 we	 said	 there	 we	 had,	 με	
    [me]	for	“me”,	and	then	μου	[mu]	–	“to	me”,	and	occasionally	like,	“for	me”,	or	
    “on	me”,	and	here	like,	“from	me”.	Μακριά	μου	–	“far	from	me”.	Far	from	you?

T:	 Μακριά	 σου.	 We	 saw	 κοντός	 [kondós],	 which	 means	 “short”.	 Κοντός.	 And	 the

T:	 Είμαστε	μακριά	τους.	Good.	And	in	all	of	that,	μακριά	doesn’t	have	to	change	to	
    match	anybody.	It	is	just,	μακριά	–	“far”	or	“far	away”.		
	
	 “A	little”	was,	λίγο	[lígho].	Λίγο.		
	
S:	 Λίγο.		
	
T:	 This	is	like,	L	(λ/Λ)	-	Ι	(ι)	-	γάμα	[gháma]	(γ)	-	O	(ο).	Λίγο	[lígho].		
	
S:	 Λίγο.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	a	little	far?		
	
S:	 Λίγο	μακριά	[lígho	makriá].		
	
T:	 Λίγο	 μακριά.	 So	 actually,	 when	 I	 say,	 λίγο	 [lígho],	 I	 give	 you	 the	 neuter	 version.	
    You	could	also	have,	λίγος	[líghos]	to	mean	“a	bit	of”,	no	–	“a	little	of”	something	
    masculine.	 But,	 you	 know,	 mostly	 we	 will	 be	 using	 this	 in	 the	 neuter,	 especially	
    because	 we	 use	 it	 to	 refer	 to	 other	 describing	 words.	 So	 if	 we	 say	 “a	 little	 far”,	
    what	gender	should	we	have?		
	
S:	 The	neuter.		
	
T:	 The	neuter.	We’re	not	referring	to	anything	we	can	put	a	gender	on,	no?	So,	λίγο	
    μακριά.	We	are	a	little	far.		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	λίγο	μακριά	[ímaste	lígho	makriá].		
	
T:	 Είμαστε	λίγο	μακριά.	Basically	we	are	a	little	far	away.		
	
S:	 Βασικά	είμαστε	λίγο	μακριά	[vasiká	ímaste	lígho	makriá].		
	
T:	 Βασικά	είμαστε	λίγο	μακριά.	We	are	a	little	far	in	order	to	arrive	today.	So	this,	“in	
    order”,	is	just,	“so	that”,	that	we	said	that	we	could	build	with,	για	να	[ya	na].	Για	
    να	gives	us	“so	that”,	“in	order	to”.	So	let’s	try	this.	We	are	a	little	far	in	order	to	
    arrive	today.		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	λίγο	μακριά	για	να	φτάσουμε	σήμερα	[ímaste	lígho	makriá	ya	na	ftásume

T:	 Very	good.	Είμαστε	λίγο	μακριά	για	να	φτάσουμε	σήμερα.	So,	“so	that”,	“in	order	
    to”	–	για	να	[ya	na].		
	
	 We	saw,	κουρασμένος	[kurazménos]	–	this	means	“tired”,	and	we	also	noted	how	
    there’s	a	big	group	of	adjectives	ending	“-μενος”	[ménos].	Kουρασμένος	–	“tired”.		
	
S:	 Κουρασμένος.		


                                                                                                 385
	
T:	 We	are	a	little	tired?		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	λίγο	κουρασμένοι	[ímaste	lígho	kurazméni].		
	
T:	 Good.	Είμαστε	λίγο	κουρασμένοι	–	for	a	masculine	or	mixed	group.	Or	if	you	were	
    all	females?		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	λίγο	κουρασμένες	[ímaste	lígho	kurazménes].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Είμαστε	 λίγο	 κουρασμένες.	 So,	 λιγο	 [lígho]	 is	 in	 the	 neuter,	 no?	 It’s	 just	
    affecting	 another	 adjective,	 so	 we	 put	 it	 in	 neuter:	 λίγο	 κουρασμένος	 [lígho	
    kurazménos];	 λίγο	 κουασμένοι	 [lígho	 kurazméni];	 λίγο	 κουρασμένες	 [lígho	
    kurazménes].	 All	 with	 λίγο.	 And	 we	 saw	 the	 same	 with	 “πιο”	 [pyo],	 as	 well,	 the	
    word	for	“more”	–	πιο.	So	how	would	you	say,	for	example,	more	tired?		
	
S:	 Πιο	κουρασμένος	[pyo	kurazménos].		
	
T:	 Πιο	κουρασμένος.		So,	πιο	[pyo]	is	affecting	another	adjective	–	just	stays	as,	πιο.	
    It	is	further.	It	is	more	far.		
	
S:	 Είναι	πιο	μακριά	[íne	pyo	makriá].		
	
T:	 Είναι	πιο	μακριά.	It	is	further	than	I	thought.	So	what	will	we	use	for	“than”?		
	
S:	 Από	[apó].		
	
T:	 Από	–	“from”.	No?	It	is	further	from	I	thought.	So	let’s	do	the	first	bit.	It	is	further.		
	
S:	 Είναι	πιο	μακριά	[íne	pyo	makriá].		
	
T:	 Είναι	πιο	μακριά	...	than	...	?		
	
S:	 Από	[apó].		
	
T:	 ...	what	I	thought.	So,	“what”,	when	it	is	not	a	question	word,	we	will	just	use	the	
    word	for	“that”	–	ότι	[óti].	Ότι.	So	when	we	use	“what”,	and	it’s	not	a	question,	it’s	
    not	“τι”	[ti].	It’s	“ότι”	[óti].	So,	“	…	than	what	…	“.		
	
S:	 ...	από	ότι	...	[apó	óti].		
	
T:	 Good.	And,	“I	think”,	like	“I	believe”,	is	νομίζω	[nomízo].	So,	“...	than	I	thought	…”.		
	
S:	 Από	ότι	νόμιζα	[apó	óti	nómiza].		
	
T:	 Good.	You	didn’t	change	to	any	closed	version,	which	is	actually	correct,	because	
    “than	I	thought”,	“than	I	believe”	–	it’s	seen	as	an	open,	ongoing	thing.	So:	Είναι	


                                                                                             386
   πιο	μακριά	από	ότι	νόμιζα	[íne	pyo	makriá	apó	óti	nómiza]	–	than	what	I	believed.	
   Είναι	 πιο	 μακριά	 απ’	 ότι	 νόμιζα	 [íne	 pyo	 makriá	 ap’óti	 nómiza].	 And,	 “από	 ότι”	
   [apó	óti],	it’s	just	going	to	come	together;	you’re	going	to	hear,	“απ’	ότι”	[ap’óti].	
   Απ’	ότι.	Βut	it’s,	από	ότι.	Από	ότι	νόμιζα	[apó	óti	nómiza].	It	is	a	little	further	than	I	
   thought.	So,	a	little	more	far,	is	what	we’re	going	to	say.	It	is	a	little	more	far	than	
   I	thought.		
	
S:	 Είναι	λίγο	πιο	μακριά	απ’	ότι	νόμιζα	[íne	lígho	pyo	makriá	ap’óti	nómiza].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Είναι	 λίγο	 πιο	 μακριά	 απ’	 ότι	 νόμιζα.	 Είναι	 λίγο	 πιο	 μακριά	 από	 ότι	
    νόμιζα	[íne	lígho	pyo	makriá	apó	óti	nómiza].		
	
	 So	λίγο,	again,	“a	little	more”,	no?	We	have	it	in	the	neuter:	λίγο	πιο	μακριά	[lígho	
    pyo	makriá].	But	if	“λίγο”	refers	to	an	object,	then	it	will	change	to	match	it.	So,	
    for	example,	if	we	say,	“a	little	sugar”,	then	we	want	to	match	it	with	“sugar”.		The	
    word	for	“sugar”	is,	ζάχαρη	[zákhari].		
	
S:	 Ζάχαρη.		
	
T:	 Which	 ends	 with	 that	 letter	 (η)	 that	 looks	 like	 an	 “n”	 going	 below	 the	 line	 of	
    writing.	Ζάχαρη,	ζάχαρη.	So	what	gender	do	you	think	that	is?		
	
S:	 I	think	neuter.		
	
T:	 Why	neuter?		
	
S:	 Well,	okay,	it	has	a	feminine	ending,	so	maybe	it	is	feminine.		
	
T:	 That’s	what	I	(laughs)	...	Yeah,	it’s	feminine.	So,	“a	little	...	a	little	sugar”?		
	
S:	 Λίγη	ζάχαρη	[líghi	zákhari].		
	
T:	 Λίγη	ζάχαρη	[líyi	zákhari].	Good.	The	[gh]	(γ)	of	“λίγο”	is	also	softened	by	the	[i]	(η)	
    sound,	 no?	 Λίγη	 ζάχαρη	 [líyi	 zákhari].	 Good.	 So	 we’ve	 seen	 that	 we	 have	 two	
    feminine	endings,	two	big	main	feminine	endings,	no	–	[a]	(α)	and	[i]	(η),	no?	The	
    A	(α)	and	the	I	(η),	or	the	“I”	that	looks	like	an	“n”,	no,	that	goes	below	the	line.	A	
    little	coffee?	How	do	you	think	that	might	be?	A	little	coffee.		
	
S:	 Λίγος	καφές	[líghos	kafés].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Καφές	[kafés]	is	masculine,	so,	λίγος	καφές	[líghos	kafés].	I	will	buy	a	
    little	coffee.		
	
S:	 Θα	αγοράσω	λίγος	καφές	[tha	aghoráso	líghos	kafés].	Ah,	wait.	Θα	αγοράσω	λίγο	
    καφέ	[tha	aghoráso	lígho	kafé].		
	




                                                                                             387
T:	 Very	 good.	 Θα	 αγοράσω	 λίγο	 καφέ.	 So	 here,	 λίγο	 is	 not	 the	 neuter,	 no?	 It’s	
    “λίγος”	[líghos],	losing	the	S	(ς),	because	it’s	behaving	like	“him”.	I	will	buy	“him”,	
    rather	than,	“I	will	buy	he”.	Θα	αγοράσω	λίγο	καφέ.		
	
	 If	we,	if	we	say,	“more	little”,	we	get	the	word	for	“less”	–	πιο	λίγο	[pyo	lígho],	or	
    λιγότερο	[lighótero],	or	λιγότερος	[lighóteros],	λιγότερη	[lighóteri].	So	if	you	want	
    to	say	"less	sugar".	
	
S:	 Λιγότερη	ζάχαρη	[lighóteri	zákhari].		
	
T:	 Λιγότερη	ζάχαρη.		
	




                                                                                        388

Teacher:	Again,	what	was	the	word	for,	more?		
	
Student:	Πιο	[pyo].		
	
T:	 	And,	close?		
	
S:	 Κοντά	[kónda].		
	
T:	 Κοντά	[kondá].	More	close,	or	closer?		
	
S:	 Πιο	κοντά	[pyo	kondá].		
	
T:	 Πιο	κοντά.	If	we	want	to	say	“more	sugar”,	we	can’t	use	“πιο”,	because	“πιο”	is	
    used	with	other	describing	words;	so	like	“more	close”	–	πιο	κοντά	[pyo	kondá];	
    “more	good	(or	better)”	–	πιο	καλό,	πιο	καλά	[pyo	kaló,	pyo	kalá].	But	we	won’t	
    use	 “πιο”	 with	 nouns,	 words	 we	 put	 “the”	 or	 “a”	 in	 front	 of.	 So	 we	 won’t	 use	
    “πιο”	to	say	“more	sugar”.	And	we	also	won’t	use	it	with	verbs.	So	we	won’t	use	
    “πιο”	 to	 say,	 for	 example,	 “I	 sleep	 more”,	 “I	 try	 more”.	 So,	 πιο,	 just	 with	 other	
    describing	words;	otherwise,	we	use	something	else.		
	
	 We’ve	seen	briefly,	και	άλλο	[ke	álo],	και	άλλη	[ke	áli]	–	“and	other”;	we	can	use	
    this	for	“more”.	We	could	also	use,	πιο	πολύ	[pyo	polí],	πιο	πολύ	for	“more”.	And	
    we	 also	 have,	 περισσότερο	 [perisótero]	 –	 that’s	 the	 neuter	 of	 course.	 We	 could	
    have,	περισσότερη	[perisóteri],	περισσότερος	[perisóteros],	etc.	Περισσότερος.		
	
S:	 Περισσότερος.		
	
T:	 So	we	have	a	long	word.	The	first	thing	we	should	do	is	not	get	intimidated	by	it,	
    but	 try	 to	 split	 it	 up	 and	 see	 what	 we	 recognise.	 So	 what	 do	 we	 recognise	 in	
    “περισσότερος”?		
	
S:	 There’s	“περι”	[peri].		
	
T:	 Περι.	Good.	Anything	else?	...	“οτερος”?		
	
S:	 I	don’t	know.		
	
T:	 How	do	you	say,	good?	What	is	the	word	for,	good?		
	
S:	 Καλός	[kalós].		
	
T:	 And,	more	good	(better)?	But	there’s	one	word.		
	
S:	 Καλύτερος	[kalíteros].		
	


                                                                                                389
T:	 Ah.	It’s	the	same,	“-υτερος”,	“-οτερος”	[iteros,	oteros].		
	
S:	 Ah.		
	
T:	 Φτηνό	[ftinó]	we	had,	for	example:	“cheap”	–	φτηνότερος	[ftinóteros].	So	actually,	
    you	know,	we	have	the	“-oτερος”	[oteros]	there	as	well,	with	this	kind	of	“more”	
    feeling.	So	even	the	word	for	“more”	–	περισσότερος	[perisóteros],	this	word	for	
    “more”,	 when	 we’re	 not	 referring	 to	 another	 adjective,	 has	 the	 ending	 meaning	
    “more”,	 as	 well;	 that	 “oτερος”,	 “τερος”	 [otero,	 teros]	 ending.	 Περι	 [peri],	 which	
    you	recognised	as	well.	So	looking	at	what	we	recognise	there,	helps	us	digest	a	
    new	word.	Περισσότερος.	So	this	is	“more”,	when	we	aren’t	referring	to	another	
    describing	word.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	more	sugar?		
	
S:	 Περισσότερη	ζάχαρη	[perisóteri	zákhari].		
	
T:	 Περισσότερη	ζάχαρη.	And	we	could	also	have,	πιο	πολύ	ζάχαρη	[pyo	polí	zákhari],	
    instead	of,	περισσότερη.	But	not	“πιο”	by	itself.	No.	Πιο	πολύ	–	“more	a	lot”.	Do	
    you	want	more	sugar?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις	περισσότερη	ζάχαρη;	[thélis	perisóteri	zákhari?].		
	
T:	 Θέλεις	περισσότερη	ζάχαρη;	Θες	[thes],	we	could	also	say	“θες”,	this	contraction	
    of	 θέλεις,	 that’s	 very	 common.	 Θες	 περισσότερη	 ζάχαρη;	 [thes	 perisóteri	
    zákhari?].	 You	 could	 also	 say,	 και	 άλλη	 ζάχαρη	 [ke	 áli	 zákhari]	 –	 “and	 another	
    sugar”,	 just	 used	 like	 “more”.	 Θες	 περισσότερη	 ζάχαρη,	 και	 άλλη	 ζάχαρη,	 πιο	
    πολύ	 ζάχαρη;	 [thes	 perisóteri	 zákhari,	 ke	 áli	 zákhari,	 pyo	 polí	 zákhari?].	 How	
    would	you	say,	Μore	coffee?		
	
S:	 Περισσότερος	καφές	[perisóteros	kafés].		
	
T:	 Περισσότερος	καφές.	You	want	a	little	more	coffee?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις	περισσότερο	καφές	...	καφέ;	[thélis	perisótero	kafés	…	kafé?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλεις	περισσότερο	καφέ;	[thélis	perisótero	kafé?].	And	if	you	wanted	to	
    stress,	a	little	more,	you	could	also	say?		
	
S:	 Θες	λίγο	περισσότερο	καφέ;	[thes	lígho	perisótero	kafé?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θες	λίγο	περισσότερο	καφέ;	And	how	would	you	say,	Do	you	want	a	little	
    more?,	referring	to	the	coffee.	So	imagine	you’re	pouring	somebody	a	coffee	and	
    you	say,	Do	you	want	a	little	more?		
	
S:	 Θες	λίγο	περισσότερο;	[thes	lígho	perisótero?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θες	λίγο	περισσότερο;	And	what	gender	is	“λίγο”	in?		
	


                                                                                            390
S:	 It’s	neuter.		
	
T:	 It’s	 neuter,	 no?	 ’Cos	 it’s	 a	 “little	 more”,	 it’s	 referring	 to,	 περισσότερο,	 another	
    describing	 word.	 So	 we	 go	 into	 the	 neuter	 –	 λίγο	 [lígho].	 And	 what	 gender	 is	
    περισσότερο	 in,	 when	 you	 say,	 Θες	 λίγο	 περισσότερο;	 [thes	 lígho	 perisótero?],	
    and	you	mean	coffee?		
	
S:	 Masculine.		
	
T:	 It’s	the	masculine.	No?	Even	though	they	look	the	same.	Θες	λίγο	περισσότερο;	So	
    for	 “more”,	 we	 have	 “πιο”	 if	 we’re	 referring	 to	 another	 describing	 word	 –	 πιο	
    μακριά	[pyo	makriá],	πιο	κοντά	[pyo	kondá],	πιο	κουρασμένος	[pyo	kurazménos];	
    or	otherwise,	περισσότερο	[perisótero]	for	“more”.	And	we	also	saw	that	we	can	
    use,	 πιο	 πολύ	 [pyo	 polí],	 and	 also,	 και	 άλλο,	 και	 άλλη	 [ke	 álo,	 ke	 áli],	 to	 mean	
    “more”.		
	
	 How	is,	You	try?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθείς	[prospathís].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθείς.	And	what	is	the	closed	version	of,	προσπαθείς?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθήσεις	[prospathísis].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθήσεις.	Good.	With	these	verbs	that	have	their	accent	on	the	end,	we	can	
    get	the	closed	version	by	inserting	this	“-ήσ-”	[-ís-],	no?	Προσπαθώ,	προσπαθήσω	
    [prospathó,	 prospathíso],	 προσπαθείς,	 προσπαθήσεις	 [prospathís,	 prospathísis].	
    So	 that’s,	 “You	 try”.	 You	 have	 to	 try	 more,	 like,	 You	 have	 to	 make	 more	 of	 an	
    effort.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	προσπαθήσεις	περισσότερο	[prépi	na	prospathísis	perisótero].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 προσπαθήσεις	 περισσότερο.	 So	 you	 used	 the	 closed	 version	
    there	 (προσπαθήσεις),	 which	 makes	 sense,	 because	 when	 we	 say,	 περισσότερο,	
    we	 don’t	 mean	 “more	 often”,	 we	 mean,	 “You	 have	 to	 make	 more	 of	 an	 effort”;	
    “You	 have	 to	 try	 more.”	 You	 could	 even	 say,	 Πρέπει	 να	 προσπαθήσεις	 και	 άλλο	
    [prépi	na	prospathísis	ke	álo].	So	this	“και	άλλο”	expression	is	very	flexible	–	this	
    “and	another”,	to	say	“more”.	Πρέπει	να	προσπαθήσεις	και	άλλο.	You	have	to	eat	
    more?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	φας	περισσότερο	[prépi	na	fas	perisótero].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	φας	περισσότερο.	So	if	you	say,	Πρέπει	να	φας	περισσότερο,	it	means,	
    “Now	 –	 you	 have	 to	 eat	 more.”	 But	 maybe	 you	 could	 also	 say,	 Πρέπει	 να	 τρως	
    περισσότερο	 [prépi	 na	 tros	 perisótero],	 and	 it	 would	 be	 understood,	 you	 know,	
    generally,	“Υou	have	to	eat	more.”		
	


                                                                                               391
	 What	was,	I	travel?		
	
S:	 Ταξιδεύω	[taksidhévo].		
	
T:	 Ταξιδεύω.	You	have	to	travel	more.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	ταξιδέψεις	περισσότερο	[prépi	na	taksidhépsis	perisótero].		
	
T:	 You	 could	 have	 “ταξιδέψεις”	 [taksidhépsis],	 like,	 you	 know	 –	 Υou	 have	 to	 travel	
    more	in	order	for	something	–	you	know,	like,	to	achieve	something,	to	learn	what	
    you	need	to,	to	…	to	better	your	business,	or	whatever.	But	otherwise,	if	we	just	
    mean,	 you	 know,	 you	 should	 travel	 more,	 here	 we	 really	 have	 the	 meaning	 of	
    “more	often”	–	this	is	open	and	ongoing.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	ταξιδεύεις	περισσότερο	[prépi	na	taksidhévis	perisótero].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 ταξιδεύεις	 περισσότερο.	 Very	 good.	 And	 also,	 instead	 of	
    “περισσότερο”,	you	could	have,	“πιο	πολύ”	[pyo	polí]	–	“more	very”,	πιο	πολύ,	as	
    well.	So	there’s	quite	a	few	ways	to	express	this	idea	in	Greek.	You	will	hear	many:	
    και	άλλο	[ke	álo],	πιο	πολύ	[pyo	polí],	περισσότερο	[perisótero].		
	
	 What	do	you	like	more?	What	pleases	you	more?		
	
S:	 Τι	σου	αρέσει	περισσότερο;	[ti	su	arési	perisótero?].		
	
T:	 Τι	σου	αρέσει	περισσότερο;	So	“περισσότερο”	we	are	using,	no,	the	neuter	in	all	
    of	these	cases.	But	sometimes	“περισσότερο”	might	refer	to	things	in	the	mind	of	
    the	native.	So	if	somebody	says,	“You	have	to	do	more”	–	when	they	say	“more”,	
    in	their	mind	they	mean	“more	things”.	You	know	this,	because	Greeks	will	say	...	
    What	will	they	say	instead	of	“περισσότερο”,	if	they	mean	things?		
	
S:	 Περισσότερα	[perisótera].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	κάνεις	περισσότερα	[prépi	na	kánis	perisótera].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	κάνεις	περισσότερα.	So	that	can	be	confusing.	You	might	think:	Oh,	is	
    this	one	of	these,	like	“-ly”	things;	is	this	one	of	these	“-ly”	describing	words	that	
    don’t	 change.	 No?	 And	 it’s	 actually	 just	 in	 the	 mind	 of	 the	 Greek	 speaker	 there	
    when	they	say,	“You	have	to	do	more”,	they	mean	“more	things”	–	περισσότερα.	
    And	 that	 refers	 to,	 περισσότερα	 πράγματα	 [perisótera	 prághmata]	 –	 “more	
    things”.	So	don’t	let	that	confuse	you,	if	you	come	across	it.		
	
	 What	was	the	word	for	“very”?		
	
S:	 Πόλυ	[póli].		


                                                                                             392
	
T:	 Πολύ	[polí].	How	would	you	say,	I’m	very	far	away?		
	
S:	 Είμαι	πολύ	μακριά	[íme	polí	makriá].		
	
T:	 Good.	I’m	very	far	away	from	you?		
	
S:	 Είμαι	πολύ	μακριά	σου	[íme	polí	makriá	su].		
	
T:	 Good.	Είμαι	πολύ	μακριά	σου.	So,	πολύ	[polí]	is	“very”	or	“a	lot”,	no?	If	we	say,	
    for	example,	I	like	it	a	lot.		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	πολύ	[mu	arési	polí].		
	
T:	 Μου	αρέσει	πολύ.	But	if	[polí]	refers	to	a	noun,	meaning	“a	lot	of”	or	“many”,	it	
    should	match	that	noun.	So	if	you	say,	A	lot	of	sugar?		
	
S:	 Πολλή	ζάχαρη	[polí	zákhari].		
	
T:	 Πολλή	ζάχαρη.	It’s	already	matching.	No?	But	actually,	the	“πολύ”	[polí]	of	“a	lot”,	
    and	 the	 “πολλή”	 [polí]	 of	 feminine,	 like	 in	 “πολλή	 ζάχαρη”	 [polí	 zákhari],	 they	
    differentiate	 by	 “πολλή”	 having	 two	 L’s	 (λλ),	 and	 also	 ending	 in	 the	 feminine	
    ending	of	“πολλή	ζάχαρη”	–	we	have	the	feminine	ending	there,	the	“n”	that	goes	
    below	the	line	(η)	–	whereas,	πολύ	“very”,	has	one	L	(λ)	and	has	the	[i]	sound	that	
    is	 the	 U	 (υ),	 the	 U,	 when	 it’s	 by	 itself	 sounding	 like	 an	 [i].	 So	 it	 is	 matching,	
    although	 you	 might	 not	 hear	 it.	 And	 what	 if	 we	 say,	 Many	 coffees?	 So,	 “coffee”	
    was,	καφές	[kafés]	and,	coffees?		
	
S:	 Καφέδες	[kafédhes].		
	
T:	 Καφέδες.	Very	good.	So,	Many	coffees?		
	
S:	 Πολλοί	καφέδες	[polí	kafédhes].		
	
T:	 Πολλοί	καφέδες.	And	it’s	actually	still	matching,	because	here	we	write	it	OI	(οι),	
    no:	two	L’s	(λλ)	and	 OI	(οι).	 So	this	 extra	L	(λ)	is	just	to	kind	of	differentiate	it	a	
    little	more	from	“very”	(πολύ	[polí]),	no,	when	we	mean	like	“a	lot	of”	or	“many”,	
    we	…	we	have,	two	L’s	(λλ).		
	
	 Γυναίκα	[yinéka]	is	“woman”	–	γυναίκα.		
	
S:	 Γυναίκα.		
	
T:	 Like	in	“misogynist”,	no	(“woman	hater”):	Μισώ	[misó]	–	“I	hate”.	Gynist	…	gyny	…	
    misogyny.	Γυναίκα	–	“woman”.		
	
S:	 Γυναίκα.		


                                                                                                 393
	
T:	 And	women?		
	
S:	 Γυναίκες	[yinékes].		
	
T:	 Γυναίκες.	Many	women?		
	
S:	 Πολλές	γυναίκες	[polés	yinékes].		
	
T:	 Ah,	 finally,	 we	 can	 hear	 it	 change,	 no?	 Πολλές	 γυναίκες.	 Good.	 Many	 women	 –	
    πολλές	γυναίκες.	How	would	you	say,	Many	friends?	And	we	mean	female	friends.		
	
S:	 Πολλές	φίλες	[polés	fíles].		
	
T:		Πολλές	φίλες.	I	have	many	female	friends.		
	
S:	 Έχω	πολλές	φίλες	[ékho	polés	fíles].		
	
T:	 Έχω	πολλές	φίλες.	I	have	many	friends	–	and	we	mean	masculine	or	mixed.	I	have	
    many	friends.	
	
S:	 Έχω	πολλούς	φίλους	[ékho	polús	fílus].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Έχω	πολλούς	φίλους.	Ah.	“Πολλούς”	is	actually	acting	like	the	word	for	
    “τους”	 [tus],	 and	 “-ος”	 [os]	 nouns,	 when	 “-ος”	 [os]	 nouns	 are	 behaving	 like	
    “them”,	 rather	 than	 “they”,	 they	 also	 take	 “-ους”	 [us].	 So,	 I	 have	 them	 …	 I	 have	
    many	friends	–	Έχω	πολλούς	φίλους	[ékho	polús	fílus].		
	
	 So	although	most	describing	words	behave	in	the	same	way,	or	just	like	nouns	do,	
    with	 some	 describing	 words	 we	 have	 to	 pay	 special	 attention	 and	 avoid	 getting	
    automatic.	We	need	to	pay	attention	to	when,	describing	words	maybe	referring	
    to	 things	 that	 we	 don’t	 think	 they	 are,	 no?	 We	 might	 need	 to	 take	 a	 little	 more	
    time	to	actually	look	…	Oh,	what	is	that	referring	to?	Is	it	referring	to	me,	because	
    I’m	saying	“I’m	a	little	far”,	or	is	“little”	referring	to	“far”,	rather	than	to	“me”.	So	
    with	 a	 couple	 of	 describing	 words,	 we’re	 going	 to	 have	 to	 put	 a	 little	 more	
    thought.	And	we	also	need	to	understand	that	some	describing	words	might	not	
    change	 always	 in	 the	 typical	 way	 we	 expect	 them	 to.	 They	 might	 even	 have	
    different	meanings,	depending	on	whether	they	change	or	not	–	like	we	saw	with:	
    καλός,	 καλή	 [kalós,	 kalí],	 etc.,	 meaning	 “good”,	 and	 then,	 καλά	 [kalá]	 –	 well”,	
    which	 doesn’t	 change;	 κοντός,	 κοντή,	 κοντό	 [kondós,	 kondí,	 kondó],	 etc.,	 for	
    “short”,	and	then	κοντά	[kondá]	–	“close	by”;	πολύ,	πολλή	[polí,	polí],	as	a	word	
    that	doesn’t	change	meaning	“very”,	and	then	when	it	changes,	meaning	“many”,	
    or	“a	lot	of”.	So	with	some	words,	you	won’t	want	to	just	see	one	example	of	it	
    behaving	 in	 a	 way	 and	 say,	 okay,	 this	 word	 behaves	 like	 that,	 no?	 Sometimes	 it	
    might	behave	one	way	when	it’s	doing	something,	and	in	a	different	way	when	it’s	
    doing	something	else.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	like,	or,	It	is	pleasing	to	me?		
	
Student:	Μου	αρέσει	[mu	arési].		
	
T:	 Μου	αρέσει.	And,	I	liked	it,	or,	It	was	pleasing	to	me?		
	
S:	 Μου	άρεσε	[mu	árese].		
	
T:	 Μου	άρεσε.	Ι	would	like	it;	I	would	like.		
	
S:	 Θα	μου	άρεσε	[tha	mu	árese].		
	
T:	 Θα	 μου	 άρεσε.	 Very	 good.	 So	 we	 combine	 “θα”	 with	 our	 open	 past	 to	 get	
    “would”,	 but	 of	 course,	 αρέσω	 [aréso]	 doesn’t	 have	 any	 alternative	 version,	 so	
    άρεσε	[árese]	works	for	that.	Θα	μου	άρεσε	–	Ι	would	like;	I	would	like	it.		
	
	 I	would	like	us	to	speak	Greek.	I	would	like,	να	[na],	we	speak	Greek.		
	
S:	 Θα	μου	άρεσε	να	μιλήσουμε	Ελληνικά	[tha	mu	árese	na	milísume	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	μου	άρεσε	να	μιλήσουμε	Ελληνικά.	So	with	“μιλήσουμε”	[milísume],	it	
    would	mean	now,	or	some	specific	point	–	like	when	we	meet	up	on	Tuesday,	or	
    whatever.	But	if	you	meant	generally,	what	might	you	say?	I	would	like	us	to	speak	
    Greek.		
	
S:	 Θα	μου	άρεσε	να	μιλάμε	Ελληνικά	[tha	mu	árese	na	miláme	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θα	μου	άρεσε	να	μιλάμε	(or,	να	μιλούμε	[na	milúme])	Ελληνικά.		
	
	 We’ve	seen	that	we	have	μιλάς	[milás],	no,	for	you;	μιλάτε	[miláte]	for,	you	plural;	
    and	 then	 some	 alternative	 versions	 like	 μιλάμε	 [miláme]	 instead	 of	 μιλούμε	
    [milúme];	 μιλάν,	 μιλάνε	 [milán,	 miláne]	 instead	 of,	 μιλούν	 or	 μιλούνε	 [milún,	
    milúne]	–	but	they	mean	the	same.	Although	with	“-άμε”	[-ame]	and	“-άνε”	[-ane]	
    it’s	much	more	common.	Θα	μου	άρεσε	να	μιλάμε	(να	μιλούμε)	Ελληνικά.		
	
	 You	will	often	hear	Greeks	saying	“them”	in	English,	when	they’re	talking	about	a	
    language;	like,	“I	don’t	speak	them	very	well.”	This	is	of	course,	’cos	in	Greek,	we	
    have	 “Ελληνικά”,	 which	 is	 neuter	 plural.	 So	 this	 might	 transfer	 over	 into	 Greek	
    speakers’	English.	So	we	can	learn	from	that,	no?	We’ve	said	we	can	learn	from	
    those	mistakes	that	other	Greek	speakers	might	make	in	English,	and	also	make	
    sure	that	we	say	it	right	in	Greek.	So	if	you	say,	I	don’t	speak	it	well,	and	you’re	
    referring	to	a	specific	language,	how	will	you	say	that?	
	
	S:	Δεν	τα	μιλάω	καλά	[dhen	ta	miláo	kalá].

T:	 Good.	If	you	really	want	to	refer	to	that	specific	language,	Δεν	τα	μιλάω	καλά.	If	
    you	know	what	you’re	talking	about,	maybe	you’d	just	say,	Δεν	μιλάω	καλά	[dhen	
    miláo	 kalá].	 No?	 But	 “τα”,	 neuter	 plural,	 because	 we	 have,	 τα	 Ελληνικά	 [ta	
    eliniká].	Do	you	speak	it	well?		
	
S:	 Τα	μιλάς	καλά;	[ta	milás	kalá?].		
	
T:	 Τα	μιλάς	καλά;	Νο?	So	we	have	an	AS	(-άς)	[ás]	ending	here,	with	μιλάς,	instead	of	
    our	common	IS	(-εις)	[is],	like	in	θέλεις	[thélis],	for	example,	because	μιλάς	[milás]	
    is	μιλάω	[miláo]	–	AO	(άω)	[áo]	–	μιλάω.	Do	you	guys	speak	them	well?	So,	Do	you	
    guys	speak	it	well?		
	
	S:	Τα	μιλάτε	καλά;	[ta	miláte	kalá?].		
	
T:	 Τα	μιλάτε	καλά;	And	again,	“-άτε”	[áte]	ending,	no?	We	don’t	speak	well.		
	
S:	 Δεν	τα	μιλάμε	καλά	[dhen	ta	miláme	kalá].		
	
T:	 Δεν	τα	μιλάμε	καλά.	Δεν	μιλάμε	καλά	[dhen	miláme	kalá].	So	we	have	“τα”,	when	
    referring	to	a	specific	language,	no?	We	don’t	think	about	the	word	“language”	or	
    anything	like	this.	We	think	about	the	language	that	we	are	talking	about,	no?	Τα	
    Ελληνικά	[ta	eliniká].	And	I	mentioned	you	might	hear	Greek	speakers	do	this	in	
    English	as	well,	no?	Like,	“Oh,	I	don’t	speak	them”,	“I	have	to	practice	them”,	for	
    example.		
	
	 The	 same	 with	 “hair”,	 for	 example	 is,	 τα	 μαλλιά	 [ta	 maliá].	 And	 you	 will	 always	
    hear	 Greeks	 in	 English	 saying,	 “I	 have	 to	 cut	 them”,	 no?	 Or	 in	 many	 languages,	
    actually.	Speakers	of	many	languages	do	this	in	English,	because	“hair”	tends	to	be	
    plural.	But	in	English	it’s	“it”,	no?	So	we	can	listen	to	this	and,	most	mistakes	that	
    we	hear	popping	up	often,	try	to	learn	something	from	them.		
	
	 Αγγλικά	[angliká],	Aγγλικά,	is	“English”;	Αγγλικά	[angliká]	or	Αγγλικά	[agliká].	You	
    can	hear	both	pronunciations:	Αγγλικά,	Αγγλικά	[angliká,	agliká].		
	
S:	 Αγγλικά.		
	
T:	 Spelt	A	(α)	-	γάμα,	γάμα	(γγ)	[gháma,	gháma],	-λικά	[liká]	-	L	(λ)	-	l	(ι)	-	Κ	(κ)	-	A	(ά),	
    no?	So,	γάμα,	γάμα	(γγ),	two	γ’s	together,	give	us	the	sound	of	[n-g],	like	NG,	or	
    just	[g].	But	this	isn’t	like	a	γάμα	(γ)	[gháma]	anymore,	but	like	a	“hard	G”,	like	in	
    English	 “go”,	 no?	 Αγγλικά,	 Αγγλικά	 [agliká,	 angliká].	 Another	 word	 like	 this	 with	
    these	two	gammas,	giving	us	this	sound	is,	άγγελος	[ángelos],	or	άγγελος	[ágelos].	
    What	 do	 you	 think	 that	 means	 –	 άγγελος,	 άγγελος	 [ángelos,	 ágelos]?	 We’ll	 find	
    the	English	if	we	think	of	NG	there.		
	
S:	 The	angel?		
	



                                                                                            396
T:	 Angel	 –	 like	 the	 name,	 Angelo,	 no?	 And	 again	 that’s	 with	 two	 γ’s;	 you	 don’t	 get	
    any	Ν	there;	you	don’t	have	any	“n”	written	there.	A	(ά)	-	γάμα,	γάμα	(γγ)	[gháma,	
    gháma]	 -	 Ε	 (ε)	 -	 Λ	 (λ)	 -	 Ο	 (o)	 -	 S	 (ς).	 And	 this	 gives	 us	 NG,	 or	 just	 G.	 Άγγελος,	
    άγγελος	 [ángelos,	 ágelos].	 Γαλλικά	 [ghaliká],	 Γαλλικά	 is	 “French“;	 Ισπανικά	
    [ispaniká]	–	you	can	guess.		
	
S:	 Spanish.		
	
T:	 Spanish.	“Cyprus”	was	Κύπρος	[kípros],	no?	Or,	Η	Κύπρος	[i	kípros].	It	was	another	
    of	those	[os]	(-ος)	nouns,	which	are	actually	feminine;	Η	Κύπρος	–	“the	Cyprus”.	
    And	in	Cyprus	we	have,	τα	Kυπριακά	[ta	kipriaká],	the	Cypriot	dialect	or	language.	
    Τα	Κυπριακά.		
	
S:	 Τα	Κυπριακά.		
	
T:	 Do	you	speak	Cypriot?		
	
S:	 Μιλάς	τα	Κυπριακά;	[milás	ta	kipriaká?].		
	
T:	 Good.	In	this	situation	I	would	leave	out	the	“τα”	[ta].		
	
S:	 Μιλάς	Κυπριακά;	[milás	kipriaká?].		
	
T:	 Μιλάς	 Κυπριακά;	 “Τα”	 is	 more,	 like,	 if	 you	 will	 begin	 with	 something	 like,	 you	
    know,	 “Cypriot	 is	 easy”.	 Then	 you	 would	 want	 to	 say,	 “The	 Cypriot	 is	 easy”.	 But	
    with	the	verb,	just,	Mιλάς	Κυπριακά.	No,	but	I	speak	Greek.		
	
S:	 Όχι,	αλλά	...	όχι	αλλά	μιλάω	Ελληνικά	[óchi	alá	miláo	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Όχι	 αλλά	 (μα,	 αλλά,	 or	 μα	 [ma],	 we	 could	 have)	 μιλάω	 Ελληνικά.	
    Basically	I	don’t	understand	it	very	well	...	and	we	mean	a	language.		
	
S:	 Βασικά	δεν	τα	καταλαβαίνω	πολύ	καλά	[vasiká	dhen	ta	katalavéno	polí	kalá].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Βασικά	 δεν	 τα	 καταλαβαίνω	 πολύ	 καλά	 –	 for	 “very	 well”,	 or	 just	 “καλά”.	
    How	would	you	say,	I	speak	a	little?		
	
S:	 Μιλάω	λίγο	[miláo	lígho].		
	
T:	 Μιλάω	λίγο.	Good.	I	speak	a	little	Greek.		
	
S:	 Μιλάω	λίγο	Ελληνικά	[miláo	lígho	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Μιλάω	λίγο	Ελληνικά.	So	this,	this	is	correct,	and	it	sounds	maybe	a	little	bit	more	
    like,	“I	speak	Greek	a	little”,	but	you	can	also	make	“little”	refer	to	“Greek”.	Make	
    it	sound	more	like,	I	speak	a	little	Greek.	How	would	that	be?		
	


                                                                                                     397
S:	 Μιλάω	λίγα	Ελληνικά	[miláo	lígha	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μιλάω	λίγα	Ελληνικά.	What	was	the	word	for,	short?		
	
S:	 Κοντός	[kondós].		
	
T:	 Κοντός	[kondós],	or	κοντός	[kodós].	So	now	we’ve	seen	two	examples,	no,	of	an	N,	
    that	we	will	hear	or	not	hear.	We	could	have,	κοντός	[kodós],	or	κοντός	[kondós];	
    as	 we	 could	 have	 Αγγλικά	 [agliká],	 no,	 for	 “English”,	 or	 Αγγλικά	 [angliká].	 So	 we	
    have,	 κοντός,	 κοντός	 [kodós,	 kondós],	 for	 “short”,	 and	 “close”?	 How	 do	 we	 say,	
    close?	Something	like,	“short	-ly”.		
	
S:	 Κοντά	[kondá].		
	
T:	 Κοντά.	Από	κοντά	[apó	kondá]	–	“from	close”,	can	be	used	like	“face-to-face”,	or	
    something	 like	 this,	 no?	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 for	 example,	 “Let’s	 speak	 face-to-
    face”.	What	is	the	sound	we	can	use	for,	“Let’s”,	for	Let’s?		
	
S:	 Ας	[as].		
	
T:	 Ας.	Good.	Like	in,	“Aς	πούμε”	[as	púme]	–	“let’s	say”	–	you	hear	that	a	lot.	Let’s	
    speak	face-to-face	–	“from	close”.		
	
S:	 Ας	μιλήσουμε	από	κοντά	[as	milísume	apó	kondá].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ας	μιλήσουμε	από	κοντά.		
	
	 We	 saw	 how	 those	 verbs	 with	 their	 accent	 on	 the	 end	 can	 have	 “άτε”	 [áte]	 or	
    “είτε”	[íte]	for	the	formal	“you”,	or	the	plural	“you”,	no,	rather	than	our	standard	
    “ετε”	[ete].	So	usually	we	add	“ετε”	for	our	plural,	or	our	formal	“you”.	So,	θέλω	
    [thélo]	is	“I	want”	and,	You	guys	want?		
	
S:	 Θέλετε	[thélete].		
	
T:	 Θέλετε.	I	like	it?		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	[mu	arési].		
	
T:	 Μου	αρέσει.	I	like	you	guys;	You	guys	please	me.		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσετε	[mu	arésete].		
	
T:	 Μου	 αρέσετε.	 So	 usually	 we	 have	 “ετε”	 [ete],	 no,	 for	 this	 formal	 or	 this	 plural	
    “you”.	 But	 with	 our	 verbs	 that	 have	 their	 accent	 on	 the	 ending,	 we	 have	 “άτε”	
    [áte]	or	“είτε”	[íte].	What	is,	I	can?		
	
S:	 Μπορώ	[boró].		


                                                                                              398
	
T:	 Μπορώ.	You	can,	for	plural?		
	
S:	 Μπορείτε	[boríte].		
	
T:	 Μπορείτε.	Good.	I	try,	was?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθώ	[prospathó].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθώ.	And,	You	try,	plural	or	formal?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθείτε	[prospathíte].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθείτε.	Good.	So	those	verbs	that	have	“είτε”	[íte]	for	the	“you”	plural	or	
    formal,	just	have	the	endings	we	would	expect	them	to	have	for	the	other	forms,	
    no?	Μπορεί,	μπορείς,	μπορούν,	μπορούνε	[borí,	borís,	borún,	borúne],	etc.		
	
	 Χρήσιμος	[khrísimos],	χρήσιμος,	is	“useful”.	Χρήσιμος.		
	
S:	 	Χρήσιμος.		
	
T:	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 This	 one	 is	 more	 useful,	 and	 we	 mean	 a	 neuter	 thing?	 This	
    one	is	more	useful.		
	
S:	 Αυτό	είναι	πιο	χρήσιμο	[aftó	íne	pyo	khrísimo].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Αυτό	 είναι	 πιο	 χρήσιμο.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 This	 one	 is	 the	 most	
    useful,	or,	the	more	useful?		
	
S:	 Αυτό	είναι	το	πιο	χρήσιμο	[aftó	íne	to	pyo	khrísimo].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτό	είναι	το	πιο	χρήσιμο.	Or,	το	χρησιμότερο	[to	khrisimótero].	Αυτό	είναι	
    το	 χρησιμότερο	 [aftó	 íne	 to	 khrisimótero].	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 We	 want	
    something	a	little	more	useful?	We	want	something	a	little	more	useful.		
	
S:	 Θέλουμε	κάτι	λίγο	πιο	χρήσιμο	[thélume	káti	lígho	pyo	khrísimo].		
	
T:	 Good.	We	have,	χρήσιμο	[khrísimo],	the	neuter,	no,	because	we	say,	κάτι	[káti]	–
    Something	 more	 useful.	 And	 κάτι	 –	 “something”,	 must	 be	 neuter,	 no?	 Θέλουμε	
    κάτι	λίγο	πιο	χρήσιμο	[thélume	káti	lígho	pyo	khrísimo].		
	
	 “I	use”,	I	use,	so	the	verb	is,	χρησιμοποιώ	[khrisimopió].	Χρησιμοποιώ.		
	
S:	 Χρησιμοποιώ.		
	
T:	 So	 it’s	 like	 “χρήσιμο”	 [khrísimo],	 with	 “ποιώ”	 [pió]	 on	 the	 end	 –	 χρησιμοποιώ.	
    And,	of	course,	we	have	the	accent	on	the	end,	no?	Which	means	for	the	“you”	


                                                                                           399
   plural,	we	won’t	use	“ετε”	[ete],	no,	but	“είτε”	[íte]	or	“άτε”	[áte].	Which	one	do	
   you	think	it	is?	You	guys	use.		
	
S:	 “-είτε”	[íte]?	Xρησιμοπείτε	[khrisimopíte].		
	
T:	 But	 we	 have	 two	 Ι’s,	 [i],	 ah,	 because	 we	 have	 “-ποιώ”	 [pió],	 χρησιμοποιώ	
    [khrisimopió],	 and	 when	 we	 take	 off	 the	 Ο	 (ώ),	 and	 we	 put	 “είτε”	 [íte],	 we	 are	
    actually	left	with	two	Ι’s.	Χρησιμοποιείτε	[khrisimopi-íte].		
	
S:	 Χρησιμοποιείτε	[khrisimopiíte].		
	
T:		Good.	Don’t	you	guys	use	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	χρησιμοποιείτε;	[dhen	to	khrisimopiíte?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	χρησιμοποιείτε;	Don’t	you	guys	want	to	use	it?	Don’t	you	guys	want	to	use	
    it?	You	don’t	want	to	use	it	–	in	the	plural.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλετε	να	το	χρησιμοποιείτε;	[dhen	thélete	na	to	khrisimopiíte?].		
	
T:	 Okay.	So	let’s	imagine	we	are	talking	about,	you	know,	one	very	specific	situation,	
    rather	than	generally.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλετε	να	το	χρησιμοποιήσετε;	[dhen	thélete	na	to	khrisimopiísete?].		
	
T:		Good.	And	when	you	put	the	“-ήσ-”	[-ís-],	you	also	doubled	the	“I”,	no,	and	you	
    went	back	to	“ετε”	[ete],	which	is	correct.	We	only	have	“είτε”	[íte]	or	“άτε”	[áte]	
    in	the	standard	forms,	no.	Otherwise,	we	go	back	to	“ετε”	[ete].	Δεν	θέλετε	να	το	
    χρησιμοποιήσετε;	Very	good.

Teacher:	How	do	you	say,	I	want,	in	Greek?		
	
Student:	Θέλω	[thélo].		
	
T:	 Θέλω.	And,	Υou	want?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις	[thélis].		
	
T:	 Θέλεις.	And,	You	want,	for	the	formal,	or	the	plural,	if	you’re	talking	to	more	than	
    one	person.	You	guys	want.		
	
S:	 Θέλετε	[thélete].		
	
T:	 Θέλετε.	 Good.	 So	 usually	 we	 have	 “ετε”	 [ete]	 for	 the	 “you”	 plural.	 What	 is,	 I	
    speak?		
	
S:	 Μιλάω	[miláo].		
	
T:	 Μιλάω,	or	μιλώ	[miló].	And	the	closed	version	–	Μιλάω	has	its	accent	on	the	end,	
    so?		
	
S:	 Μιλήσω	[milíso].		
	
T:	 Μιλήσω.	Περπατάω	[perpatáo],	περπατάω,	was	“I	walk”.	Περπατάω.	So	we	could	
    have,	περπατάω,	or	you	might	also	hear,	περπατώ	[perpató].		
	
S:	 Περπατώ.		
	
T:	 So	 if	 you	 hear	 “περπατώ”	 [perpató],	 you	 won’t	 know	 whether	 this	 verb	 uses	
    “είτε”	[íte]	or	“άτε”	[áte]	for	the	plural	or	formal	“you”,	or	“άς”	[ás]	or	“είς”	[ís]	for	
    the	normal	“you”.	When	we	see	“περπατάω”	[perpatáo],	we	know	that	it	will	use	
    “άτε”	[áte]	for	“you”	plural	or	formal,	and	“άς”	[ás]	for	you,	’cos	we	have	the	[a]	
    (ά)	there	in,	περπατάω.	But	as	“περπατώ”	also	exists,	you	might	not	notice	until	
    you	see	some	other	form	of	the	verb.	So,	this	is	one	of	these	verbs	that	have	[a]	
    (ά)	popping	up	in	the	present:	περπατάω,	περπατάτε	[perpatáo,	perpatáτε].	You	
    (informal)	walk?		
	
S:	 Περπατάς	[perpatás].		
	
T:	 Περπατάς.	Συμφωνώ	[simfonó]	was	“I	agree”.	Συμφωνώ.		
	
	S:	Συμφωνώ.		
	




                                                                                           401
T:	 So	this	is	like	“with	voice”,	“together	voice”,	“voices	together”;	like	in	“telephone”	
    (τηλέφωνο	[tiléfono])	–	the	far	voice;	and,	συμφωνώ	–	together	voice,	with	voice.	
    So	that’s	“I	agree”.	“You	agree”,	informal,	is	συμφωνείς	[simfonís].	Συμφωνφείς.		
	
S:	 Συμφωνφείς.		
	
T:	 So,	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 this	 one	 ends	 “συμφωνφείς”,	 you	 can	 work	 out	 the,	 “Υou	
    (formal)	agree”.	You	guys,	you	(plural),	you	guys	agree,	would	be?		
	
S:	 Συμφωνείτε	[simfoníte].		
	
T:	 Συμφωνείτε.	Good.	So	here	we	have	“είτε”	[íte]	for	“you”	formal,	instead	of	“ετε”	
    [ete],	 but	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 versions	 are	 as	 we	 would	 expect	 them	 to	 be,	 no?	 Just	
    with	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 end;	 συμφωνείς	 [simfonís]	 –	 You	 (informal)	 agree.	 He	
    agrees?		
	
S:	 Συμφωνεί	[simfoní].		
	
T:	 Good.	Συμφωνεί.	We	agree.		
	
S:	 Συμφωνούμε	[simfonúme].		
	
T:	 Συμφωνούμε.	They	agree.		
	
S:	 Συμφωνούν	[simfonún].	
	
T:	 Συμφωνούν,	or	συμφωνούνε	[simfonúne].	But,	You	guys	agree?		
	
S:	 Συμφωνείτε	[simfoníte].		
	
T:	 Συμφωνείτε.	 So	 just	 one	 alternative	 form	 with	 these	 that	 have	 “είτε”	 [íte],	 no?	
    That’s	our	only	alternative	form,	in	the	present	–	“είτε”.	And	when	we	go	to	the	
    closed	version	of	the	verb,	we	go	back	to	“ετε”	[ete],	no,	with	all	of	these	verbs.	
    So	 if	 you	 say,	 for	 example,	 Can’t	 you	 guys	 agree?	 How	 would	 that	 be?	 So,	 You	
    guys	can’t.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορείτε	να	συμφωνήσετε;	[dhen	boríte	na	simfonísete?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπορείτε	να	συμφωνήσετε;	So	in	“μπορώ”	[boró]	we	have	“είτε”	
    [íte],	 then	 “μπορείτε”	 [boríte].	 And	 then,	 with	 “συμφωνώ”	 [simfonó],	 because	
    we’re	 using	 the	 closed	 version,	 we	 go	 back	 to	 “ετε”	 [ete].	 Δεν	 μπορείτε	 να	
    συμφωνήσετε;	[dhen	boríte	na	simfonísete?].	Can’t	you	guys	agree	on	something?	
    And	 for,	 “on	 something”,	 we	 can	 just	 say,	 “to	 something”.	 So,	 Can’t	 you	 guys	
    agree	on	something?		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορείτε	να	συμφωνει	...	συμφωνήσετε	σε	κάτι;	[dhen	boríte	na	simfonísete	
    se	káti?].		


                                                                                               402
	
T:	 Σε	κάτι	[se	káti].	Δεν	μπορείτε	να	συμφωνήσετε	σε	κάτι;	Very	good.	So,	“σε”	[se]	
    means	“to”,	but	I	guess	in	some	situations	it	can	mean	“on”	as	well.	But	this	is	the	
    thing	about	prepositions.	So	prepositions	are	these	odd	little	words	like,	σε	[se],	
    “to”;	για	[ya],	“for”;	με	[me],	“with”;	από	[apó],	“from”	–	that	show	some	position	
    or	 movement.	 And	 these	 little	 words	 often	 don’t	 translate	 over	 well	 from	 one	
    language	to	another.	In	one	language,	you	know,	you’ll	say,	“Can’t	you	guys	agree	
    on	something”;	in	the	other,	“Can’t	you	guys	agree	to	something”,	and	in	another,	
    “Can’t	you	guys	agree	for	something”.	No?	So	we	want	to	pay	special	attention	to	
    these.	 And	 just	 bear	 in	 mind	 that	 the	 one	 we’re	 using	 in	 English	 might	 not	
    necessarily	be	the	one	we	use	in	Greek.		
	
	 Don’t	you	guys	want	to	walk?	Don’t	you	guys	want	to	walk?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλετε	να	περπατήσετε;	[dhen	thélete	na	perpatísete?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλετε	να	περπατήσετε;	Are	you	walking	(informal)?		
	
S:	 Περπατάς;	[perpatás?].		
	
T:	 Περπατάς;	Don’t	you	want	to	walk?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλεις	να	περπατήσεις;	[dhen	thélis	na	perpatísis?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλεις	να	περπατήσεις;	Doesn’t	he	want	to	walk?	Doesn’t	she	want	to	walk?	
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλει	να	περπατήσει;	[dhen	théli	na	perpatísi?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 θέλει	 να	 περπατήσει;	 So	 we	 have	 to	 pay	 a	 little	 extra	 special	
    attention,	no,	to	these	verbs	with	their	accent	on	the	end.	We’ve	seen	that	they	
    may	have	A’s	(ά)	popping	up	in	the	“you”	forms,	like	“-άς,	-άτε”	[ás,	áte],	and	also	
    alternative	 versions	 like	 “-άμε,	 -άνε”	 [áme,	 áne];	 or	 they	 might	 just	 have	 “είτε”	
    [íte]	 for	 “you”	 formal,	 instead	 of	 “ετε”	 [ete].	 But	 when	 they’re	 in	 their	 closed	
    form,	 then	 we	 just	 use	 our	 normal	 standard	 endings.	 So,	 for	 example,	 “He’s	
    walking”–	Περπατάει,	περπατά	[perpatái,	perpatá].	“He	doesn’t	want	to	walk”	–	
    Δεν	θέλει	να	περπατήσει	[dhen	théli	na	perpatísi].		
	
	 These	verbs,	with	their	accent	on	the	end,	also	make	their	open	past	in	a	different	
    way.	Give	me	again,	I	walk	(I’m	walking).		
	
S:	 Περπατάω	[perpatáo].		
	
T:	 Περπατάω.	And	the	closed	version	of,	περπατάω?		
	
S:	 Περπατήσω	[perpatíso].		
	
T:	 Περπατήσω.	And,	I	walked?		


                                                                                             403
	
S:	 Περπάτησα	[perpátisa].		
	
T:	 Περπάτησα.	If	you	want	to	say	“I	was	walking”	we	have,	περπατούσα	[perpatúsa].	
    Περπατούσα.		
	
S:	 Περπατούσα.		
	
T:	 So	we	don’t	do	what	we	usually	do	for	this	open	past;	we	don’t	go	from	the	closed	
    version	“περπατάω”	(we	just	used	that),	we	have	this	“-ούσ-”	[ús]	coming	up	for	
    these	 verbs	 with	 their	 accent	 on	 the	 end.	 So,	 “I	 was	 walking”,	 περπατούσα	
    [perpatúsa].		
	
	 So	 we	 have	 the	 same	 sound	 for	 the	 past	 like	 always,	 no:	 the	 “-α”	 [a],	 “-αμε”	
    [ame],	“-αν”	[an],	etc.,	“-ε”	[e],	“-ες”	[es].	But	we	also	have	this	“-ούσ-”	[ús];	and	
    we	accent	this	[ús];	it’s	always	accented.	So,	περπάτησα	[perpátisa]	–	we	have	the	
    accent	third	from	the	end	–	“I	walked”;	and	then,	περπατούσα	[perpatúsa]	–	we	
    have	the	accent	on	the	“-ούσ-”	[ús]	–	“I	was	walking”.	He	was	walking?		
	
S:	 Περπατούσε	[perpatúse].		
	
T:	 Περπατούσε.	You	were	walking	(informal)?		
	
S:	 Περπατούσες	[perpatúses].		
	
T:	 Περπατούσες.	I	was	walking?		
	
S:	 Περπατούσα	[perpatúsa].		
	
T:	 We	were	walking?		
	
S:	 Περπατούσαμε	[perpatúsame].		
	
T:	 Περπατούσαμε.	They	were	walking?		
	
S:	 Περπατούσανε	[perpatúsane].		
	
T:	 Περπατούσανε.	Were	you	guys	walking?		
	
S:	 Περπατούσατε;	[perpatúsate?].		
	
T:	 Περπατούσατε;	What	is,	“I	love”,	like	you	might	hear	often	in	Greek,	“my	love”	–	
    “aγάπη	μου	[aghápi	mu].	And,	I	love?		
	
S:	 Αγαπάω	[aghapáo].		
	



                                                                                         404
T:	 Αγαπάω,	or	αγαπώ	[aghapó].	So	you	said,	αγαπάω	[aghapáo],	which	means	that	
    we’ve	heard	this	“-άω”	[áo]	version,	no?	We	know	it	exists,	which	means	we	know	
    that	we	have,	“Εσύ	[esí]	...	”?		
	
S:	 Αγαπάς	[aghapás].		
	
T:	 Αγαπάς.	And,	“Εσείς	[esís]	...	”?		
	
S:	 Αγαπάτε	[aghapáte].		
	
T:	 Αγαπάτε.	So,	I	loved.	I	loved,	would	be?		
	
S:	 Αγάπησα	[aghápisa].		
	
T:	 Αγάπησα.	I	was	loving,	or,	I	used	to	love?		
	
S:	 Αγαπούσα	[aghapúsa].		
	
T:	 Αγαπούσα.		I	used	to	love	her.		
	
S:	 Την	αγαπούσα	[tin	aghapúsa].		
	
T:	 Την	Αγαπούσα.	You	used	to	love	her.	
	
S:	 Την	αγαπούσες	[tin	aghapúses].		
	
T:		Την	αγαπούσες.		
	
	 We	 said	 that	 we	 could	 use,	 ούτε	 που	 [úte	 pu],	 ούτε	 που,	 like,	 “You	 didn’t	 even	
    (not	 even)”.	 No?	 So,	 if	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 You	 didn’t	 even	 love	 her.	 “Not	 even”	 –	
    ούτε	που	–	“you	loved	her”.	So	how	would	that	be?	You	didn’t	even	love	her.		
	
S:	 Ούτε	που	την	αγαπούσες	[úte	pu	tin	aghapúses].		
	
T:	 Αh,	 okay,	 well	 both	 work:	 αγαπούσες,	 αγάπησες	 [aghapúses,	 aghápises].	 Here	it	
    would	 just	 depend	 on	 what	 you	 had	 in	 the	 mind,	 no?	 You	 know	 …	 You	 weren’t	
    even	in	love	with	her	–	something	more	open;	or,	you	know,	You	didn’t	even	love	
    her.	And	other	than	“ούτε	που”,	you	can	also	hear	“ούτε	καν”	[úte	kan].	Oύτε	καν	
    την	αγάπησες	(την	αγαπούσες)	[úte	kan	tin	aghápises	(tin	aghapúses)].		
	
	                                  	




                                                                                               405

Teacher:	What	was	“I	speak”?		
	
Student:	Μιλάω	[miláo].		
	
T:	 Μιλάω.	And,	I	spoke?		
	
S:	 Μίλησα	[mílisa].		
	
T:	 Μίλησα.	And,	I	was	speaking.	
	
S:	 Μιλούσα	[milúsa].		
	
T:	 Μιλούσα.	So	we	have	the	“-ούσ-”	[ús]	accented,	no,	for	“I	was	speaking”,	which	
    means	 that	 sometimes	 the	 accent	 falls	 in	 different	 places,	 comparing	 these	 two	
    pasts,	no?	We	had,	μίλησα	[mílisa],	and	then	μιλούσα	[milúsa].	But	sometimes	it	
    may	fall	in	the	same	place,	no?	How	would,	We	spoke,	be?		
	
S:	 Μιλήσαμε	[milísame].		
	
T:	 Μιλήσαμε.		And,	We	were	speaking?		
	
S:	 Μιλούσαμε	[milúsame].		
	
T:	 Μιλούσαμε.	 So	 here	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 in	 the	 same	 place:	 μιλήσαμε,	 and	
    μιλούσαμε.	But	we	don’t	have	to	worry	about	that;	we	just	know	that	“-ούσ-”	[ús]	
    is	always	accented.	They	spoke?		
	
S:	 Μίλησαν	[mílisan].		
	
T:	 Μίλησαν.	And,	They	were	speaking?		
	
S:	 Μιλούσανε	[milúsane].		
	
T:	 Μιλούσαν,	μιλούσανε	[milúsan,	milúsane].	I	was	speaking?		
	
	S:	Μιλούσα	[milúsa].		
	
T:	 Μιλούσα.	I	would	speak,	or,	I	was	going	to	speak?		
	
S:	 Θα	μίλησα	[tha	mílisa].		
	
T:	 Θα	μίλησα?	So	it’s	not	just	“θα”	with	the	past;	it’s	“θα”	with	a	certain	type	of	past,	
    which	gives	us	this	meaning	of	“would”,	or,	“was	going	to”.		
	
S:	 Θα	μιλούσα	[tha	milúsa].		


                                                                                         406
	
T:	 Θα	μιλούσα.	Νο?	So	we	have	the	open	past	with	“θα”,	and	we	get	“I	would”,	or,	“I	
    was	going	to”.		
	
	 The	…	the	word	for	“simple”	is	απλός	[aplós].	Απλός	–	like,	A	(α)	-	P	(π)	-	L	(λ)	-	O	
    (ο)	-	S	(ς).	Απλός.		
	
S:	 Απλός.		
	
T:	 And	this	is	the	masculine	form	I	gave	you,	of	course.	How	would	you	say,	simply?		
	
S:	 Απλά	[aplá].		
	
T:	 Απλά.	And	this	is	used	a	lot	in	Greek,	also	like,	“just”,	you	know.	So,	I	don’t	know,	
    if	you	wanted	to	say,	I	wasn’t	going	to	speak	but	I	just	had	to	say	something.	You	
    know,	 you	 could	 say,	 “but	 simply	 I	 had	 to	 say	 something”.	 So,	 I	 wasn’t	 going	 to	
    speak?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	μιλούσα	...	[dhen	tha	milúsa].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θα	μιλούσα	...	but	I	just	had	to	say	something.	In	fact,	you	can	leave	out	the	
    “but”.	You	could	just	say,	Simply	I	had	to	say	something.		
	
S:	 Απλά	είχα	να	πω	κάτι	[aplá	íkha	na	po	káti].		
	
T:	 What	is,	“I	had	to”;	“It	was	necessary”?		
	
S:	 Έπρεπε	να	...	έπρεπε	να	πω	κάτι	[éprepe	na	po	káti].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θα	μιλούσα	αλλά	[dhen	tha	milúsa	alá]	(or	we	could	leave	out	the	
    “αλλά”)	απλά	έπρεπε	να	πω	κάτι	[aplá	éprepe	na	po	káti].	Δεν	θα	μιλούσα	απλά	
    έπρεπε	να	πω	κάτι	[dhen	tha	milúsa	aplá	éprepe	na	po	káti].		
	
	 Χρησιμοποιώ	[khrisimopió],	χρησιμοποιώ,	we	said,	was	“I	use”.	I	use.		
	
S:	 Χρησιμοποιώ.		
	
T:	 And	 we	 also	 saw	 we	 had	 the	 adjective,	 χρήσιμο,	 χρήσιμος,	 χρήσιμη	 [khrísimo,	
    khrísimos,	khrísimi],	meaning	“useful”.	There’s	no	“χρησιμοπιοάω”	[khrisimopiáo]	
    –	 this	 doesn’t	 exist,	 only	 “χρησιμοποιώ”,	 so	 we	 know	 that	 we	 have,	 εσείς,	 the	
    “you”	plural,	formal:	Εσείς	...	?		
	
S:	 Χρησιμοποιείτε	[khrisimopi-íte].		
	
T:	 Χρησιμοποιείτε	[khrisimopiíte].	Good,	with	two	[i]	sounds,	no?	Because	we	have	
    “χρησιμοποιώ”,	and	we	get	rid	of	the	O	(-ώ)	[ó],	and	put	“-είτε”	[íte],	which	gives	
    us	two	[i]	sounds:	χρησιμοποιείτε.	Will	you	guys	use	it?		


                                                                                              407
	
S:	 Θα	το	χρησιμοποιείτε;	[tha	to	khrisimopiíte?].		
	
T:	 This	 would	 be	 like,	 “Will	 you	 guys	 be	 using	 it?”,	 no?	 Which	 could	 work	 in	 some	
    context;	but	just,	Will	you	guys	use	it?	–	as	a	closed	time.		
	
S:	 Θα	το	χρησιμοποιήσετε;	[tha	to	khrisimopi-ísete?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	We	go	back	to	“ετε”	[ete],	no,	when	we	are	out	of	our	standard	form.	
    Θα	το	χρησιμοποιήσετε;	[tha	to	khrisimopiísete?].		
	
	 So,	 we	 have	 an	 [i]	 sound	 from	 the	 verb,	 χρησιμοποιώ	 [khrisimopió],	 and	 an	 [i]	
    sound	from	the	“-ήσ-”	[-ís-]	that	we	insert	in	the	closed	version	of	the	verb.	And	
    these	two	vowel	sounds	are	treated	like	two	different	syllables.	 So	if	you	say,	“I	
    used”,	you’re	going	to	treat	those	two	[i]	sounds	as	two	different	syllables.	What	
    do	I	mean?		Let’s	give	that	a	try	–	I	used.		
	
S:	 Χρησιμοποιήσα	[khrisimopi-ísa].		
	
T:	 And	which	one	are	you	accenting?		
	
S:	 Χρησιμοποίησα	[khrisimopí-isa].		
	
T:	 Χρησιμοποίησα	 [khrisimopíisa].	 So	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 third	 from	 the	 end,	 no?	
    But	 because	 we	 are	 treating	 these	 two	 [i]’s	 like	 two	 separate	 syllables,	 the	 first	
    one	 takes	 the	 accent	 and	 we	 get,	 Χρησιμοποίησα	 [khrisimopíisa].	 So	 actually	 it	
    feels	like	we	have	the	accent	second	from	the	end.	No?	It’s	only	because	Greeks	
    use	these	two	[i]	sounds	as	two	syllables.	I	didn’t	use	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	χρησιμοποίησα	[dhen	to	khrisimopíisa].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	χρησιμοποίησα.	Χρηιμοποίησα.	And,	I	wasn’t	using	it.	
	
S:	 Δεν	το	χρησιμοπούσα	[dhen	to	khrisimopúsa].		
	
T:	 When	you	add	“-ουσ-“	[ús],	you	shouldn’t	lose	the	[i]	(οι)	sound	of	χρησιμοποι-ώ.	
    No?	That’s	still	there.		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	χρησιμοποιούσα	[dhen	to	khrisimopi-úsa].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 το	 χρησιμοποιούσα	 [dhen	 to	 khrisimopiúsa].	 Δεν	 το	 χρησιμοποιούσα.	 I	
    wouldn’t	use	it?	And	let’s	emphasise	–	let’s	use	the	word	for	“I”,	for	emphasis.	I	
    wouldn’t	use	it.		
	
S:	 Εγώ	δεν	θα	το	χρησιμοποιούσα	[eghó	dhen	tha	to	khrisimopiúsa].		
	



                                                                                               408
T:	 Εγώ	 δεν	 θα	 το	 χρησιμοποιούσα.	 Δεν	 θα	 το	 χρησιμοποιούσα,	 εγώ	 [dhen	 tha	 to	
    khrisimopiúsa,	eghó].	How	would	you	say,	I	didn’t	even	use	it?	What	can	we	use	
    for	this	feeling	of,	didn’t	even?		
	
S:	 Ούτε	που	[úte	pu].		
	
T:	 Ούτε	που.	Ούτε	καν	[úte	kan].	Very	good.	So,	I	didn’t	even	use	it.		
	
S:	 Ούτε	που	το	χρησιμοποιούσα	[úte	pu	to	khrisimopiúsa].		
	
T:	 OK,	that’s,	“I	wasn’t	even	using	it”.	No?	Ούτε	που	το	χρησιμοποιούσα.	No?	So,	I	
    didn’t	even	use	it.	No?	That’s	a	closed	time.		
	
S:	 Ούτε	που	το	χρησιμοποίησα	[úte	pu	to	khrisimopíisa].		
	
T:	 Ούτε	 που	 το	 χρησιμοποίησα.	 I	 didn’t	 even	 use	 it.	 And	 we’re	 not	 using	 the	
    negative,	no?	Ούτε	που	το	χρησιμοποίησα.	What	was,	I	can,	or,	I	am	able?		
	
S:	 Μπόρω	[bóro].		
	
T:	 Μπορώ	[boró].	The	closed	version	of	μπορώ,	is	μπορέσω	[boréso].	Μπορέσω.	So	
    it’s	a	little	weird.	It’s	not,	μπορήσω	[boríso],	as	we	might	expect,	but	μπορέσω.		
	
S:	 Μπορέσω.		
	
T:	 So	we	have	μπορέσω,	for	our	closed	version.	How	would	you	say,	I	was	able?		
	
S:	 Μπορέσ	...	μπορέσα	[borés	…	borésa].		
	
T:	 And	where	does	the	accent	fall?		
	
S:	 Μπόρεσα	[bóresa].		
	
T:	 Μπόρεσα	[bóresa].	No?	We	have	our	accent	third	from	the	end	in	the	past,	with	
    the	exception	of	“-ουσ-”	[ús].		
	
	 Τελικά	 [teliká],	 τελικά,	 means	 “finally”,	 or	 “in	 the	 end”,	 and	 that’s	 used	 quite	
    often	in	conversation.	Τελικά	–	finally;	in	the	end.		
	
S:	 Τελικά.		
	
T:	 Like,	τελειώνω	[telióno]	–	“I	finish”,	no?	How	would	you	say,	I	couldn’t	in	the	end?		
	
S:	 Τελικά	δεν	μπόρεσα	[teliká	dhen	borésa].		
	
T:	 Τελικά	δεν	μπόρεσα.	Δεν	μπόρεσα	τελικά	[dhen	borésa	teliká].		I	 couldn’t	 do	 it	 in	
    the	end.	I	couldn’t	do	it	in	the	end.		


                                                                                          409
	
S:	 Τελικά	 δεν	 το	 ...	 δεν	 μπόρεσα	 να	 το	 κάνω	 [teliká	 dhen	 to	 …	 dhen	 bóresa	 na	 to	
    káno].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	We	think	about	those	two	parts	separately,	no?	Τελικά	δεν	μπόρεσα	
    να	το	κάνω.	I	couldn’t,	να,	do	it	–	να	το	κάνω.	So	the	“το”	[to],	when	it	occurs.	But	
    of	course,	when	we	say,	“I	was	able”,	or	“I	wasn’t	able”,	“I	couldn’t“,	referring	to	
    the	past,	in	English,	we	might	be	referring	to	an	open	time	or	a	closed	time.	So	we	
    were	building	the	closed:	μπόρεσα.	How	would	be	that	open	feeling	of	“could”?		
	
S:	 Μπορούσα	[borúsa].		
	
T:	 Μπορούσα.	 So,	 “I	 couldn’t	 do	 it”,	 and	 we	 mean,	 like,	 over	 a	 period	 of	 time	 –	
    maybe	in	the	context	of	describing	a	situation	of	trying	to	get	something	done	or,	
    you	know,	it	really	depends	on	the	context.	So	how	would	that	be?	I	couldn’t	do	it;	
    I	was	not	able	to	do	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορούσα	να	το	κάνω	[dhen	borúsa	na	to	káno].		
	
T:	 Δεν	μπορούσα	να	το	κάνω.	So,	most	of	the	time	with	“could”,	you	can	use	either	
    open	 or	 closed	 –	 the	 open	 or	 closed	 past.	 And	 it’s	 just	 about	 the	 way	 you	 are	
    imagining	the	time	in	whatever	you	are	describing,	no,	which	we’ve	thought	about	
    and	discussed	a	fair	bit.		
	
	 But	also,	apart	from	those	two	different	types	of	past,	“could”	in	English	can	also	
    refer	to	future,	no,	like	in	the	hypothetical	future.	“Could”	can	mean	“I	was	able”	
    (past),	or	“I	would	be	able”.	“Could”	means	both	in	English.	Compare,	“I	couldn’t	
    do	 it	 yesterday,	 but	 I	 could	 do	 it	 tomorrow”.	 And	 in	 both	 situations	 we	 use	
    “could”.	So	let’s	build	that	in	Greek.	First,	I	couldn’t	do	it	yesterday.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπορέσα	...	Δεν	μπόρεσα	να	το	κάνω	χθες	[…	dhen	bóresa	na	to	káno	chthes].		
	
T:		Very	good.	Δεν	μπόρεσα	να	το	κάνω	χθες.	Δεν	μπορούσα	να	το	κάνω	χθες	[dhen	
    borúsa	 na	 to	 káno	 chthes].	 Even	 though	 “χθες”	 is	 a	 closed	 period,	 what	 we	 are	
    referring	to,	you	know,	might	be	an	ongoing	attempt.	It	really	depends	on	what’s	
    in	our	minds.	So,	Δεν	μπόρεσα	(δεν	μπορούσα)	να	το	κάνω	χθες	...	but	I	could	do	
    it	tomorrow.	So	this	“could”,	in,	“but	I	could	do	it	tomorrow”,	is:	I	would	be	able	to	
    do	it	tomorrow.	So	we	need	“would”.	I	would	be	able?		
	
S:	 Θα	μπορούσα	[tha	borúsa].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	μπορούσα.	I	would	be	able	to	do	it	tomorrow.		
	
S:	 Θα	μπορούσα	να	το	κάνω	αύριο	[tha	borúsa	na	to	káno	ávrio].		
	




                                                                                            410
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μπόρεσα	(δεν	μπορούσα)	να	το	κάνω	χθες,	αλλά	θα	μπορούσα	να	
    το	κάνω	αύριο	[dhen	bóresa	(dhen	borúsa)	na	to	káno	chthes,	alá	tha	borúsa	na	to	
    káno	ávrio].	Good.		
	
	 So	 for	 “would”,	 no;	 to	 build	 “would”,	 we	 have	 our	 open	 past	 with	 “θα”:	 Θα	
    μπορούσα	–	“I	would	be	able”	–	“I	could”,	when	we	are	referring	to	the	future.	So	
    when	we	want	“could”	in	Greek,	we	have	to	think	about	that;	we	have	to	think,	do	
    I	mean	in	the	past,	or	do	I	mean	in	the	future,	no?	Or	just	do	I	mean,	“I	was	able”,	
    or	do	I	mean	“I	would	be	able”,	which	is	maybe	a	simpler	way	of	thinking	about	it.		
	
	 So,	 if	 you	 say	 something	 like,	 “I	 couldn’t	 love	 him”,	 well	 this	 could	 be	 either,	
    depending	on	the	context.	You	might	mean,	“I	wasn’t	able	to	love	him”.	So	give	
    me	that	–	I	wasn’t	able	to	love	him.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μπόρεσα	να	…	να	τον	αγαπήσω	[dhen	bóresa	na	…	na	ton	aghapíso].		
	
T:		Δεν	μπόρεσα	(or,	δεν	μπορούσα	[dhen	borúsa])	να	τον	αγαπήσω.	And,	I	couldn’t	
    love	him,	meaning,	I	wouldn’t	be	able	to	love	him?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	μπορούσα	να	τον	αγαπήσω	[dhen	tha	borúsa	na	ton	aghapíso].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	θα	μπορούσα	να	τον	αγαπήσω.	So	a	sentence	like,	“I	couldn’t	love	
    him”,	by	itself,	we	don’t	know	if	it	refers	to	the	past	or	the	future	in	English,	but	
    we	do	in	Greek,	and	we	need	to	think	about	that.	Δεν	μπόρεσα	(δεν	μπορούσα)	
    να	 τον	 αγαπήσω	 [dhen	 bóresa	 (dhen	 borúsa)	 na	 ton	 aghapíso];	 or,	 Δεν	 θα	
    μπορούσα	να	τον	αγαπήσω	[dhen	tha	borúsa	na	ton	aghapíso].

	 Απαντώ	 [apandó]	 or	 απαντώ	 [apadó]	 in	 Greek	 is	 “I	 answer”.	 Απαντώ,	 απαντώ	
    [apandó,	apadó].		
	
S:	 Απαντώ.		
	
T:	 So	again	we	have	NT	(ντ)	in	the	middle	of	the	word,	which	can	give	us	ND	[nd]	or	
    just	D	[d],	depending	on	the	dialect	and	age	group	as	well.	I	think	with	just	the	D	
    [d],	mostly,	is	more	common	with	young	people.	I	have	the	habit	of	putting	with	
    the	 N,	 as	 my	 exposure	 to	 the	 Greek	 of	 the	 Diaspora,	 but	 it	 really	 depends	 on	
    where	you	are	and	who	you’re	speaking	to.	And	this	is	a	verb,	of	course,	with	its	
    accent	on	the	end,	so	we	would	be	looking	out	for	–	Oh,	is	there	also,	απαντάω	
    [apandáo],	 απαντάω	 [apadáo]?	 And	 there	 is	 with	 this	 verb.	 We	 have,	 απαντώ	
    [apandó],	απαντάω	[apandáo].		
	
S:	 Απαντάω	[apandáo].		
	
T:	 So,	You	answer,	is	(informal)?		
	
S:	 Απαντείς	[apandís].		
	
T:	 We	have,	απαντάω,	απαντάω	[apandáo,	apadáo],	no?	Which	means	...	?		
	
S:	 Απαντάς	[apandás].		
	
T:	 Απαντάς.	 No?	 So	 you	 may	 have	 come	 across	 first,	 απαντώ	 [apandó],	 no?	 But	
    always	with	these	verbs	that	have	the	accent	on	the	end,	you	need	to	suspect	that	
    they	might	have	A’s	(α)	[a],	popping	up,	until	you	find	a	version	of	the	verb	that	
    can	confirm	it	for	you.	No?	So	when	you	see	απαντάς	[apandás],	that	confirms	it.	
    If	you	were	to	see,	απαντούμε	[apandúme]	–	“we	answer”	–	would	that	confirm	
    something	for	you	about	the	verb?		
	
S:	 I	don’t	think	so.		
	
T:	 It	 wouldn’t,	 no?	 Because	 you	 could	 have,	 απαντούμε	 [apandúme]	 or,	 απντάμε	
    [apandáme],	 so	 it	 doesn’t	 tell	 us	 anything.	 But	 if	 you	 see,	 απαντάτε	 [apandáte],	
    does	this	confirm	something	for	you?		
	
S:	 Yes.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	Ηe	answers	(She	answers)?		
	
S:	 Απαντάει	[apandái].		
	
T:	 Απαντάει	or,	απαντά	[apandá].	What	we	know	we	don’t	have	is,	απαντεί	[apandí],	
    no?	Because	we	have	the	[a]	(α).	So	what	is	the	closed	version	of,	απαντάω?		
	
S:	 Απαντήσω	[apandíso].		


                                                                                            413

T:	 Θα	απαντούσα	χθες.		
	
	 The	word	for	“sorry”	or	“excuse	me”	is,	συγγνώμη	[sighnómi].	Συγγνώμη.		
	
S:	 Συγγνώμη.		
	
T:	 Good.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say	 sorry	 for	 something	 like,	 “Sorry	 I	 didn’t	 answer	
    yesterday”,	 you	 could	 say,	 Συγγνώμη	 που	 [sighnómi	 pu],	 and	 then	 just,	 “I	 didn’t	
    answer	yesterday”.	So,	Sorry	I	didn’t	answer	yesterday?		
	
S:	 Συγγνώμη	που	δεν	απάντησα	χθες	[sighnómi	pu	dhen	apándisa	chthes].

    couldn’t	answer	yesterday.		
	
S:	 Συγγνώμη	που	δεν	μπορέσα	...	[sighnómi	pu	dhen	borésa	…	].	
	
T:	 I	 think	 you	 decided	 halfway	 through	 the	 word,	 which	 one	 you	 will	 use,	 no?	
    Maybe?	Sο	I	think	you	need	to	decide	beforehand,	if	you	will	use	the	open	or	the	
    closed	time,	so	you	don’t	kind	of	mash	together	elements	from	both	of	them.		
	
S:	 Συγγνώμη	που	δεν	μπόρεσα,	δεν	μπόρεσα	να	απαντήσω	χθες	[sighnómi	pu	dhen	
    bóresa,	dhen	bóresa	na	apandíso	chthes].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Συγγνώμη	που	δεν	μπόρεσα	να	απαντήσω	χθες.	Όπου	δεν	μπoρούσα	
    να	απαντήσω	χθες	[ópu	dhen	borúsa	na	apandíso	chthes].	I	want	you	to	answer	
    me.	 And	 here	 we’re	 going	 to	 say,	 I	 want	 you	 to	 answer	 to	 me.	 Let’s	 speak	
    informally.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	με	…	να	μου	απαντήσεις	[thélo	na	me	…	na	mu	apandísis].		


                                                                                           414
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	μου	απαντήσεις	[thélo	na	mu	apandísis].	So	this	is	interesting,	no?	We	
    have	to	answer,	“to	me”,	even	though	when	we	ask	(“ρωτάω”	[rotáo]),	when	we	
    use	ρωτάω,	we	say	“με”	[me]	or	“σε”	[se],	no,	rather	than	“μου”	[mu]	and	“σου”	
    [su].	So	we	ask	directly	somebody,	but	then	we	answer	to	somebody	in	Greek.	So	
    this	 is	why	 listening	 is	important,	 no?	 Because	logic	won’t	 always	take	us	to	 the	
    correct	decision	–	if	we	need	“με”	or	“μου”,	“σε”	or	“σου”.	So	we	want	to	listen	
    out	all	the	time,	and	notice	when	we	hear	one	or	the	other,	and	think	about	why.	
    And	in	this	way	we	constantly	revise	what	we	know.		
	
	 I	want	you	to	answer	me	before	tomorrow.	For	“before	tomorrow”,	we	wοuld	say	
    “until	tomorrow”,	in	Greek:	Μέχρι	αύριο	[mékhri	ávrio]	–	“until	tomorrow”.		
	
S:	 Μέχρι	αύριο.		
	
T:	 So,	I	want	you	to	answer	me	before	tomorrow.

    tomorrow.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μου	απαντήσετε	μέχρι	αύριο	[thélo	na	mu	apandísete	mékhri	ávrio].

Teacher:	“The	road”	in	Greek	was	…	?		
	

Student:	O	δρóμος	[o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 O	δρóμος,	no,	like	hippodrome,	like	syndrome,	no,	(“with	road”),	which	refers	to,	
    like,	a	set	of	symptoms	running	their	course	–	ο	δρóμος.	This	road?		
	
S:	 Αυτóς	ο	δρóμος	[aftós	o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Αυτóς	ο	δρóμος	–	“this	the	road”,	no,	or	“he	the	road”,	in	Greek.	So	this	is	in	“he”	
    position	–	αυτóς	ο	δρóμος.		
	
	 What	was	“I	take”?		
	
S:	 Πάρω	[páro].		
	
T:	 This	is	the	closed	form.		
	
S:	 Παίρνω	[pérno].		
	
T:	 Παίρνω.	 Good.	 So	 we	 have,	 παίρνω	 [pérno]	 and	 πάρω	 [páro],	 no,	 for	 “I	 take”.	
    How	would	you	say,	You	have	to	take	this	road?	So,	“αυτóς”	[aftós]	and	“δρóμος”	
    [dhrómos]	are	going	to	behave	differently	here,	when	you	say,	You	have	to	take	
    this	road.	Αυτóς	is	going	to	behave	like	“the”,	and	δρóμος	is	just	going	to	behave	
    like	a	masculine	noun.	So	let’s	give	this	a	try.	You	have	to	take	this	road.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	πάρεις	αυτόν	τον	δρóμο	[prépi	na	páris	aftón	ton	dhrómo].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πρέπει	να	πάρεις	αυτόν	τον	δρóμο.	So	we	have	“δρóμο”	[dhrómo]	and	
    “αυτόν”	 [aftón]	 behaving	 differently,	 no?	 “Αυτόν”	 behaves	 like	 “τον”	 [ton],	 and	
    “δρóμο”	just	behaves	like	a	masculine	noun.		
	
	 The	 same	 with	 the	 word	 “άλλος”,	 which	 means	 “other”.	 No?	 So	 if	 you	 say,	 for	
    example,	You	have	to	take	the	other	road,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	πάρεις	τον	άλλον	δρóμο	[prépi	na	páris	ton	álon	dhrómo].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πρέπει	να	πάρεις	τον	άλλον	δρóμο.	Although	I	have	to	say	that	this	is	kind	
    of	falling	out	of	use	as	well.	So	you	might	hear	just	“άλλο”	[álo],	“τον	άλλο”	[ton	
    álo],	 with	 or	 without	 the	 N	 (ν).	 And	 with	 the	 feminine,	 for	 example,	 you	 don’t	
    really	hear	“άλλην”	[álin]	–	maybe	in	a	few	dialects	of	Greek.	But	you	don’t	hear	
    άλλην,	for	example,	in	this	situation,	just	άλλη.	So	you	can	see	actually	that	this	is	
    in	 the	 process	 of	 falling	 out	 of	 use	 in	 Greek.	 No?	 But	 you	 should	 be	 aware	 that	
    some	words	will	behave	like	“the”,	no,	rather	than	just	like	any	adjective	or	noun;	



                                                                                               416
   and	that	some	of	those	words	–	well,	sometimes	they	will	do	it,	sometimes	they	
   won’t.	It	will	depend	on	the	dialect	and	the	speaker.		
	
	 So	we	have	δρóμος	[dhrómos]	for	“road”	and	οδóς	[odhós]	for	“street”,	which	is	
    feminine	–	η	οδóς	[i	odhós].	So	this	is	feminine,	and	I	did	mention	that	many	of	
    these	“-ος”	[os]	nouns	that	are	feminine	are	actually	places,	no?	Like	η	έξοδος	[i	
    éksodhos]	–	“the	exit”;	η	είσοδος	[i	ísodhos]	–	“the	entrance”;	η	Κύπρος	[i	kípros]	
    –	“the	Cyprus”.	And	street	is	much	more	like	a	place	than	a	road,	no?	If	you	think	
    about	it,	when	you	refer	to	a	street,	it’s	much	more	about	the	place	than	when	
    you	refer	to	a	road.	So	here	we	have,	η	οδóς.	This	won’t	always	happen,	no,	but	
    it’s	interesting	to	notice	the	pattern.	And	then	when	you	find	a	noun	that	has	a	
    gender	that	you	don’t	expect	it	to	have,	you	can	just	have	a	look	if	you	can	find	a	
    reason	 why,	 or	 work	 out	 your	 own	 patterns.	 And	 just	 thinking	 about	 that	 will	
    internalise	 the	 fact	 that	 you	 have	 a	 gender	 with	 that	 particular	 word	 that	 you	
    didn’t	expect.	So,	η	οδóς	[i	odhós]	–	“the	street”.	How	would	you	say,	His	street?		
	
S:	 Η	οδóς	του	[i	odhós	tu].		
	
T:	 Η	 οδóς	 του.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 “Giorgos’s	 street”,	 you	 can	 say,	 Η	 οδóς	 του	
    Γιώργου	[i	odhós	tu	yórghu].		
	
	S:	Η	οδóς	του	Γιώργου.		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	we	have	the	“-ος”	[os]	noun,	Γιώργος	[yórghos]	–	it’s	just	like	any	other	
    masculine	 noun	 ending	 “-ος”	 [os],	 also	 ending	 “-ου”	 [u],	 to	 match	 “του”	 [tu].	 Η	
    οδóς	 του	 Γιώργου.	 Do	 you	 know	 where	 is	 Giorgos’s	 street?	 Do	 you	 know	 where	
    Giorgos’s	street	is?		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	που	είναι	η	οδóς	του	Γιώργου;	[kséris	pu	íne	i	odhós	tu	yórghu?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ξέρεις	που	είναι	η	οδóς	του	Γιώργου;	And	what	if	you	are	speaking	to	
    more	than	one	person?	Do	you	guys	know	where	Giorgos’s	street	is?		
	
S:	 Ξέρετε	που	είναι	η	οδóς	του	Γιώργου;	[ksérete	pu	íne	i	odhós	tu	yórghu?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Ξέρετε	 που	 είναι	 η	 οδóς	 του	 Γιώργου;	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 Do	 you	
    know	which	…	do	you	know	which	is	the	street	of	Giorgos?	Do	you	know	which	is	
    Giorgos’s	street?	So	what	was	the	word	for	“which”?		
	
S:	 Ποιος	[pyos].		
	
T:	 Ποιος,	no,	for	masculine.	And	for	feminine,	how	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Ποιη	[pyi].		
	
T:	 So	most	words	take	[i]	(η)	for	feminine,	but	not	“ποιος”.		
	


                                                                                            417
S:	 Ah.	Ποια	[pya].		
	
T:	 Ποια.	Good.	So	those	are	our	two	main	feminine	endings,	no,	[i]	(η)	and	[a]	(α),	
    and	 here	 we	 have	 [a]	 (α)	 –	 ποια	 [pya].	 So,	 Do	 you	 know	 which	 is	 the	 street	 of	
    Giorgos?	Do	you	know	which	is	Giorgos’s	street?		
	
S:	 Ξέρετε	ποια	είναι	η	οδός	του	Γιώργου;	[ksérete	pya	íne	i	odhós	tu	yórghu?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Still	talking	plurally,	or	formally.	Ξέρετε	ποια	είναι	η	οδός	του	Γιώργου;	
    And	we	use	ποια	[pya],	because	“η	οδός“	is	feminine.	And	what	if	you	were	to	just	
    say,	Do	you	know	Giorgos’s	street?	Let’s	still	speak	formally	or	plurally.		
	
S:	 Ξερετε	την	οδό	...	Yes.	Ξέρετε	την	οδό	του	Γιώργου;	[ksérete	tin	odhó	tu	yórghu?].		
	
T:	 Ξέρετε	 την	 οδό	 του	 Γιώργου;	 Very	 good.	 So	 we	 have	 “την”	 [tin],	 because	 it’s	
    behaving	like	“her”	now,	rather	than	“she”;	“οδό”	[odhó],	because	we	lose	the	S	
    (ς).	Even	though	this	“-ος”	[os]	noun	is	actually	feminine,	we	do	still	lose	the	S	(ς):	
    την	οδό	του	Γιώργου.	Ξέρετε	την	οδό	του	Γιώργου;	[ksérete	tin	odhó	tu	yórghu?].		
	
	 Οδηγώ	 [odhighó],	 οδηγώ,	 is	 “I	 drive”.	 So,	 this	 is	 of	 course	 connected	 to	 “οδός”	
    [odhós]	–	οδηγώ.		
	
S:	 Οδηγώ.		
	
T:	 So	 this	 is	 “I	 drive”,	 and	 also	 can	 be	 used	 like,	 “to	 lead	 to”,	 no?	 If	 you	 say,	 for	
    example,	 “It	 leads	 to	 a	 big	 stairway”,	 no?	 You	 can	 use,	 οδηγώ.	 Well,	 in	 the	 “it”	
    form,	no?	“Stairway”	or	“stairs”	is,	η	σκάλα	[i	skála],	η	σκάλα.	So	that’s	feminine,	
    like	 “scale”,	 but	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 musical	 scale	 of	 course,	 not	 a	 …	 not	 a	 weighing	
    scale.	A	musical	scale	goes	up	like	a	stairway	–	σκάλα.	So	how	would	you	say,	It	
    leads	to	a	big	stairway?		
	
S:	 Οδηγεί	στην	μεγάλη	σκάλα	[odhiyí	stin	megháli	skála].		
	
T:	 Good.	That	would	be,	It	leads	to	the	big	stairway”.	But	how	would	you	say,	to	a	
    big	stairway?		
	
S:	 Οδηγεί	σε	ένα	μεγάλη	σκάλα	[odhiyí	se	éna	megháli	skála].		
	
T:	 Okay?		
	
S:	 No	...	σε	μία	μεγάλη	σκάλα	[se	mía	megháli	skála].		
	
T:	 Good.	Οδηγεί	σε	μία	μεγάλη	σκάλα	[odhiyí	se	mía	megháli	skála].	Good.	So	“μία”	
    [mía],	 once	 upon	 a	 time,	 in	 Greek,	 would	 have	 taken	 an	 N	 (ν);	 it	 would	 have	
    behaved	like	the	word	for	“the”.	No?	And	you	would	have	had	“μίαν”	[mían].	But	
    like	I	say,	with	this	happening	with	other	words	that	aren’t	the	word	for	“the”,	it’s	
    in	a	process	of	falling	out	of	use.	So,	μίαν,	with	an	N	(ν),	behaving	like	“her”,	you	


                                                                                                   418
   don’t	 really	 find	 it	 anymore.	 You	 might	 come	 across	 it	 in	 some	 old	 writings,	 but	
   you’re	not	likely	to	hear	it,	for	example.	So	we	said,	like,	Giorgos’s	street	is,	η	οδός	
   του	Γιώργου	[i	odhós	tu	yórghu].	How	would,	My	friend’s	street,	be?		
	
S:	 Η	οδός	του	φίλου	μου	[i	odhós	tu	fílu	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Η	οδός	του	φίλου	μου.	How	would	you	say,	It	leads	to	the	street	of	my	
    friend?	–	like	a	path	or	something.	It	leads	to	the	street	of	my	friend,	to	my	friend’s	
    street.		
	
S:	 Οδηγεί	στην	οδό	του	φίλου	μου	[odhiyí	stin	odhó	tu	fílu	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Οδηγεί	στην	οδό	του	φίλου	μου.	Very	good.		So	 with	 these	 “-ος”	 [os]	
    nouns,	like	φίλος	[fílos],	like	Γιώργος	[yórghos],	we	also	have	this	extra	change	of	
    matching	 them	 with	 “του”.	 So,	 the	 street	 of	 my	 friend;	 my	 friend’s	 street:	 του	
    φίλου	μου	[tu	fílu	mu].	My	friend’s	house:	το	σπίτι	του	φίλου	μου	[to	spíti	tu	fílu	
    mu].	 Giorgos’s	 house:	 το	 σπίτι	 του	 Γιώργου	 [to	 spíti	 tu	 yórghu].	 And	 this	 is	 with	
    [os]	(-ος)	nouns,	no?	Φίλος,	Γιώργος	[fílos,	yórghos]	–	του	φιλου,	Γιώργου	[tu	fílu,	
    yórghu].	 Otherwise,	 we	 will	 just	 lose	 the	 S	 (ς).	 So,	 if	 you	 say,	 for	 example,	
    Μιχάλης’s	house	(the	house	of	Μιχάλης)?		
	
S:	 Το	σπίτι	του	Μιχάλη	[to	spíti	tu	mikháli].		
	
T:	 Το	σπίτι	του	Μιχάλη.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	It	leads	to	Μιχαλης’s	house?		
	
S:	 Οδηγεί	στο	σπίτι	του	Μιχάλη	[odhiyí	sto	spíti	tu	mikháli].		
	
T:	 Οδηγεί	στο	σπίτι	του	Μιχάλη.	Do	you	know	how	to	drive?	So	we	don’t	need	“how”	
    here.	We	will	just	say,	Do	you	know	–	να	[na]	–	you	drive.		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	να	οδηγείς;	[kséris	na	odhiyís?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Ξέρεις	 να	 οδηγείς;	 Do	 you	 know	 to	 drive?	 Ξέρεις	 να	 οδηγείς;	 So	 you	
    were	 using,	 οδηγεί,	 οδηγείς	 [odhiyí,	 odhiyís],	 which	 means	 you	 took	 a	 decision	
    about	this	verb	with	an	accent	on	the	end,	no	–	that	it	doesn’t	have	any	A’s	(α)	
    popping	 up;	 and	 you	 were	 correct	 too.	 So	 we	 know	 that	 if	 we	 say,	 Do	 you	 guys	
    know	 how	 to	 drive?,	 we	 know	 what	 ending	 we	 will	 have	 for	 the	 “you”	 plural	 or	
    “you”	 formal.	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be?	 Do	 you	 know	 how	 to	 drive?	 –	 speaking	
    formally	to	somebody,	or	speaking	to	more	than	one	person.	Do	you	know	how	to	
    drive?		
	
S:	 Ξέρετε	να	οδηγήσετε;	[ksérete	na	odhiyísete?].		
	
T:	 	So	 before	 you	 said,	 Ξέρεις	 να	 οδηγείς;	 You	 used	 the	 open	 form,	 which	 makes	
    sense	–	because	we’re	not	referring	to	a	closed	time,	no?	It’s	very	general.	Do	you	
    know	how	to	drive?	So	again.		
	


                                                                                               419
S:	 Ξέρετε	να	οδηγείτε;	[ksérete	na	odhiyíte?].		
	
T:	 Ξέρετε	 να	 οδηγείτε;	 Very	 good.	 And	 in	 both	 of	 the	 “-γείς”	 [yís]	 or	 the	 “-γείτε”	
    [yíte],	 we	 have	 the	 γάμα	 [gháma]	 (γ)	 very	 soft	 there,	 no,	 because	 of	 the	 “εί”	 [i]	
    sound	after.	Ξέρεις	να	οδηγείς;	[kséris	na	odhiyís?].	Ξέρετε	να	οδηγείτε;	[ksérete	
    na	odhiyíte?].	Very	good.		
	
	                                 	




                                                                                                420
Complete Greek, Track 87 – Language Transfer
	
Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	there,	in	Greek?		
	
Student:	Εκεί	[ekí].		
	
T:	 Εκεί.	And,	that	one,	masculine,	for	example?		
	
S:	 Εκείνος	[ekínos].		
	
T:	 Εκείνος.	That	road.		
	
S:	 Εκείνο	o	δρόμος,	ο	δρόμο	...	Εκείνος	ο	δρόμος	[ekínos	o	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Yeah.	When	we	think	of	nouns	in	their	standard	form,	no,	we	can	think	of	them	as	
    “he”.	No?	So,	εκείνος	ο	δρόμος	[ekínos	o	dhrómos].	We	have	to	take	that	road.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	πάρουμε	εκείνον	τον	δρόμο	[prépi	na	párume	ekínon	ton	dhrómo].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 πάρουμε	 εκείνον	 τον	 δρόμο.	 So,	 as	 you	 rightly	 did,	 we	 have	
    “εκείνον”	 [ekínon]	 behaving	 like	 “the”,	 like	 τον	 [ton],	 no,	 with	 the	 N	 (ν).	 How	
    would	 you	 say,	 That	 new	 road?	 So	 for	 “new”,	 we	 could	 have	 νέος	 [néos],	 or	
    maybe	 more	 common	 you	 …	 you	 would	 hear,	 καινούργιος	 [kenúrios].	 That	 new	
    road	–	that,	the	new	road.		
	
S:	 Εκείνος	ο	καινούργιος	δρόμος	[ekínos	o	kenúrios	dhrómos].		
	
T:	 Εκείνος	ο	νέος	δρόμος	[ekínos	o	néos	dhrómos].	Εκείνος	ο	καινούργιος	δρόμος.	
    How	would	you	say,	We	have	to	take	that	new	road?	We	have	to	take	that	new	
    road.		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	πάρουμε	εκείνον	τον	καινούργιον	δρόμο	[prépi	na	párume	ekínon	ton	
    kenúrion	dhrómo].		
	
T:	 Why	 did	 “καινούργιον”	 [kenúrion]	 behave	 like	 the	 words	 for	 “the”?	 It	 was	 a	 bit	
    automatic,	maybe.	No?		
	
S:	 Yeah.		
	
T:	 OK.	So	the	adjectives	and	the	nouns,	they	will	behave	in	the	same	way:	they	will	
    just	 drop	 the	 S	 (-ς),	 when	 they	 are	 in	 “him”	 form.	 So	 give	 that	 another	 try.	 We	
    have	to	take	that	new	road.		
	
	S:	Πρέπει	να	πάρουμε	εκείνον	τον	καινούργιο	δρόμο	[prépi	na	párume	ekínon	ton	
    kenúrio	dhrómo].		
	



                                                                                               421
T:	 Very	 good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 πάρουμε	 εκείνον	 τον	 καινούργιο	 δρόμο.	 How	 would	 you	
    say,	We	have	to	take	those	new	roads?	We	have	to	take	those	new	roads.	
	
S:	 Πρέπει	 να	 πάρουμε	 εκείνους	 τους	 καινούργιοι	 δρόμοι	 [prépi	 na	 párume	 ekínus	
    tus	kenúri-i	dhrómi].		
	
T:	 So	 the	 “-ος”	 [os]	 nouns	 also	 change	 actually,	 no,	 when	 they	 are	 behaving	 like	
    “them”.	What	…	what,	change	do	we	see	in	“-ος”	[os]	nouns?		
	
S:	 They	become	“-ους”	[us].		
	
T:	 “-ους”	[us].	So	actually	for	different	reasons	here,	we	are	going	to	have	everything	
    sounding	 the	 same,	 no?	 Εκείνους	 [ekínus]	 is	 behaving	 like	 τους	 [tus];	 that	 “-ος”	
    [os]	nouns	and	adjectives	also	end	“-ους”	when	they’re	behaving	like	“them”.	So	
    here	everything	is	going	to	sound	very	similar.	So	let’s	do	that	again.	We	have	to	
    take	those	new	roads	(those	the	new	roads).		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	 να	 πάρουμε	 εκείνους	 τους	 καινούργιους	 δρόμους	 [prépi	 na	 párume	
    ekínus	tus	kenúrius	dhrómus].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Πρέπει	 να	 πάρουμε	 εκείνους	 τους	 καινούργιους	 (or	 νέους	 [néus])	
    δρόμους.	So,	ο	δρόμος,	is	“the	road”,	and	“the	street”	was?		
	
S:	 Η	όδος	[i	ódhos].		
	
T:	 Η	οδός	[i	odhós],	with	the	accent	on	the	end.	Η	οδός.	How	would	you	say,	This	is	
    Giorgos’s	street?	This	is	the	street	of	Giorgos.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	η	οδό	του	…	του	Γιώργου	[aftí	íne	i	odhó	tu	…	tu	yórghu].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	why	“η	οδό”	[i	odhó]?	If	you	were	deciding	it’s	acting	like	“her”,	then	at	
    least	you	should	be	coherent,	no,	and	put	“την	οδό”	[tin	odhó].	But	it’s	not.	Here	
    it’s	behaving	like	“she”:	“this	is	she”,	rather	than	“this	is	her”,	although	that	can	
    be	difficult	to	decide,	no?	So	with	the	verb	for	“to	be”,	we	don’t	have	nouns	acting	
    like	“her”	or	“him”,	no?	It’s	always	in	the	standard	form.	So,	again,	This,	this	one	…	
    and	I	liked	that	you	used	the	feminine,	αυτή	[aftí],	no?	This	is	Giorgos’s	street.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	η	οδός	του	Γιώργου	[aftí	íne	i	odhós	tu	yórghu].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτή	είναι	η	οδός	του	Γιώργου.	Νο?	So	with	“-ος”	[os]	nouns,	no,	we	have	
    them	 matching	 “του”	 and	 “τους”	 actually.	 We	 saw,	 for	 example,	 Εκείνους	 τους	
    νέους	δρόμους	[ekínus	tus	néus	dhrómus],	and	then,	του	Γιωργου	[tu	yórghu].	So	
    with	 “-ος”	 [os]	 nouns,	 no,	 when	 they	 go	 with	 “του”	 and	 “	 τους”,	 they	 match	 at	
    “του”	or	“	τους”.	This	is	my	friend’s	street.	This	is	the	street	of	my	friend.	
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	η	οδός	του	φίλου	μου	[aftí	íne	i	odhós	tu	fílu	mu].		
	


                                                                                            422
T:	 Very	good.	Αυτή	είναι	η	οδός	του	φίλου	μου.	This	is	the	street	of	my	friend.		
	
	 This	is	the	street	of	that	man	we	saw	in	the	centre.	This	is	the	street	of	that	man	
    we	saw	in	the	centre.	So	…	This	is	the	street?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	είναι	η	οδός	[aftí	íne	i	odhós].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	 είναι	 η	 οδός	 ...	 of	 that	 man.	 So,	 of	 that	 man	 –	 “of”,	 the	 meaning	 of	 “of”,	
    we’re	including	in	“that	man”.		
	
S:	 Του	άντρα	[tu	ándra].		
	
T:	 Good;	but	we	want	“that	man”.		
	
S:	 Tου	εκείνου	άντρα	[tu	ekínu	ándra].		
	
T:	 Good;	but	what	order	does	“that”	always	go	in?	So,	to	…	to	solve	your	own	doubt,	
    you	go	back	to	the	most	basic	place.	So	how	do	you	say,	This	man,	or,	That	man?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	ο	άντρας	[aftós	o	ándras].		
	
T:	 Αυτός	ο	άντρας;	εκείνος	ο	άντρας	[ekínos	o	ándras].	And	that	gives	you	the	order,	
    no?	That	the	man.		
	
S:	 Okay.	So,	Eκείνου	του	άντρα	[ekínu	tu	ándra].		
	
T:	 	Very	good.	Eκείνου	του	άντρα.	So,	άντρα	[ándra],	because	I	said	“-ος”	[os]	nouns	
    will	change	to	match	that	“-ου”	[u];	otherwise	they	just	lose	their	S	(-ς).	So,	Aυτή	
    είναι	η	οδός	[aftí	íne	i	odhós]	–	This	is	the	street	...	εκείνου	του	άντρα	[ekínu	tu	
    ándra]	–	of	that	man.	No?	So	we,	we	could	have	“του”	for	“his	street”:	η	οδός	του,	
    no	–	the	street	to	him;	or,	εκείνου	του	άντρα,	to	say,	you	know,	“of	that	man”	–	
    the	street	to	that	man.	Aυτή	είναι	η	οδός	εκείνου	του	άντρα	[aftí	íne	i	odhós	ekínu	
    tu	ándra]	...	that	we	saw	in	the	centre;	which	(that	which),	we	saw	in	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Που	είδαμε	στο	κέντρο	[pu	ídhame	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Aυτή	 είναι	 η	 οδός	 εκείνου	 του	 άντρα	 που	 είδαμε	 στο	 κέντρο	 [aftí	 íne	 i	
    odhós	ekínu	tu	ándra	pu	ídhame	sto	kéndro].		
	
	 “To	fix”,	or,	“to	put	something	together”,	like	to	fix	something	to	eat,	or	to	fix	a	
    drink	is,	φτιάχνω	[ftiákhno].	Φτιάχνω.		
	
S:	 Φτιάχνω.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	F-T	(φ-τ)	[ft],	which	is	a	combination	we	don’t	have	in	English	when	you	
    start	a	word.	No?	We	have	it	in	the	middle,	like	“often”.	But	to	start	a	word,	you	
    wouldn’t	find	this	in	English.	So	this	is	an	interesting	sound	to	make	in	Greek,	like,	


                                                                                               423
   φτάνω	[ftáno]	–	“I	arrive”.	Φτιάχνω	...	and	then	we	have	the	[kh]	(χ)	also,	but	at	
   the	end	of	the	syllable.	Φτιάχνω	–	“I	fix”.	Φτιάχνω.		
	
S:	 Φτιάχνω.		
	
T:	 And	the	closed	version	is,	φτιάξω	[ftiákso].	Φτιάξω.		
	
S:	 Φτιάξω.		
	
T:	 How	was,	a	coffee?		
	
S:	 Ένας	καφές	[énas	kafés].		
	
T:	 Ένας	 καφές.	 So	 “ένας”	 [énas]	 doesn’t	 change	 like	 any	 old	 adjective	 or	 noun,	
    dropping	the	S	(-ς)	when	it’s	like	“him”,	rather	than	“he”.	It	behaves	like	the	word	
    for	 “the”;	 it	 becomes	 “έναν”	 [énan],	 when	 it’s	 like	 “him”.	 So	 if	 you	 want	 to	 say,	
    Can	you	fix	me	a	coffee?	How	would	that	be?	So	for	“fix”,	in	this	sense,	we	have,	
    φτιάχνω	[ftiákhno],	and	the	closed	version,	φτιάξω	[ftiákso].	So,	Can	you	fix	me	a	
    coffee?		
	
S:	 Μπορείς	να	μου	φτιάξεις	έναν	καφέ;	[borís	na	mu	ftiáksis	énan	kafé?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μπορείς	να	μου	(because	it’s	“for	me”,	“to	me”,	no,	rather	than	fixing	
    me,	directly)	…	μπορείς	να	μου	φτιάξεις	έναν	καφέ;	Very	good.	Can	you	make	a	
    coffee	for	my	friend	(a	male	friend).	Can	you	make	a	coffee	for	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Μπορείς	να	φτιάξεις	έναν	καφέ	για	τον	φίλο	μου;	[borís	na	ftiáksis	énan	kafé	ya	
    ton	fílo	mu?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μπορείς	να	φτιάξεις	έναν	καφέ	για	τον	φίλο	μου;	Very	good.	So	we’ve	
    seen	how	“to	me”	–	μου	[mu],	“to	you”	–	σου	[su],	“to	him”	–	του	[tu],	“to	her”	–	
    της	[tis],	can	be	used	for	possession,	no,	like	when	we	say,	το	σπίτι	μου	[to	spíti	
    mu],	το	σπίτι	της	[to	spíti	tis].	And	we’ve	expanded	that	concept	a	little,	like	with:	
    το	 σπίτι	 του	 Γιώργου	 [to	 spíti	 tu	 yórghu]	 –	 “the	 house	 of	 Giorgos”;	 το	 σπίτι	 του	
    φίλου	μου	[to	spíti	tu	fílu	mu]	–	“the	house	of	my	friend	(my	friend’s	house)”.		
	
	 And	you	will	also	notice	this	“ου”	[u]	with	some	surnames	in	Greek,	especially	in	
    Cyprus.	This	is	because	when,	traditionally,	people	chose	a	surname,	they	would	
    be	 “of	 their	 father”	 –	 son	 of	 (or	 daughter	 of)	 whoever.	 And	 you	 can	 even	 find	
    people	that	have	the	same	name	twice,	no,	but	like	different	versions	of	it.	So,	for	
    example,	 you	 could	 have	 “Chrisóstomos	 Chrisostómou”	 (Χρυσόστομος	
    Χρυσοστόμου),	 no?	 This	 would	 be	 Chrisostomos	 of	 Chrisostomos.	 But	 in	 the	
    second	one,	you	see	Chrisostomou,	ending	[u]	(“-ου”),	for	the	surname,	meaning	
    “of”.	So	you	will	find	a	lot	of	surnames	ending	“-ου”,	and	this	can	remind	you	of	its	
    function	as,	“of”	something	or	someone.		
	
	 What	was	the	word	for,	more?		


                                                                                               424
	
S:	 Πιο	[pyo].		
	
T:	 Πιο.	And,	which,	or	who?		
	
S:	 Also,	ποιο	[pyo].		
	
T:	 Ποιο,	ποιος,	ποια	[pyo,	pyos,	pya].	No?	Or	in	the	plural,	ποιοι	[pyi]	–	ποιοι,	for	the	
    masculine	plural,	ποιες	[pyes]	for	the	feminine	plural,	ποια	[pya]	for	the	neuter.	
    So	 ποιο	 [pyo]	 is	 “who”	 or	 “which”.	 And	 if	 you	 think	 about	 it,	 “who”	 just	 means	
    “which”	–	just	means	“which	person”,	no?	So	we	use,	ποιο,	ποια,	ποιος,	for	…	for	
    both	of	these	meanings	in	Greek.	How	would	you	say,	Who	is	this	coffee	for	(For	
    who	is	this	coffee)?	But	there	are	only	females	present,	so	we	will	say,	you	know,	
    “for	which	/	for	who	“	in	the	feminine.	For	who	is	this	coffee?		
	
S:	 Για	ποια	είναι	αυτός	ο	καφές;	[ya	pya	íne	aftós	o	kafés?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Για	ποια	είναι	αυτός	ο	καφές;	Νο?	So,	“αυτός	ο	καφές”	–	in	the	“he”	form;	
    (“he	is	for”).	But,	like	I	mentioned,	with	“to	be”	(είναι,	είμαι,	είσαι	[íne,	íme,	íse],	
    etc.),	will	we	always	just	have	our	standard	forms	of	nouns.	How	would	you	say,	
    For	who	are	these	coffees?	And	we	are	still	just	with	women.	For	who	are	these	
    coffees?		
	
S:	 Για	ποια	είναι	αυτοί	οι	καφέδες;	[ya	pya	íne	aftí	i	kafédhes?].		
	
T:	 This	 is	 possible,	 but	 it	 would	 only	 mean,	 if	 all	 of	 the	 coffees	 were	 just	 for	 one	
    person.	In	Greek,	as	we	have	the	option	to	put	“who”	in	the	plural,	we	will	when	it	
    makes	sense.	So	if	all	of	these	coffees	aren’t	just	for	one	of	these	ladies,	no,	we	…	
    we	will	say	“for	who”,	in	the	plural.	So	let’s	do	that	again.	Who	are	these	coffees	
    for.	For	who	are	these	coffees	(and	we	mean	females)?		
	
S:	 Για	ποιες	είναι	αυτοί	οι	καφέδες;	[ya	pyes	íne	aftí	i	kafédhes?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Για	ποιες	είναι	αυτοί	οι	καφέδες;	And	if	we	asked,	For	who	is	it?	–	and	
    we	mean	a	man;	or	also,	if	we	are	not	aware	of	the	gender,	no?	For	“who”,	we	can	
    just	use	the	masculine,	like	a	neuter.	So,	For	who	is	it?	And	we	mean	a	man,	or	not	
    specifying	the	gender.		
	
S:	 Για	πoιον	είναι;	[ya	pyon	íne?].		
	
T:	 Για	πoιον	είναι;	You	decided	that	“πoιος”	[pyos]	acts	like	“τον”,	rather	than	any	
    other	adjective	or	noun;	and	you	were	correct.	Of	course,	ποιος	–	”who”,	is	much	
    closer	 to	 “τον”,	 the	 word	 for	 “the”	 or	 “him”,	 than	 any	 old	 adjective	 or	 noun.	 So	
    rather	than	just	losing	the	S	(-ς),	we	get	an	N	(-ν):	Για	πoιον	είναι;	[ya	pyon	íne?].	
    And,	For	who	is	it?	–	in	the	plural,	for	masculine	or	mixed.	For	who	is	it?		
	
S:	 Για	πoιους	είναι;	[ya	pyus	íne?].		


                                                                                                425
	
T:	 Για	πιους	είναι;	Very	good.	If	you	want	to	say,	“Whose	is	it?”	–	like,	“Who	does	it	
    belong	to?”	–	you	can	say,	ποιανού	[pyanú].	Ποιανού.		
	
S:	 Ποιανού.		
	
T:	 So,	Whose	is	it?		
	
S:	 Ποιανού	είναι;	[pyanú	íne?].		
	
T:	 Ποιανού	είναι;	–	this	meaning	something	like,	Οf	who	is	it?.	No?	We	can	see	the	
    “ου”	[u]	there,	but	we	also	have	like	an	N	(ν)	popping	up.	You	can	also	say,	“ποιου	
    είναι;”	 [pyu	 íne?].	 That	 would	 also	 make	 sense,	 as	 “Οf	 who	 is	 it?”,	 as	 well.	 But	
    “ποιανού”	[pyanú]	is	much	more	common.		
	
	 And	 this	 idea	 of	 possession	 that	 we’re	 seeing	 is	 not	 necessarily	 about	 owning	
    things;	it’s	more	broadly	to	do	with	the	meaning	of,	“of”.	So,	you	know,	when	we	
    say,	“my	friend’s	house”,	we	are	saying,	“the	house	of	my	friend”,	and	there	we	
    mean	 somebody	 owns	 something.	 But	 in	 the	 same	 way	 we	 can	 also	 say,	 “the	
    problems	 of	 the	 world”,	 no?	 So	 this	 kind	 of	 possessive	 structure	 that	 we’re	
    learning	is	not	just	about	literal	possession;	we	can	use	it	much	more	broadly.		So,	
    what	was,	the	problem?	The	problem.		
	
S:	 Το	πρόβλημα	[to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόβλημα.	And,	the	problems?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματα	[ta	provlímata].		
	
T:		Τα	 προβλήματα.	 So	 with	 those	 neuter	 words	 ending	 A	 (α),	 we	 can’t	 make	 them	
    plural	with	A	(α),	so	we	add	“τα”	[ta]	on	the	end	–	just	like	the	word	for	“the”:	τα	
    προβλήματα.	 The	 word	 for	 “world”,	 world,	 like	 in	 “cosmopolitan”	 is,	 κόσμος	
    [kózmos].	This	is	spelt	with	an	S	(σ)	in	Greek,	but	we	hear	a	Z	[z]	before	that	M	(μ).	
    Κοσμος,	the	world.	O	κόσμος	[o	kózmos].	So	how	would	you	say,	The	problems	of	
    the	world?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματα	του	κόσμου	[ta	provlímata	tu	kózmu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τα	προβλήματα	του	κόσμου.	So	you	can	really	use	the	structure	a	lot	
    in	Greek.	And	also,	you	need	to	be	aware	of	…	that	it’s	going	in	a	different	order	to	
    how	you	think	about	it	in	English.	So	to	really	access	this	structure,	you	will	need	
    to	have	this	awareness	of	the	fact	that	you	will	think	of	it	in	a	different	way.	You	
    will	 say,	 maybe,	 “the	 world’s	 problems”,	 no,	 and	 be	 thinking:	 How?	 I	 can’t	 say	
    that.	 How	 can	 I	 say	 that	 in	 Greek?	 Until	 you	 realise:	 Oh,	 okay,	 it’s	 just,	 “the	
    problems	of	the	world”.	Τα	προβλήματα	του	κόσμου.	Very	good.		
	
	                                 	


                                                                                               426
Complete Greek, Track 88 – Language Transfer
	
Teacher:	“I	go”,	I	go,	in	Greek	is,	πηγαίνω	[piyéno].		
	
Student:	Πηγαίνω.		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνω.		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνω.		
	
T:	 So	this	Y	[y]	sound	is	just	the	γάμα	[gháma]	(γ),	no,	with	the	[e]	(αι)	sound	after	it,	
    being	 softened.	 Πηγαίνω	 –	 “I	 go”.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I’m	 going	 to	 my	 friend’s	
    house	–	and	we	mean	a	male	friend?		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνω	στο	σπίτι	του	φίλου	μου	[piyéno	sto	spíti	tu	fílu	mu].		
	
T:	 	Very	 good.	 Πηγαίνω	 στο	 σπίτι	 του	 φίλου	 μου.	 Good.	 Πηγαίνω	 …	 πηγαίνω,	 also	
    has	a	shorter	version:	πηγαίνω	–	the	whole	thing	kind	of	gets	swallowed	up	into,	
    πάω	[páo].	Πάω.		
	
S:	 Πάω.		
	
T:	 So,	πηγαίνω,	such	a	long	word	for	such	a	common	verb,	that	managed	to	kind	of	
    contract	to,	πάω.	So,	πηγαίνω	[piyéno]	and	πάω	[páo]	both	exist.	And	we	know	
    that	 G’s	 (γ),	 like	 in	 πηγαίνω,	 can	 get	 swallowed	 away	 easily	 –	 like	 we	 have,	 λέω	
    [léo],	I	…	“I	say”	or	“I	tell”.	And	then	we	saw	that	it	actually	has	a	hidden	G	(γ),	like	
    in	the	past,	έλεγα	[élegha],	or	like	in	other	versions,	διαλέγω	[dhialégho].	Tρώω	
    [tróo]	–	“I	eat”;	and	then,	έτρωγα	[étrogha]	–	“I	was	eating”.	So	we	can	see	how	
    that	can	happen.	So,	πηγαίνω,	or	πάω	–	I	am	going.	What	was	the	word	for,	all?		
	
S:	 ‘Ολα	[óla].		
	
T:	 Good.	‘Ολα.	What	version	of	it	did	you	give	me?		
	
S:	 Ah.	That’s	the	neuter.		
	
T:	 The	neuter	...	?		
	
S:	 The	neuter	plural.		
	
T:	 The	 neuter	 plural.	 Okay,	 as	 long	 as	 we	 are	 aware	 of	 that,	 no?	 “Every	 day”,	 we	
    could	have,	κάθε	μέρα	[káthe	méra]	–	“each	day”;	or	we	could	also	have,	“all	the	
    days”.	So	you	can	use	either.	Κάθε	μέρα,	for	“every	day”,	or	“all	the	days”.	How	
    would,	All	the	days,	be?		
	
S:	 ‘Ολες	οι	μέρες	[óles	i	méres].		
	


                                                                                               427
T:	 ‘Ολες	οι	μέρες.	Very	good.	And	how	would	you	say,	I	go	every	day?		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνω	όλες	τις	μέρες	[piyéno	óles	tis	méres].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνω	 όλες	 τις	 μέρες.	 Πάω	 όλες	 τις	 μέρες	 [páo	 óles	 tis	 méres].	 And	 here	 we	
    have,	τις	μέρες	[tis	méres],	no?	Because	when	we	say	“every	day”,	I	go	every	day,	
    we	mean,	on	every	day;	and	that’s	“on	them”,	rather	than	“on	they”.	So,	mostly	
    with	time	expressions,	no,	when	we	say	when	we	do	something,	we	have	them	in	
    the	“her”,	rather	than	the	“she”	form;	in	the	“him”,	rather	than	the	“he”	form.	So,	
    Πάω	(πηγαίνω)	όλες	τις	μέρες	[páo	(piyéno)	óles	tis	méres].		
	
	 But	if	we	say,	κάθε	μέρα	[káthe	méra],	for	example,	we	don’t	need	to	worry	about	
    that.	 In,	 κάθε	 μέρα,	 there’s	 nothing	 there	 that’s	 going	 to	 change,	 depending	 on	
    whether	it’s	behaving	like	“he”	or	“him”,	or	“she”	or	“her”.	He	goes	to	his	friend’s	
    house	every	day.		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνει	στο	σπίτι	του	φίλου	κάθε	μέρα	[piyéni	sto	spíti	tu	fílu	káthe	méra].		
	
T:	 Good.	But,	“to	his	friend’s	house”.		
	
S:	 Στο	σπίτι	του	φίλου	του	κάθε	μέρα	[sto	spíti	tu	fílu	tu	káthe	méra].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πηγαίνει	στο	σπίτι	του	φίλου	του	κάθε	μέρα	[piyéni	sto	spíti	tu	fílu	tu	
    káthe	méra].	And	apart	from	“πηγαίνει”	[piyéni],	we	could	also	have	“πάει”	[pái].	
    So	“πάω”	becomes	“πάει”	for	“he”	or	“she”	or	“it”.	How	would	you	say,	She	goes	
    to	 her	 friend’s	 house	 every	 day?	 Still	 a	 masculine	 friend	 but,	 She	 goes	 to	 her	
    friend’s	house	every	day.		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνει	 στο	 σπίτι	 του	 φίλου	 της	 κάθε	 μέρα	 [piyéni	 sto	 spíti	 tu	 fílu	 tis	 káthe	
    méra].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πηγαίνει	(or	πάει	[pái])	στο	σπίτι	του	φίλου	της	κάθε	μέρα.	This	“-ου”	
    [u]	ending,	to	match	“του”	[tu],	like	in	“του	φίλου”	[tu	fílu],	is	only	with	“-ος”	[os]	
    nouns.	Otherwise,	we	will	just	drop	the	S	(-ς)	of	the	masculine	noun.	So	if	you	say	
    for	example,	The	house	of	the	man	–	how	is	that?		
	
S:	 Το	σπίτι	του	άντρα	[to	spíti	tu	ándra].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	σπίτι	του	άντρα.	So	we	just	drop	the	S	(-ς)	from	“άντρας”.		
	
	 “I	teach”	is,	διδάσκω	[dhidhásko].	Διδάσκω	–	I	teach.		
	
S:	 Διδάσκω.		
	
T:	 Like	“didactic”,	in	English.	Didactic	–	it’s	got	to	do	with	teaching.	How	would	you	
    say,	He	teaches	Greek?		
	


                                                                                            428
S:	 Διδάσκει	Ελληνικά.	[dhidháski	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Good.	Διδάσκει	Ελληνικά.	He	used	to	teach	Greek.		
	
S:	 Δίδασκε	Ελληνικά	[dhídhaske	eliniká].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δίδασκε	 Ελληνικά.	 So	 we	 just	 use	 our	 standard	 “διδάσκω”,	 no,	 our	
    open	 standard	 form	 of	 the	 verb,	 and	 we	 put	 the	 accent	 back	 and	 use	 our	 past	
    ending.	Δίδασκε.	Δίδασκε	Ελληνικά.	He	used	to	teach	/	She	used	to	teach,	Greek.		
	
	 What	do	you	think	the	closed	version	of	“διδάσκω”	might	be?	So	we	can	look	at	
    “didactic”,	no,	in	English,	and	see	if	we	can	find	in	“didactic”,	anything	that	looks	
    like	one	of	the	possibilities	we	have	for	building	our	closed	version.		
	
S:	 I	suspect	it’s	going	to	turn	into	a	[ks]	(ξ).		
	
T:	 Yes.	Why?		
	
S:	 The	X	and	the	C	–	the	K-sound	are	very	similar.		
	
T:	 Yeah,	 of	 course,	 in	 “didactic”,	 we	 have	 the	 [k],	 no,	 on	 the	 stressed	 syllable,	
    “didactic”,	and	that	can	make	us	suspect	that	from	διδάσκω	[dhidhásko],	we	will	
    have,	διδάξω	[dhidhákso].	So	actually,	the	S	(σ)	and	the	Κ	(κ)	of	“διδάσκω”	switch	
    around	in	the	closed	form	–	διδάξω.	But	in	“διδάσκω”,	S-K	are	two	letters	(σ-κ);	
    and	then	in	“διδάξω”,	[ks]	K-S	is	just	one	letter	(ξ).	How	would	you	say,	He	taught?		
	
S:	 Δίδαξε	[dhídhakse].		
	
T:	 Δίδαξε.	How	again	was,	I	go,	or,	I’m	going?		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνω	[piyéno].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνω,	or	...	?		
	
S:	 Πάω	[páo].		
	
T:	 Πάω.	“The	teacher”	is,	ο	δάσκαλος	[o	dháskalos].	O	δάσκαλος.		
	
S:	 O	δάσκαλος.		
	
T:	 “The	 teacher’s	 house”	 is,	 Tο	 σπίτι	 του	 δασκάλου	 [to	 spíti	 tu	 dhaskálu],	 το	 σπίτι	
    του	 δασκάλου.	 Do	 you	 notice	 anything	 odd	 here?	 Ο	 δάσκαλος.	 Το	 σπίτι	 του	
    δασκάλου?		
	
S:	 Yes.	The	accent	moves	back	from,	δάσκαλος	[dháskalos]	to,	δασκάλου	[dhaskálu].		
	



                                                                                            429
T:	 So	 forward,	 no?	 But	 it	 moves;	 it	 gets	 closer	 to	 the	 end.	 Ο	 δάσκαλος,	 του	
    δασκάλου.	And	this	didn’t	happen	before,	no,	when	we	said,	το	σπίτι	του	φίλου,	
    το	σπίτι	του	φίλου	μου	[to	spíti	tu	fílu	mu].	We	went	from,	ο	φίλος	[o	fílos]	to,	του	
    φίλου	[tu	fílu];	τα	προβλήματα	του	κόσμου	[ta	provlímata	tu	kózmu];	ο	κόσμος	/	
    του	κόσμου	[o	kózmos,	tu	kózmu].	Here	the	accent	didn’t	change.	So	with	longer	
    nouns,	this	“-ου”	[u]	can	pull	the	accent	closer	to	it.	This	can	happen	with	longer	
    nouns,	like,	δάσκαλος	/	του	δασκάλου	[dháskalos,	tu	dhaskálu].		
	
	 So	 you	 should	 pay	 attention	 in	 Greek	 for	 accents,	 stresses,	 moving	 for	
    grammatical	reasons,	let’s	say.	We	saw	it	in	the	past:	we	pulled	the	accent	back	
    into	 the	 past.	 And	 make	 sure	 it’s	 the	 third	 syllable	 from	 the	 end	 when	 we	 build	
    our	 past.	 With	 those	 neuter	 words	 we	 get	 the	 plural,	 by	 adding	 “τα”	 onto,	 no,	
    when	 they	 are	 longer	 as	 well.	 This	 can	 make	 the	 accent	 move.	 We	 saw,	 το	
    πρόβλημα	[to	próvlima],	and	then,	τα	προβλήματα	[ta	provlímata].	No?	So	we’ve	
    seen	a	few	examples	of	this.		
	
	 And	now	we	see	it	here	again.	So	when	we	have	a	longer	noun	ending	“-ος”	[os],	
    and	we	change	that	to	“-ου”	[u],	we	cοuld	see	that	accent	moving:	o	δάσκαλος	/	
    του	 δασκάλου	 [ο	 dháskalos,	 tu	 dhaskálu].	 So	 don’t	 try	 to	 memorise	 where	 this	
    happens	 –	 just	 be	 aware	 that	 it	 does	 happen	 in	 Greek,	 that	 this	 is	 a	 feature	 of	
    Greek,	 that	 you	 may	 see	 accents	 moving	 around	 when	 you	 change	 words.	 And	
    look	out	for	it,	so	you	can	get	reminded	live,	of	when	an	accent	might	move.		
	
	 You	 can	 also	 find	 various	 hooks	 to	 remind	 you	 of	 when	 this	 happens.	 So,	 for	
    example,	I	mentioned	“Χρυσόστομος	Χρυσοστόμου”	[khrisóstomos	khrisostómu],	
    Χρυσοστόμου,	no?	That	you	might	see	somebody	with	the	same	first	and	second	
    name,	 and	 see	 the	 accent	 move	 in	 the	 name.	 So	 there	 we	 can	 have	 a	 very	 nice	
    example,	 Χρηστόστομος,	 and	 then,	 Χρηστοστόμου,	 of	 how	 the	 accent	 moves	 in	
    that	longer	word,	because	the	“-ος”	[os]	changes	to	“-ου”	[ou].		
	
	 So	when	we	come	across	these	things,	listening	and	practising	Greek,	we	should	
    think	about	why	an	accent	has	moved	when	we	notice	it,	and	this	way	remind	us	
    of	 the	 occasions	 that	 this	 happens	 in;	 and	 revise	 these	 peculiarities	 on	 the	 go,	
    rather	than	worrying	about	memorising	them	all.		
	
	                                 	




                                                                                               430

Teacher:	 So	 we’ve	 seen	 various	 situations	 in	 which	 the	 accent	 moves	 in	 Greek	 to	
    show	us	something:	be	it	in	the	past,	when	we	pull	the	accent	back;	be	it	with	the	
    neuter	 plural,	 when	 we	 add	 “τα”,	 instead	 of	 changing	 O	 (o)	 to	 A	 (α);	 with	 the	
    longer	 nouns,	 the	 accent	 can	 move.	 So	 we	 can	 have,	 for	 example,	 το	 πρόβλημα	
    [to	 próvlima],	 and	 then,	 τα	 προβλήματα	 [ta	 provlímata];	 the	 “τα”	 on	 the	 end	
    there,	pulls	the	accent	towards	it.		
	
	 We’ve	 seen	 that	 when	 we	 have	 “-ου”	 [u]	 for	 our	 ending	 of	 “of”,	 like	 “of	 my	
    friend”,	φίλου	[fílu],	no?	When	this	goes	onto	a	longer	word,	it	can	pull	the	accent	
    towards	it,	like	in,	ο	δάσκαλος	[o	dhaskálos]	–	“the	teacher”,	and,	του	δασκάλου	
    [tu	dhaskálu]	–	“of	the	teacher”;	or,	άνθρωπος	[ánthropos],	like	in	anthropology	–	
    “the	 person”,	 του	 ανθρώπου	 [tu	 anthrópu]	 –	 “of	 the	 person”.	 So	 we’ve	 seen	
    various	situations	in	which	the	accent	may	move	in	Greek.		
	
	 We	 also	 have	 an	 important	 situation	 in	 which	 the	 accent	 may	 double	 –	 so,	 not	
    move,	but	double.	This	can	happen	when	we	put	a	word	like,	μου,	του,	σoυ	[mu,	
    tu,	 su],	 etc.,	 for	 possession,	 on	 longer	 words.	 So,	 for	 example,	 what	 is,	 the	
    problem?		
	
Student:	Το	πρόβλημα	[to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόβλημα.	“My	problem”	is,	το	πρόβλημά	μου	[to	próvlimá	mu].	Το	πρόβλημά	
    μου.	 So	 when	 we	 put	 “μου”	 [mu]	 on	 “πρόβλημα”,	 it	 actually	 gets	 a	 secondary	
    accent.	 The	 accent	 doesn’t	 move;	 it	 gets	 two.	 And	 both	 are	 actually	 written	 as	
    well.	So	we	have,	το	πρόβλημα,	and	then,	το	πρόβλημά	μου.	So	this	actually	helps	
    connect	 the	 idea	 in	 sound:	 το	 πρόβλημα	 –	 το	 πρόβλημά	 μου.	 So	 we	 know	 that	
    that’s	“my	problem”,	rather	than,	 το	πρόβλημα	 (the	problem)	μου	(to	me	–	and	
    then	something	else).	That	helps	us	in	comprehension	and	listening,	to	group	that	
    “μου”	with,	το	πρόβλημα:	το	πρόβλημά	μου.	How	would	you	say,	His	problem?		
	
S:	 Το	πρόβλημά	του	[to	próvlimá	tu].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόβλημά	του.	The	car;	how	is,	the	car?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο	[to	aftokínito].		
	
T:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο.	Her	car?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητό	της	[to	aftokínitó	tis].		
	
T:	 So	 with	 these	 longer	 words,	 we’re	 raising	 the	 accent	 again	 toward	 the	 end,	 and	
    helping	in	comprehension	to	understand	the	“της”	is	about	the	car,	and	not	about	
    something	else.	Το	αυτοκίνητο,	το	αυτοκίνητό	της	[to	aftokínitο,	to	aftokínitó	tis].	
    Very	good.	So	this	is	only	in	simple	constructions,	no?	When	we	say,	for	example,	
    “her	 car”,	 “his	 car”;	 but	 if	 you	 say	 “the	 car	 of	 Giorgos”,	 then	 you	 don’t	 have	 to	


                                                                                                431
   worry	about	moving	the	accent	any	more.	Only	if	you	say	“his	car”,	“her	car”,	“my	
   car”.	So	how	would	you	say	that?	The	car	of	Giorgos;	Giorgos’s	car?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο	του	Γιώργου	[to	aftokínito	tu	yórghu].		
	
T:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο	του	Γιώργου.	But	just,	His	car?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητό	του	[to	aftokínitó	tu].		
	
T:	 Το	αυτοκίνητό	του.	His	problem?		
	
S:	 Το	πρόβλημά	του	[to	próvlimá	tu].		
	
T:	 Το	 πρόβλημά	 του.	 Το	 πρόβλημά	 του.	 But	 if	 you	 say,	 Giorgos’s	 problem,	 rather	
    than,	his	problem?		
	
	S:	Το	πρόβλημα	του	Γιώργου	[to	próvlima	tu	yórghu].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόβλημα	του	Γιώργου.	So	here,	because	we	have,	Giorgos’s	problem,	rather	
    than,	 his	 problem,	 we	 don’t	 need	 to	 worry	 about	 doubling	 the	 accent.	 It’s	 only	
    when	we	use	“του”,	“μου”,	etc.,	by	itself.	How	would	you	say,	The	car	of	my	friend	
    (my	friend’s	car)?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητο	του	φίλου	μου	[to	aftokínito	tu	fílu	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	αυτοκίνητο	του	φίλου	μου.	But	just,	his	car?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκινητό	του	[to	aftokinitó	tu].		
	
T:	 Here	it	sounded	like	you	moved	the	accent	to,	το	αυτοκινητό	του.	But	we	need	to	
    hear	both:	το	αυτοκίνη	...	το	αυτοκίνητό	του	[to	aftokínitó	tu].	Your	car?		
	
S:	 Το	αυτοκίνητό	σου	[to	aftokínitó	su].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	αυτοκίνητό	σου.	Your	problem?		
	
S:	 Το	πρόβλημά	σου	[to	próvlimá	su].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόβλημά	σου.	Good.	But	just,	the	problem?		
	
S:	 Το	πρόβλημα	[to	próvlima].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόβλημα.	And,	problems?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματα	[ta	provlímata].		
	



                                                                                           432
T:	 Προβλήματα.	So	here	we	have	the	accent	moving	because	we’re	adding	“-τα”	[ta]	
    for	 the	 plural	 –	 but	 not	 only	 because	 we’re	 adding	 “-τα”,	 but	 because	 we’re	
    adding	 “-τα”	 on	 a	 longer	 word,	 no?	 Χρώμα	 [khróma]	 –	 “colour”,	 and	 “χρώματα	
    [khrómata];	we	didn’t	see	the	accent	move,	for	example.	So,	τα	προβλήματα.	How	
    would	you	say,	her	problems?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματά	της	[ta	provlímatá	tis].		
	
T:	 I	think	you	were	putting	the	secondary	accent,	no?	Or	not?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματά	της.	Τα	προβλήματά	της.		
	
T:	 Good.	So	even	there	we	have	two	accents;	we	have	the	one	of,	τα	προβλήματα,	
    and	 then	 again	 on	 the	 end.	 Pulling	 it	 all	 together:	 τα	 προβλήματά	 της	 [ta	
    provlímatá	tis].	His	problems?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματά	του	[ta	provlímatá	tu].		
	
T:	 Τα	προβλήματά	του.	But,	the	problems	of	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματα	του	φίλου	μου	[ta	provlímata	tu	fílu	mu].		
	
T:	 Τα	προβλήματα	του	φίλου	μου.	And	there	we	separate	it,	’cos	we	are	not	saying,	
    you	 know,	 his	 problems,	 but,	 the	 problems	 of	 my	 friend.	 The	 idea	 goes	 on	 –	 we	
    don’t	try	to	jam	it	all	together:	τα	προβλήματα	του	φίλου	μου,	or,	τα	προβλήματά	
    του.		
	
	 So	 some	 of	 these	 changes	 as	 well	 in	 accent,	 are	 so	 subtle	 that	 native	 speakers	
    often	 don’t	 realise	 that	 they’re	 doing	 it.	 But	 if	 you	 listen	 out	 for	 it,	 you	 will	
    definitely	 notice,	 and	 it	 will	 make	 your	 speech	 sound	 much	 more	 fluent	 and	
    native.	And	also,	as	I	mentioned,	these	accents	are	written.	But,	you	know,	again	if	
    you	read	Greek	on-line,	for	example,	a	lot	of	the	time	you’re	not	going	to	find	all	
    of	the	secondary	accents	written.		
	
	 Το	μάθημα	[to	máthima]	is	“the	course”,	like,	μαθαίνω	[mathéno]	–	“I	learn”.	Το	
    μάθημα	–	“the	course”.	Both	related	to	math,	maths.		
	
S:	 Το	μάθημα.		
	
T:	 My	course?		
	
S:	 Το	μάθημά	μου	[to	máthimá	mu].		
	
T:	 Το	μάθημά	μου.	I	will	do	my	course	at	the	teacher’s	house.	What	was,	the	teacher,	
    again?		
	
S:	 Ο	δάσκαλος	[o	dháskalos].		


                                                                                                433
	
T:	 Ο	δάσκαλος.	So,	I	will	do	my	course.		
	
S:	 Θα	κάνω	το	μάθημά	μου	[tha	káno	to	máthimá	mu].		
	
T:	 Θα	κάνω	το	μάθημά	μου.	In	the	house?		
	
S:	 Στο	σπίτι	[sto	spíti].		
	
T:	 Of	the	teacher.		
	
S:	 Του	δασκάλου	[tu	dhaskálu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good	 ...	 του	 δασκάλου.	 So	 we	 change	 the	 accent	 twice	 here,	 for	 two	
    different	reasons,	no?	We	have,	το	μάθημα	[to	máthima]	and,	το	μάθημά	μου	[to	
    máthimá	mu];	for	the	“μου”	there,	we	are	making	a	secondary	accent.	And	then,	
    ο	δάσκαλος,	and	then	when	we	say	“of	the	teacher”,	we	move	the	accent	on	this	
    longer	word,	ending	“-ος”	[os],	closer	to	“-ος”:	του	δασκάλου	[tu	dhaskálu].		
	
	 So	again,	it	seems	quite	overwhelming	to	look	at	all	of	these	changes	in	accents,	
    no?	But	when	you	pick	them	out	yourself,	live,	just	understanding	that	it	occurs,	
    and	 then	 picking	 it	 out	 yourself,	 live,	 is	 surely	 the	 best	 way	 to	 internalise	 these	
    various	shifts	in	accent.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	go,	or,	I’m	going,	in	Greek?		
	
Student:	Πηγαίνω	[piyéno].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνω.	Or?		
	
S:	 Πάω	[páo].		
	
T:	 Πάω.	He	goes,	or,	She	goes	/	It	goes?		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνει	[piyéni]	or,	πάει	[pái].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνει,	or,	πάει.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	We	go	(We’re	going)?		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνουμε	[piyénume].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνουμε.	And	we	also	have,	πάμε	[páme],	for	our	contracted	version	of	this.	
    Πάμε.		
	
S:	 Πάμε.		
	
T:	 They	are	going;	they	go?		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνουν	[piyénun].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνουν,	or,	πηγαίνουνε	[piyénune].	Πηγαίνουν,	πηγαίνουνε.	And	our	shorter	
    version	here	is,	πάνε	[páne].	Πάνε.		
	
S:	 Πάνε.		
	
T:	 We	couldn’t	have	“πάν”	[pan];	that	would	be	too	short	–	so	just,	πάνε.	You	guys	
    are	going,	or,	You	(formal)	go?		
	
	S:	Πηγαίνετε	[piyénete].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνετε.	 And	 what	 do	 you	 think	 we	 might	 have	 for	 this	 shorter,	 contracted	
    version,	if	we	have,	πάμε,	πάνε	[páme,	páne]?		
	
S:	 Πάτε	[páte].		
	
T:	 Πάτε.	 Good.	 For,	 “you	 (informal)”	 we	 have,	 πηγαίνεις	 [piyénis],	 no?	 And	 for	 the	
    shorter	version,	what	might	we	have?		
	
S:	 Πας	[pas].		
	


                                                                                           435
T:	 Πάς.	Very	good.	So,	apart	from	being	an	alternative	version	of,	πηγαίνω	[piyéno],	
    πάω	[páo],	it’s	also	the	closed	form	of,	πηγαίνω;	so	it’s	both.	You	can	just	use	it	in	
    the	present,	as	you	will,	and	there’s	no	difference	between	“πηγαίνω”	and	“πάω”;	
    they	 mean	 the	 same	 thing,	 no?	 There’s	 no	 difference	 in	 usage,	 whether	 it’s	 an	
    open	or	a	closed	feeling,	or	anything	like	this.	It’s	just	a	contraction	of	“πηγαίνω”,	
    but	that’s	also	used	for	the	closed	form,	no?	So	if	you	say,	for	example,	Will	you	
    go	to	your	friend’s	house;	Will	you	go	to	your	friend’s	house?	How	will	that	be?		
	
S:	 Θα	πάς	στο	σπίτι	του	φίλου	του	...	του	φίλου	σου;	[tha	pas	sto	spíti	tu	fílu	tu	…	tu	
    filu	su?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	πάς	στο	σπίτι	του	φίλου	σου;	[tha	pas	sto	spíti	tu	filu	su?].	Good.	
    How	would	you	say,	I’m	going	to	my	best	friend’s	house?	I	am	going	to	the	house	
    of	my	best	friend	(a	male	friend).		
	
S:	 Πάω	στο	σπίτι	του	καλήτερο	μου	φίλο	...	φίλου	[páo	sto	spíti	tu	kalítero	mu	fílo	…	
    fílu].		
	
T:	 OK.	So	give	that	bit	another	go.	Στο	σπίτι	του	[sto	spíti	tu]	...	?		
	
S:	 Του	καλήτερον	μου	φίλου	[tu	kalíteron	mu	fílu]?		
	
T:	 Καλήτερον	[kalíteron]?		
	
S:	 I	thought	“καλήτερο”	[kalítero],	but	apparently	it’s	wrong.	So?		
	
T:	 So	 you	 are	 thinking	 to	 remove	 the	 S	 (-ς)	 from	 “καλήτερος”	 [kalíteros]	 here,	 no?	
    Because	we	would	have,	καλήτερος	φίλος	[kalíteros	fílos],	and	you	are	taking	the	
    S	(-ς)	away.	But	we	have,	του	φίλου	[tu	fílu],	no?	So	what	will	happen	to	...	?		
	
S:	 So	it’s,	Θα	πάω	στο	σπίτι	του	καλήτερου	μου	φίλου	[tha	páo	sto	spíti	tu	kalíteru	
    mu	fílu]?		
	
T:	 Good.	And	where	are	you	putting	the	accent	there	on	“το	σπίτι	του	...	”?		
	
S:	 Kαλήτερού	...	?		
	
T:	 Yes.		
	
S:	 Καλήτερού	μου	[kalíterú	mu].		
	
T:	 Yes.	Καλήτερού	μου.	Ah	...	because	we	have	“καλήτερος”	–	we	already	have	the	
    accent	 on	 the	 [í]	 (-ή-),	 and	 then	 because	 we	 have	 the	 “μου”	 there,	 it’s	 going	 to	
    come	up	again	to	join,	καλήτερού	μου	[kalíterú	mu],	all	together.	And	we	have	to	
    think	of	it	as	something	joined	together;	otherwise,	that	double	accent	business	
    becomes	very	difficult,	no?	Although,	like	I	say,	it’s	not	very	important	to	do	it;	but	
    if	you	have	a	particular	desire	to	have	a	native	feel	to	your	Greek,	then	you	want	


                                                                                               436
   to	pay	attention	to	this	kind	of	thing.	So,	Πάω	στο	σπίτι	του	καλήτερού	μου	φίλου	
   [páo	sto	spíti	tu	kalíterú	mu	fílu].	That’s	how	it	connects	in	meaning,	and	in	sound:	
   του	καλήτερού	μου	φίλου.		
	
	 And	also	the	position	of	“μου”	is	flexible.	So	whilst	the	position	of	“μου”	is	more	
    common	after	the	adjective	in	something	like	this	–	του	καλήτερού	μου	φίλου	[tu	
    kalíterú	mu	fílu]	–	you	could	also	put	the	“μου”	at	the	end,	and	then	you	won’t	
    have	to	worry	about	the	accent	of,	καλήτερος	[kalíteros],	no?	You’ll	just	have,	του	
    καλήτερου	φίλου	μου	[tu	kalíteru	fílu	mu].		
	
	 How	would	you	say,	her	problems?		
	
S:	 Τα	προβλήματά	της	[ta	provlímatá	tis].		
	
T:	 Τα	προβλήματά	της.	Her	house?		
	
S:	 Το	σπίτι	της	[to	spíti	tis].		
	
T:	 Το	σπίτι	της.	So,	with	a	smaller	word	like	“σπίτι”,	we	don’t	have	to	worry	about	
    making	any	secondary	accents,	no?	Το	σπίτι	της.		
	
	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say	 “Maria’s	 problems”,	 “Maria’s	 house”,	 “my	 friend’s	 house”,	
    instead	 of	 just	 “her	 house”,	 “her	 problems”	 –	 again,	 we	 say,	 “the	 problems	 of	
    Maria”,	“the	house	of	my	friend”.	So	just	as	we	use,	του	[tu]	–	“to	him”,	for	this	
    structure	 in	 the	 masculine,	 we	 will	 use	 “της”	 [tis],	 like	 “to	 her”,	 for	 this,	 for	 the	
    feminine,	no?	But	the	feminine	noun,	we	also	add	an	S	(-ς)	to.	So,	“the	house	of	
    Maria”	is,	το	σπίτι	της	Μαρίας	[to	spíti	tis	marías].		
	
S:	 Το	σπίτι	της	Μαρίας.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	just	like	in	English,	actually,	when	we	add	apostrophe	“s”	(’s):	Maria,	and	
    then,	Maria’s	house.	It’s	the	same.	But	we	are	only	doing	this	with	the	feminine	in	
    Greek,	the	feminine	singular.	So,	η	Μαρία	[i	maría],	but	then,	το	σπίτι	της	Μαρίας	
    [to	spíti	tis	marías]	–	“Maria’s	house”.	How	would	you	say,	My	friend’s	house?	And	
    you	mean	a	female	friend.		
	
S:	 Το	σπίτι	της	φίλης	μου	[to	spíti	tis	fílis	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	σπίτι	της	φίλης	μου.	So	we	are	using	“της”	in	the	same	way	as	we	
    were	using	“του”;	but	we	also	get	this	S	(-ς)	for	this	feminine	noun.	Το	σπίτι	της	
    φίλης	μου.	We	are	going	to	my	friend’s	house.		
	
S:	 Πάμε	στο	σπίτι	της	φίλης	μου	[páme	sto	spíti	tis	fílis	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Πηγαίνουμε	 (πάμε)	 στο	 σπίτι	 της	 φίλης	 μου	 [piyénume	 (páme)	 sto	
    spíti	 tis	 fílis	 mu].	 And	 I	 should	 also	 mention	 that	 “πάμε”	 can	 be	 used	 like,	 “let’s	
    go”,	all	by	itself.	Πάμε!	You	know,	“Let’s	go!”	So	you	could	say,	Aς	πάμε	[as	páme];	


                                                                                                   437
   Nα	πάμε	[na	páme]	–	but	also	just	“πάμε”,	to	say	“let’s	go”.	Πάμε	στο	σπίτι	της	
   φίλης	μου.		
	
	 Do	you	know	which	is	the	car	of	Maria?	Do	you	know	which	one	is	Maria’s	car?	–	is	
    how	we	would	say	it	in	English,	no?	Do	you	know	which	is	the	car	of	Maria?		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	 ποιο	 είναι	 το	 αυτο	 ...	 το	 αυτοκίνητο	 της	 Μαρίας;	 [kséris	 pyo	 íne	 to	
    aftokínito	tis	marías?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Ξέρεις	ποιο	(and	“ποιο”	[pyo]	in	the	neuter	is	matching	“αυτοκίνητο”),	
    no?	Ξέρεις	ποιο	είναι	το	αυτοκίνητο	της	Μαρίας;	So	if	we	were	to	say,	“her	car”,	
    we	would	say	“το	αυτοκίνητό	της”	[to	aftokínitó	tis]	–	the	accent	would	double.	
    We	would	connect	“της”	and	“αυτοκίνητο”:	το	αυτοκίνητό	της.	But	when	we	say,	
    το	 αυτοκίνητο	 της	 Μαρίας,	 we	 don’t	 do	 that.	 So	 only	 when	 we	 have	 “της,	 μου,	
    του”,	etc.,	connected	only	to	that	noun	it	comes	after,	do	we	have	to	worry	about	
    moving	the	accent.		
	
	 “The	 beginning”,	 the	 beginning,	 like	 in,	 αρχίζω	 [archízo]	 –	 “I	 start”,	 or,	 υπάρχει	
    [ipárchi]	–	“there	is”,	was	“η	αρχή	[i	archí].	H	αρχή.		
	
S:	 Η	αρχή.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	Her	beginning?		
	
S:	 Η	αρχή	της	[i	archí	tis].		
	
T:	 Η	 αρχή	 της.	 Or,	 It’s	 beginning,	 as	 well,	 no?	 If	 we	 are	 talking	 about	 a	 feminine	
    noun,	 it	 could	 be	 the	 beginning	 of	 something.	 For	 example,	 “spring”	 is,	 άνοιξη	
    [ániksi].	Άνοιξη.		
	
S:	 Άνοιξη.		
	
T:	 This	is,	η	άνοιξη	[i	ániksi]	–	“the	spring”.	So	if	you	wanted	to	say,	The	beginning	of	
    spring,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Η	αρχή	της	άνοιξης	[i	archí	tis	ániksis].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Η	 αρχή	 της	 άνοιξης.	 So	 the	 idea	 of	 possession	 here,	 no,	 as	 we’ve	
    mentioned,	 is	 broad	 –	 more	 like	 just	 the	 meaning	 of	 “of”.	 Η	 αρχή	 της	 άνοιξης	 –	
    the	 beginning	 of	 spring.	 We	 are	 waiting	 for	 the	 beginning	 of	 spring.	 We	 are	
    awaiting	the	beginning	of	spring.		
	
S:	 Περιμένουμε	την	αρχή	της	άνοιξης	[periménume	tin	archí	tis	ániksis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Περιμένουμε	την	αρχή	της	άνοιξης.		
	
	 The	word	for	“seven”	was,	εφτά	[eftá].	And	the	word	for	“week”	...	?		


                                                                                              438
	
S:	 Εβδομάδα	[efdhomádha].		
	
T:	 Εβδομάδα	[evdhomádha],	with	a	V	[v]	sound;	unlike	“εφτά”	[eftá],	which	has	an	F	
    [f].	 Εβδομάδα	 [evdhomádha].	 Every	 day	 of	 the	 week.	 All	 the	 days	 of	 the	 week.	
    How	would	that	be?	All	the	days	of	the	week.		
	
S:	 ‘Ολες	οι	μέρες	της	εβδομάδας	[óles	i	méres	tis	evdhomádhas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	‘Ολες	οι	μέρες	της	εβδομάδας.	So	we	have,	εβδομάδα,	η	εβδομάδα	–	
    “the	week”;	της	εβδομάδας	–	“of	the	week”.		
	
	 You	remember	how	was,	the	life?	Like	in	“zoo”,	like	in	the	English	name,	“Zoe”?		
	
S:	 Η	ζωή	[i	zoí].		
	
T:	 Η	ζωή.	All	the	days	of	my	life.		
	
S:	 ‘Ολες	οι	μέρες	της	ζωής	μου	[óles	i	méres	tis	zoís	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	‘Ολες	οι	μέρες	της	ζωής	μου.	How	would	you	say,	We	have	something	for	
    every	day	of	the	week?	We	have	something	for	every	day	of	the	week.		
	
S:	 ‘Εχουμε	κάτι	για	όλες	τις	μέρες	της	εβδομάδας	[ékhume	káti	ya	óles	tis	méres	tis	
    evdhomádhas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	‘Εχουμε	κάτι	για	όλες	τις	μέρες	της	εβδομάδας.	So	here,	όλες	τις	μέρες	
    [óles	tis	méres],	uses	“τις”	[tis]	not	“οι”	[i],	because	it’s,	“for	all	the	days”	–	which	
    means	it’s	“for	them”,	rather	than	“for	they”,	so	“για	όλες	τις	μέρες”	[ya	óles	tis	
    méres].	And	then	a	different	[tis]	(της)	–	της	εβδομάδας	–	“of	the	week”.		
	




                                                                                         439

Teacher:	So	we	can	extend	this	idea	of	possession	like	in,	το	σπίτι	του	[to	spíti	 tu],	
    with	other	nouns,	like	in,	το	σπίτι	του	Γιώργου	[to	spíti	tu	yórghu],	or,	το	σπίτι	του	
    Μίχαλη	[to	spíti	tu	mikháli].	And	we’ve	seen	that	with	the	feminine	as	well,	using	
    της	 [tis]	 and	 an	 S	 (-ς)	 on	 the	 end	 of	 the	 noun:	 το	 σπίτι	 της	 Μαρίας	 [to	 spíti	 tis	
    marías],	 το	 σπίτι	 της	 φίλης	 μου	 [to	 spíti	 tis	 fílis	 mu],	 οι	 μέρες	 της	 εβδομάδας	 [i	
    méres	tis	evdhomádhas]	–	“the	days	of	the	week”.		
	
	 We	can	also	do	something	similar	with	the	neuter	singular.	What	was,	the	child?		
	
Student:	Το	παιδί	[to	pedhí].		
	
T:	 Το	παιδί.	Do	you	remember	how	to	say,	teacher?		
	
S:	 Δάσκαλος	[dháskalos].		
	
T:	 Δάσκαλος.	How	would	you	say,	The	child	of	the	teacher?	The	teacher’s	child.		
	
S:	 Το	παιδί	του	δασκάλου	[to	pedhí	tu	dhaskálu].		
	
T:	 	Very	 good.	 Το	 παιδί	 του	 δασκάλου.	 So	 there	 we	 move	 the	 accent.	 We	 have,	
    δάσκαλος	[dháskalos],	and	then	δασκάλου	[dhaskálu].	So	we	saw	how	this	occurs	
    when	we	add	“-ου”	[u]	to	longer	nouns,	but	not	just	with	longer	nouns.	We	notice	
    that	the	original	accent	is	third	from	the	end	on,	δάσκαλος.	So	when	we	have	that	
    situation,	that	“-ου”	can	pull	the	accent	towards	it:	του	δασκάλου.	Το	παιδί	του	
    δασκάλου.		
	
	 And	we	also	had,	δασκάλα	[dhaskála],	δασκάλα	–	for	the	feminine.	So	how	would	
    you	say,	The	child	of	the	female	teacher?		
	
S:	 Το	παιδί	της	δασκάλας	[to	pedhí	tis	dhaskálas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	παιδί	της	δασκάλας.		
	
	 Του	 παιδιού	 [tu	 pedhiú]	 means	 “of	 the	 child”.	 So	 we	 have,	 το	 παιδί,	 which	 is	
    neuter,	and	then,	του	παιδιού	–	“of	the	child”.		
	
S:	 Του	παιδού.		
	
T:	 What	do	you	notice	about	the	accent	here?		
	
S:	 The	“ου”	[u]	is	stressed,	not	the	“ι”	[i].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	actually,	in	both	cases,	we	have	the	accent	on	the	end	–	just	it	moves.	Το	
    παιδί	 –	 του	 παιδιού	 [to	 pedhí,	 tu	 pedhiú].	 “The	 toy”,	 the	 toy,	 is	 παιχνίδι	
    [pekhnídhi].		


                                                                                                  440
	
S:	 Παιχνίδι.		
	
T:	 And	that’s	neuter.	Το	παιχνίδι	[to	pekhnídhi].	Το	παιχνίδι.		
	
	S:	Το	παιχνίδι.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	The	child’s	toy	(The	toy	of	the	child)?		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	του	παιδιού	[to	pekhnídhi	tu	pedhiú].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	παιχνίδι	του	παιδιού.	How	would	you	say,	My	child’s	toy?	My	child’s	toy.		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	του	παιδιού	μου	[to	pekhnídhi	tu	pedhiú	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	παιχνίδι	του	παιδιού	μου.	How	do	you	think,	Of	the	toy,	might	be?		
	
S:	 Του	παιχνιδιού	[tu	pekhnidhiú].		
	
T:	 Yes.	It	also	takes	the	accent	on	the	end	there.	Του	παιχνιδιού	[tu	pekhnidhiú],	του	
    παιχνιδιού.	 So	 we	 have,	 παιχνίδι	 [pekhnídhi],	 with	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 [í]	 (ί),	
    παιχνίδι;	 and	 then,	 του	 παιχνιδιού	 [tu	 pekhnidhiú].	 So	 maybe	 you	 could	 say	
    something	like,	This	is	from	your	child’s	toy.	Maybe	you	find	a	piece	of	something,	
    and	you	say,	This	is	from	your	child’s	toy.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Αυτό	είναι	του	παιχνιδιού	του	παιδιού	σου	[aftó	íne	tu	pekhnidhiú	tu	pedhiú	su].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.	So	“this”,	you	used	the	neuter	because,	you	know,	this,	a	
    piece	of	something	we	will	find,	we	will	say	“αυτό”.	Αυτό	είναι	του	παιχνιδιού	του	
    παιδιού	σου.	Αυτό	είναι	του	παιχνιδιού	του	παιδιού	σου.	
	
	 But	you	can	feel	that’s	kind	of	complicated,	no?	So,	we	might	also	just	say,	This	is	
    from	 the	 toy,	 actually	 using	 the	 word	 for	 “from”:	 Aυτό	 είναι	 άπ’	 το	 (or,	 από	 το)	
    παιχνίδι	[aftó	íne	ap’to	(apó	to)	pekhnídhi].	We	will	probably	do	that,	just	because	
    it	requires	much	less	glucose,	you	know.	Αυτό	είναι	από	το	παιχνίδι	του	παιδιού	
    σου	[aftó	íne	apó	to	pekhnídhi	tu	pedhiú	su].	But	you	have	the	option	of	course.		
	
	 How	was,	the	book?	Do	you	remember,	the	book?		
	
S:	 Το	βιβλίο	[to	vivlío].		
	
T:	 Το	βιβλίο.	Of	the	book,	might	be?		
	
S:	 Του	βιβλιού	[tu	vivliú].		
	
T:	 That’s	what	you	will	think,	no,	going	from,	το	παιδί	[to	pedhí]	to,	του	παιδιού	[tu	
    pedhiú];	παιχνίδι,	παιχνιδιού	[pekhnídhi,	pekhnidhiú];	but	no.	Το	βιβλίο	[to	vivlío]	


                                                                                              441
   becomes	του	βιβλίου	[tu	vivlíu].	So	we	don’t	have	the	accent	on	the	“-ου”	[u],	but	
   just	 before.	 So	 there’s	 a	 slightly	 different	 pattern	 here,	 no?	 You	 have,	 το	 παιδί,	
   but	then,	το	βιβλίο;	they	have	the	accent	in	the	same	place,	but	βιβλίο	[vivlío]	has	
   an	O	[o].	So	when	you	notice	differences	like	this,	just	try	to	look	around.	See	if	
   you	 can	 find	 a	 pattern;	 see	 if	 you	 can	 identify	 one.	 And	 don’t	 worry	 about	
   memorising	these	things,	because	the	fact	that	you’re	thinking	about	it,	just	trying	
   to	 find	 a	 pattern	 –	 this	 is	 what’s	 going	 to	 work	 your	 memory,	 not	 the	 act	 of	
   memorising.	 And	 when	 you	 start	 using	 Greek,	 and	 you	 hear	 “του	 βιβλίου”	 [tu	
   vivlíu],	and	you	don’t	hear	“του	βιβλιού”	[tu	vivliú],	there’s	only	a	couple	of	times	
   you	can	say	it	without	it	sounding	weird	to	you,	and	setting	the	alarm	off.	So	here	
   we	have,	του	βιβλίου	[tu	vivlíu]	–	“of	the	book”.		
	
	 You	could	say,	“the	theme	of	the	book”.	Theme	is	the	same	word	in	Greek,	and	it	
    ends	 MA	 (μα)	 [ma],	 like	 one	 of	 those	 MA	 words,	 like,	 πρόβλημα	 [próvlima].	 So	
    how	might	that	be,	The	theme	of	the	book?		
	
S:	 Το	θέμα	του	βιβλίου	[to	théma	tu	vivlíu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	θέμα	[to	théma].	“Το”	[to],	because	it	ends	MA	(μα),	like,	το	χρώμα,	
    το	πρόβλημα	[to	khróma,	to	próvlima].	Το	θέμα	του	βιβλίου	–	the	theme	of	the	
    book.	 So	 accent	 can	 be	 very	 particular	 in	 Greek.	 And	 if	 you	 really	 want	 a	 native	
    feel	to	your	Greek,	it’s	something	you	have	to	pay	special	attention	to.		
	
	 So	 these	 are	 the	 main	 patterns,	 no,	 to	 achieve	 this	 “of”	 meaning:	 το	 σπίτι	 του	
    Γιώργου	[to	spíti	tu	yórghu];	το	σπίτι	της	Μαρίας	[to	spíti	tis	marías];	το	σπίτι	του	
    παιδιού	 [to	 spíti	 tu	 pedhiú].	 But	 you	 may	 find	 other	 pattern	 too.	 Like,	 “Of	 the	
    problem”,	 for	 example,	 is,	 του	 προβλήματος	 [tu	 provlímatos];	 and	 “Of	 the	
    course”,	 not	 “of	 course”,	 no,	 “of	 the	 course”	 –	 so,	 το	 μάθημα	 [to	 máthima]	
    becomes,	του	μαθήματος	[tu	mathímatos].	So	as	I	said,	you	should	listen	out	and	
    try	to	make	your	own	patterns	–	find	what	things	have	in	common.	So,	what	does,	
    πρόβλημα	[próvlima]	and,	μάθημα	[máthima]	have	in	common?		
	
S:	 Three	syllables;	the	first	is	stressed.		
	
T:	 That’s	true.	But	we’ve	also	seen	many	other	words	that	have	that,	that	don’t	do	
    this;	and	there’s	something	much	more	obvious	that	makes	these	...		
	
S:	 They	also	have	the	[ma]	(μα).		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 we	 go,	 “Ooh!	 Did	 I	 find	 a	 pattern?”	 We	 have,	 του	 προβλήματος	 [tu	
    provlímatos];	 we	 have,	 του	 μαθήαμτος	 [tu	 mathímatos].	 Maybe	 I’ve	 found	 a	
    pattern.	So	I	want	to	find	another	[ma]	(μα)	word	to	check	it.	So	can	you	think	of	
    another	[ma]	(μα)	word?		
	
S:	 Πρόγραμμα	[próghrama].		
	



                                                                                               442
T:	 Πρόγραμμα.	Then	we	can	check,	you	know.	How	do	we	say,	Of	the	program?	And	
    if	 it’s,	 του	 προγάμματος	 [tu	 proghrámatos],	 which	 it	 is,	 then	 we’ve	 found	 a	
    pattern.	We	have,	το	χρώμα	[to	khróma]	–	“the	colour”.	So,	Of	the	colour,	might	
    be?		
	
S:	 Του	χρώματος	[tu	khrómatos].		
	
T:	 Του	χρώματος.	Good,	it	is.	Του	χρώματος.		
	
	 So	 we	 had,	 δάσκαλος	 [dháskalos]	 or,	 δασκάλα	 [dhaskála],	 for	 a	 teacher.	 How	
    would	we	say,	The	children	of	the	teacher?	And	we	mean	a	female	teacher.		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	της	δασκάλας	[ta	pedhiá	tis	dhaskálas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τα	παιδιά	της	δασκάλας.	And	how	would	you	say,	The	children	of	this	
    teacher?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	της	δασκάλας	αυτής	[ta	pedhiá	tis	dhaskálas	aftís]?		
	
T:	 Οkay.	 But	 you	 know	 the	 general	 position	 that	 that	 goes	 in,	 when	 you	 say,	 “this	
    teacher”,	for	example.	So	there’s	no	reason	to	change	that	when	you’re	working	
    through	 –	 I	 mean	 to	 change	 the	 order.	 So	 how	 do	 you	 say,	 This	 teacher?	 This	
    teacher.		
	
S:	 Αυτή	η	δασκάλα	[aftí	i	dhaskála].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	 η	 δασκάλα.	 So	 that	 can	 get	 all	 muddled	 around	 when	 you’re	 working	 out	
    what’s	doing	what	in	your	mind.	But	the	order	is	going	to	stay	the	same.		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	αυτής	της	δασκάλας	[ta	pedhiá	aftís	tis	dhaskálas].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Τα	 παιδιά	 αυτής	 της	 δασκάλας.	 Very	 good.	 And,	 The	 children	 of	 that	
    (female)	teacher?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	εκείνης	της	δασκάλας	[ta	pedhiá	ekínis	tis	dhaskálas].		
	
T:	 Τα	παιδιά	εκείνης	της	δασκάλας.	Γυναίκα	[yinéka]	was	“woman”.	Γυναίκα.		
	
S:	 Γυναίκα.		
	
T:	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 The	 child	 of	 this	 woman	 is	 so	 good?	 So,	 The	 child	 of	 this	
    woman?		
	
S:	 Το	παιδί	αυτής	της	γυναίκας	[to	pedhí	aftís	tis	yinékas].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	παιδί	αυτής	της	γυναίκας	…	is	so	good.	For	“so”,	we	can	use,	τόσο	
    [tóso].	Tόσο.		


                                                                                            443
	
S:	 Τόσο.		
	
T:	 Is	so	good.		
	
S:	 Eίναι	τόσο	καλό	[íne	tóso	kaló].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	παιδί	αυτής	της	γυναίκας	είναι	τόσο	καλό	[to	pedhí	aftís	tis	yinékas	íne	
    tóso	kaló].		
	
	 The	 word	 for	 like,	 “amazing”	 or	 “wonderful”,	 is	 καταπληκτικό	 [katapliktikó].	
    Kαταπληκτικό,	which	is	fun	to	say.	Καταπληκτικό.		
	
S:	 Καταπληκτικό.		
	
T:	 Good.	So	imagine	you	come	across	this	word,	what’s	the	first	thing	you	do	when	
    you	look	at	it,	if	it’s	a	new	word?		
	
S:	 You	can	break	it	up?		
	
T:	 You	have	a	look	if	you	see	...	?		
	
S:	 You	can	see	parts	that	you	recognise.		
	
T:	 Okay.		
	
S:	 The	…	the	beginning,	it’s	a	bit	like,	κάτο	[káto].		
	
T:	 Exactly.	 Κατα	 [kata],	 and	 “κάτο”	 becomes	 “κατα”	 many	 times	 when	 it’s	 creating	
    vocabulary,	like	in,	καταλαβαίνω	[katalavéno],	κατάλογος	[katáloghos].	So	we	just	
    notice	 that,	 and	 then	 the	 only	 thing	 that’s	 new	 is,	 πληκτικό	 [pliktikó],	 not	
    καταπληκτικό.	So	how	would	you	say,	The	toy	of	this	child	is	amazing?		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	αυτό	του	παιδιού	είναι	καταπληκτικό	[to	pekhnídhi	aftó	tu	pedhiú	íne	
    katapliktikó].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	“αυτό	του	παιδιού”	[aftó	tu	pedhiú]?		
	
S:	 Aυτού	 του	 παιδιού	 [aftú	 tu	 pedhiú].	 Το	 παιχνίδι	 αυτού	 του	 παιδιού	 είναι	
    καταπληκτικό	[to	pekhnídhi	aftú	tu	pedhiú	íne	katapliktikó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Το	παιχνίδι	αυτού	του	παιδιού	είναι	καταπληκτικό.	Good.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	go,	or,	I’m	going?		
	
Student:	Πáω	[páo]	or,	πηγαíνω	[piyéno].		
	
T:	 	Good;	πηγαíνω,	or,	πάω.	And	we	saw,	πηγαίνουμε	[piyénume],	no,	for,	we	go	(or,	
    we’re	going).	Or,	instead	of,	πηγαίνουμε,	we	could	have?		
	
S:	 Πηγαίναμε	[piyéname]	or,	πάμε	[páme].		
	
T:	 Just,	πάμε	[páme].	No?	So	this	isn’t	like	an	...		
	
S:	 Oh	no!	Yes.		
	
T:	 This	isn’t	like,	μιλάω	[miláo],	you	know,	that	can	have	alternative	forms;	this	is	a	
    just	a	very	strange	contraction.	Πηγαίνω	–	πάω	[piyéno,	páo];	πηγαίνουμε	–	πάμε	
    [piyénume,	 páme].	 And,	 “Πάμε!”,	 we	 said,	 can	 also	 be	 used	 like,	 “Let’s	 go!”.	 So,	
    how	would	you	say,	Let’s	go	to	my	friend’s	house,	and	we	mean	a	female	friend.		
	
S:	 Πάμε	στο	σπίτι	της	φίλης	μου	[páme	sto	spíti	tis	fílis	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πάμε.	Πάμε	στο	σπίτι	της	φίλης	μου.	How	would	you	say,	We’re	going,	
    emphasising	the	word	for	“we”?		
	
S:	 Εμείς	πάμε	[emís	páme].		
	
T:	 Εμείς	πάμε.	You	go,	the	informal,	we	could	have,	πηγαίνεις	[piyénis],	or	...	?		
	
S:	 Πας	[pas].		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	Where	will	you	go?	–	emphasising	the	word	for	“you”?	Where	
    will	you	go?		
	
S:	 Εσύ	πού	θα	πας;	[esí	pu	tha	pas?].		
	
T:	 So	 here	 we	 would	 have	 to	 use	 “πας”.	 No?	 “Where	 will	 you	 go”,	 rather	 than	
    “where	 will	 you	 be	 going”.	 We	 use	 the	 closed	 version,	 which	 is	 also	 this	
    abbreviated	form,	πας.	Εσύ	πού	θα	πας;	Πού	θα	πας	εσύ;	[pu	tha	pas	esí?].	He	(or	
    she)	goes	–	we	could	have,	πηγαίνει	[piyéni],	or	...	?		
	
	S:	Πάει	[pái].		
	
T:	 Πάει.	How	would	you	say,	He	is	going	now	–	emphasising	the	word	for	“he”?		
	
S:	 Αυτός	πάει	τώρα	[aftós	pái	tóra].		
	


                                                                                             445
T:	 Αυτός	πάει	τώρα.	So	we	can	say	words	like,	εμείς,	αυτός,	εγώ,	εσύ	[emís,	aftós,	
    eghó,	esí],	etc.,	no,	to	emphasise	“we,	he,	I,	…	”.	How	would	you	say,	Does	she	see	
    me?	–	emphasising	the	word	for	“she”.	Does	she	see	me?		
	
S:	 Αυτή	μου	βλέπει;	[aftí	mu	vlépi?].		
	
T:	 Mου	βλέπει	[mu	vlépi]?		
	
S:	 Mε	βλέπει.	Αυτή	με	βλέπει;	[aftí	mu	vlépi?].		
	
T:	 Αυτή	με	βλέπει;	So	this	emphasises	“αυτή”.	Βut	what	if	we	wanted	to	emphasise	
    “me”?	 For	 emphasising	 “me”,	 we	 have	 a	 longer	 version	 of,	 με	 [me],	 and	 this	 is,	
    εμένα	[eména].	Eμένα.		
	
S:	 Εμένα.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	Does	she	see	me?	–	emphasising	the	word	for	“me”.		
	
S:	 Εμένα	βλέπει;	[eména	vlépi?].		
	
T:	 Εμένα	βλέπει;	Βλέπει	εμένα;	[vlépi	eména?].		
	
	 So	 actually,	 εμένα	 [eména]	 is	 flexible	 in	 its	 order.	 You	 can	 say,	 Bλέπει	 εμένα,	
    Eμένα	βλέπει.	And	also	we	could	repeat	the	“με”.	So,	Mε	βλέπει	εμένα,	Eμένα	με	
    βλέπει.	And	whether	you	will	repeat	the	“με”	or	not,	might	depend	on	the	verb	
    that	you	are	using,	and	what	order	is	preferred.	Whether	you	put	“εμένα”	before	
    or	after	can	depend	on	the	verb,	on	the	dialect,	on	the	situation,	and	how	much	
    you’re	wanting	to	stress.	So	again	this	is	something	you	want	to	listen	out	to	live,	
    to	really	fine-tune	your	hearing	to	how	these	are	used.	
	
	 So	“με”	becomes	“εμένα”	to	emphasise	it.	So	if	we	go	from	“με”	to	“εμένα”,	“σε”	
    might	be	…	?		
	
S:	 Εσένα	[eséna].		
	
T:	 Εσένα.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	“I	see	you”,	but	you	are	emphasising	this	“you”.	So,	
    of	course	you	would	need	a	context	to	be	emphasising	it.	So,	I	see	you,	not	him,	
    for	example.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Εσένα	βλέπω	[eséna	vlépo].		
	
T:	 Εσένα	βλέπω.	Βλέπω	εσένα	[vlépo	eséna].	Or,	Σε	βλέπω	εσένα	[se	vlépo	eséna].	
    Eσένα	σε	βλέπω	[eséna	se	vlépo].		
	
	 If	you	want	to	use	the	emphatic	word	for,	τνη	[tin],	or	for,	τον	[ton],	well	that’s	
    just,	αυτήν	[aftín]	and,	αυτόν	[aftón].	So,	I	see	her,	emphasising	“her”?		
	


                                                                                            446
S:	 Αυτήν	βλέπω	[aftín	vlépo].		
	
T:	 Αυτήν	 βλέπω.	 Βλέπω	 αυτήν	 [vlépo	 aftín].	 Or,	 if	 we	 repeat	 the	 “την”:	 Aυτήν	 την	
    βλέπω	 [aftín	 tin	 vlépo].	 Tην	 βλέπω	 αυτήν	 [tin	 vlépo	 aftín].	 And	 of	 course	 this	
    could	mean:	“I	see	her”,	emphatically,	no;	or	“I	see	it”	–	a	feminine	thing;	or	“I	see	
    this”.	No?	We	know	that,	αυτή	–	αυτήν	[aftí,	aftín]	also	means	“this”.	And	if	we	
    think	about	it,	“this”	is	just	an	emphatic	word	for	“it”.	I	see	it;	I	see	this.	This	“it”	
    makes	it	a	little	more	emphatic.	So	the	relationship	between	“την”	and	“αυτήν”	is	
    the	same	as	that	between	“το”	[to]	and	“αυτό”	[aftó].		
	
	 How	…	how	is,	I	like,	or,	I	like	it?		
	
S:	 Μου	αρέσει	[mu	arési].		
	
T:	 Μου	αρέσει.	It	is	pleasing	to	me.	Μου	αρέσει.	If	you	want	to	say	“I	like	it”,	and	
    stress	the	“I”,	well	we	need	to	think	about	what	we’re	saying	in	Greek,	no?	It	is	
    pleasing	to	me.	To	me	it	is	pleasing.	So	this	is	“to	me”,	so	we	would	probably	still	
    include	the	“μου”	[mu],	when	we	put	“εμένα”	[eména],	so	that	we	can	still	show	
    that	the	meaning	is,	“to	me”.	So	how	would	that	be?	I	like	it.		
	
S:	 Εμένα	μου	αρέσει	[eména	mu	arési].		
	
T:	 Εμένα	 μου	 αρέσει.	 Μου	 αρέσει	 εμένα	 [mu	 arési	 eména].	 Μ’	 αρέσει	 εμένα	
    [m’arési	eména].		
	
	 We	have,	μιλάω	[miláo],	no	–	“I	speak”.	Mιλάω.	I’m	speaking	to	you.	I’m	speaking	
    to	you.	
	
S:	 Σου	μιλάω	[su	miláo].		
	
T:	 Σου	 μιλάω.	 So	 because	 we	 have	 “σου”	 [su]	 here,	 if	 we	 want	 to	 stress,	 I	 am	
    speaking	to	you,	you	will	keep	the	“σου”	but	you	will	also	put	the	“εσένα”.		
	
S:	 Εσένα	σου	μιλάω	[eséna	su	miláo].		
	
T:	 Εσένα	 σου	 μιλάω.	 Σου	 μιλάω	 εσένα	 [su	 miláo	 eséna].	 And	 other	 than	 including	
    this	σου	[su]	with	the	‘σένα	[séna]	–	εσένα	σου	μιλάω	–	we	could	also	say,	to	you,	
    σε	εσένα	[se	eséna],	which	becomes,	σ’	εσένα	[s’eséna].	And	there	we	would	have	
    the	meaning	of	“to”	with	σε,	no	–	“the	self	to”,	like	in,	στο	[sto],	no;	“to	the”.	So,	
    σ’	εσένα	[s’eséna];	σ’	εσένα	μιλάω	[s’eséna	miláo]	–	I’m	talking	to	you.		
	
	 What	is,	I	give?		
	
S:	 Δίνω	[dhíno].		
	
T:	 Δίνω.	And	the	closed	form?		
	


                                                                                           447
S:	 Δώσω	[dhóso].		
	
T:	 Δώσω.	He	gave?		
	
S:	 ‘Εδωσε	[édhose].		
	
T:	 ‘Εδωσε.	He	didn’t	give	it	to	me.	He	didn’t	give	it	to	me.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	το	έδωσε	[dhen	mu	to	édhose].		
	
T:	 Δεν	μου	το	έδωσε.	And	if	you	want	to	stress	“to	me”	–	He	didn’t	give	it	to	me,	how	
    would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Εμένα	δεν	μου	το	έδωσε	[eména	dhen	mu	to	édhose].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Εμένα	 δεν	 μου	 το	 έδωσε.	 Δεν	 μου	 το	 έδωσε	 εμένα	 [dhen	 mu	 to	 édhose	
    eména].	So	because	“εμένα”	doesn’t	include	the	information	of,	“to	me”	–	it	just	
    shows	“me”,	emphatic	–	if	we	have	a	“μου”,	we	keep	it.	Εμένα	δεν	μου	το	έδωσε.	
    And	the	same	with	“σου”,	no.	We	could	have,	σου	αρέσει	[su	arési],	and	then	if	
    we	 want	 to	 emphasise	 that:	 Eσένα	 σου	 αρέσει	 [eséna	 su	 arési],	 keeping	 that	
    “σου”.	But	as	we	saw,	we	can	also	play	around	with	the	wording	a	little	bit,	and	
    say	 “to”.	 You	 could	 say,	 for	 example,	 He	 didn’t	 give	 it	 to	 me;	 you	 could	 say,	
    σ’	εμένα	 [s’eména]	 –	 “to	 me”.	 And	 then	 you	 don’t	 have	 to	 repeat	 the	 “μου”,	
    because	 you’ve	 already	 included	 that	 information.	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be?	 He	
    didn’t	give	it	to	me	–	this	time	using	our	word	for	“to”?		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	έδωσε	σε	εμένα	[dhen	to	édhose	se	eména].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 το	 έδωσε	 σ’	 εμένα	 [dhen	 to	 édhose	 s’eména].	 So,	 σε	 εμένα	 [se	
    eména]	contracts	to,	σ’	εμένα	[s’eména],	σ’	εμένα;	you	don’t	hear	two	E’s	(ε).	You	
    don’t	write	them	either;	you	have	an	apostrophe	there.	Δεν	το	έδωσε	σ’	εμένα.		
	
	                                 	




                                                                                            448
Complete Greek, Track 93 – Language Transfer
	
Teacher:	So	we	saw,	με	[me]	and	εμένα	[eména],	σε	[se]	and	εσένα	[eséna],	αυτήν	
    [aftín]	instead	of,	την	[tin],	and	we’ve	just	seen,	σ’	εμένα	[s’eména]	–	“to	me”.	So	
    “σε”	 [se]	 is	 one	 of	 those	 small	 words	 that	 show	 position	 or	 movement,	 that	 are	
    called	 prepositions,	 like,	 σε,	 για	 [ya],	 από	 [apó]	 (from,	 or	 of).	 And	 all	 of	 these	
    words,	when	you	say,	for	example,	“for	me”,	you	will	not	say,	για	με	[ya	me];	you	
    will	 say,	 για	 ’μένα	 [ya’ména].	 So	 all	 of	 these	 words,	 these	 prepositions,	 take	
    “εμένα”	rather	than	“με”,	when	they	mean	“for	me”,	“from	me”;	“εσένα”	rather	
    than	“σε”.		
	
	 But	 we	 also	 notice	 that	 they	 blend	 together	 the	 vowels	 of	 the	 preposition	 and	
    εμένα,	or	εσένα,	etc.	So	we	get	“σ’	εμένα”	[s’eména],	“σ’	εσένα”	[s’eséna],	“από	
    ’μένα”	[apó	’ména],	“από	’σένα”	[apó	’séna].	And	the	use	of,	εμένα,	εσένα,	etc.,	
    here,	 isn’t	 emphatic	 anymore;	 this	 is	 just	 what	 we	 do	 after	 a	 preposition.	 We	
    don’t	say	“για	με”,	but	“για	’μένα”.		
	
Student:	Για	’μένα	[ya	’ména].		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	from	me?		
	
S:	 Από	εμένα	[apó	eména].		
	
T:	 Good.	And	again	the	[e]	(ε)	gets	swallowed	up	because	these	prepositions	end	in	
    vowels.	So,	για	’μένα	[ya	’ména],	από	’μένα	[apó	’ména].	How	about,	with	me?		
	
S:	 Με	’μένα	[me	’ména].		
	
T:	 Με	’μένα.	Otherwise	it	would	be,	με	με	[me	me],	no?	Με	’μένα.	With	you?		
	
S:	 Με	’σένα	[me	’séna].		
	
T:	 Με	’σένα.	To	you?		
	
S:	 Σε	’σένα	[se	’séna].		
	
T:	 Σε	‘σένα.	Otherwise	this	would	also	be,	σε	σε	[se	se],	no?	Σε	’σένα.	So	the	fact	that	
    we	have	“to	you”	–	σε	’σένα,	and	not,	σε	σε,	and,	με	’μένα	–	“with	me”,	and	not,	
    με	 με	 [me	 me],	 is	 a	 nice	 hook	 to	 remember:	 that	 with	 prepositions,	 these	 little	
    words	 that	 show	 position	 or	 movement	 –	 after	 these,	 if	 we	 want	 to	 say,	 for	
    example,	 “to	 me”,	 “for	 me”,	 “from	 me”,	 we	 use:	 ’μένα	 [’ména]	 rather	 than	 με	
    [me];	’σένα	[’séna]	rather	than,	σε	[se];	αυτόν	[aftón]	rather	than	τον	[ton].		
	
	 How	would	you	say,	Don’t	you	like	it?		
	
S:	 Δεν	σου	αρέσει;	[dhen	su	arési?].		
	


                                                                                               449
T:	 Δεν	σου	αρέσει;	And	what	if	you	wanted	to	stress	the	“you”,	you	know.	Don’t	you	
    like	it?		
	
S:	 Εσένα	δεν	σου	αρέσει;	[eséna	dhen	su	arési?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Εσένα	 δεν	 σου	 αρέσει;	 No?	 So	 as	 “εσένα”	 doesn’t	 give	 us	 the	
    information	of	“to	you”,	we	include	that	“σου”.	Εσένα	δεν	σου	αρέσει;		
	
	 But	 we	 could	 also	 say	 “σε	 ’σένα”	 [se	 ’séna].	 We	 could	 include	 the	 information	
    there.	So	how	would	you	say	that?	Don’t	you	like	it?	–	still	emphatic,	but	with,	σε	
    ’σένα.	How	would	that	be?	Don’t	you	like	it?		
	
S:	 Σε	’σένα	δεν	αρέσει;	[se	’séna	dhen	arési?].		
	
T:	 Σε	’σένα	δεν	αρέσει.	Νο?	So	there	we	don’t	include	the	“σου”,	because	we	have	
    all	of	the	information	that	we	need	to	express	in,	“σε	’σένα”.	Σε	’σένα	δεν	αρέσει;	
    Δεν	αρέσει	σε	’σένα;	[dhen	arési	se	’séna?].

S:	 Είναι	από	’μένα	[íne	apó	’ména].		
	
T:	 Είναι	από	’μένα.	Good.	So	this	is,	από	εμένα	[apó	eména],	but	that	contracts,	no?	
    Eίναι	από	’μένα.	Is	it	from	you?		
	
S:	 Είναι	από	’σένα;	[íne	apó	’séna?].		
	
T:	 Είναι	από	’σένα;	So	we	have,	βλέπω	[vlépo],	no,	for	“I	see”,	and	the	closed	version

    not	someone	else?		
	
S:	 Αυτούς	τους	είδα	[aftús	tus	ídha].		
	
T:	 Yeah,	that	could	work	in	some	context.	As	we’ve	seen,	depending	on	the	context	
    and	what	exactly	we	want	to	stress,	we	may	repeat	the	information	of	“αυτούς”	
    with	“τους”.	We	may	put	it	in	a	different	order.	This	may	also	change,	depending	
    on	the	dialect.	So	this	is	definitely	something	we	want	to	listen	out	for,	on	the	go.	
    No?	We	could	have,	αυτούς	τους	είδα	[aftús	tus	ídha],	τους	είδα	αυτούς	[tus	ídha

T:	 Μας	 είδατε;	 We	 have	 a	 small	 change	 for	 “μας”	 in	 the	 emphatic;	 we	 get	 “εμάς”	
    [emás].	Eμάς.		
	
S:	 Εμάς.		
	
T:	 So	just	“μας”,	with	an	E	(ε).	So	what	if	you	wanted	to	stress?	Did	you	see	us?		


                                                                                         451
	
S:	 Είδατε	εμάς;	[ídhate	emás?]	.	
	
T:	 Good.	Είδατε	εμάς;	And	the	same	with	“σας”	[sas],	no?	We	would	have	“σας”	and	
    “εσάς”	[esás].	So,	if	you	wanted	to	say	“I	saw	you	guys”,	and	we’re	emphasising	
    “you	guys”,	how	would	that	be?	I	saw	you	guys.		
	
S:	 Είδα	εσάς	[ídha	esás].		
	
T:	 So	just	to	say,	“I	saw	you	guys”	–	σας	είδα	[sas	ídha].	But	to	stress	that,	είδα	εσάς,	
    εσάς	σας	είδα	[esás	sas	ídha],	σας	είδα	εσάς	[sas	ídha	esás].	I	didn’t	see	you	guys.	
    No	emphasis,	just,	I	didn’t	see	you	guys.		
	
S:	 Δεν	σας	είδα	[dhen	sas	ídha].		
	
T:	 Δεν	σας	είδα.	And	what	if	we	wanted	to	emphasise?	I	didn’t	see	you	guys.		
	
S:	 Δεν	είδα	εσάς	[dhen	ídha	esás].		
	
T:	 Δεν	είδα	εσάς.	Very	good.		
	
	 How	was,	I	sell,	like	in	“monopoly”?		
	
S:	 Πουλάω	[puláo].		
	
T:	 Πουλάω.	How	would	you	say,	They	didn’t	sell	his	car	to	me?	They	didn’t	sell	his	car	
    to	me.	So	a	lot	to	think	about	there.	Let’s	begin	with,	They	didn’t	sell.	They	didn’t	
    sell.		
	
S:	 Δεν	πουλήσανε	[dhen	pulísane].	
	
T:	 Good.	Δεν	πούλησαν	[dhen	púlisan]	(or,	δεν	πουλήσανε).	Okay.	So	maybe	that’s	
    the	first	thought	we	have,	even	though	it’s	not	necessarily	the	first	thing	we	will	
    say.	 You	 know,	 we	 will	 think	 about	 the	 verb	 first	 and	 how	 to	 build	 it.	 So,	
    πούλησαν,	πουλήσανε	[púlisan,	pulísane].	They	didn’t	sell	his	car	to	me.	
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	πούλησαν	το	αυτοκίνητό	του	[dhen	mu	púlisan	to	aftokínitó	tu].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Δεν	 μου	 πούλησαν	 το	 αυτοκίνητό	 του.	 And	 if	 you	 want	 to	 be	 emphatic?	
    They	didn’t	sell	his	car	to	me.		
	
S:	 Εμένα	 δεν	 μου	 πούλησαν	 το	 αυτοκίνητό	 του	 [eména	 dhen	 mu	 púlisan	 to	
    aftokínitó	tu].		
	
T:	 Good.	Because	we	have	“μου”	[mu],	rather	than	“με”	[me],	we	don’t	get	rid	of	it	
    when	 we	 have	 “εμένα”	 [eména].	 Εμένα	 δεν	 μου	 πούλησαν	 το	 αυτοκίνητό	 του.	



                                                                                         452
   And	 of	 course	 we	 also	 have	 the	 accent	 doubled,	 no,	 from,	 το	 αυτοκίνητο	 [to	
   aftokínito],	and	then,	το	αυτοκίνητό	του	[to	aftokínitó	tu].		
	
	 And	we’ve	seen,	other	than	repeating	“μου”	and	having	“εμένα”,	no,	to	get	that	
  meaning	 of	 “to	 me”,	 in	 the	 emphatic,	 we	 can	 just	 say,	 σ’	 εμένα	 [s’eména]	 –	 “to	
  me”,	literally.	Σ’	εμένα	δεν	πούλησαν	το	αυτοκίνητό	του	[s’eména	dhen	púlisan	to	
  aftokínitó	 tu].	 Δεν	 πούλησαν	 το	 αυτοκίνητό	 του	 σ’	 εμένα	 [dhen	 púlisan	 to	
  aftokínitótu	s’eména].	Very	good.		
	
	                               	




                                                                                           453
Complete Greek, Track 94 – Language Transfer
	
Teacher:	We’ve	seen	various	ways	accents	might	move	around	in	Greek.	We	saw	that	
    it	might	happen	for	the	past,	no?	When	our	accent	isn’t	third	from	the	end	in	the	
    past,	we’ll	put	it	there.	We’ve	seen	how	with	longer	words	–	well,	longer	words	
    with	 their	 accents	 third	 from	 the	 end,	 their	 original	 accent	 like	 “αυτοκίνητο”	
    [aftokínito],	 like	 “δάσκαλος”	 [dháskalos],	 have	 some	 situations	 in	 which	 their	
    accent	can	move	or	double;	like	with	possessive	endings	like,	μου,	του,	σου,	etc.	
    Tο	αυτοκίνητο	–	το	αυτοκίνητό	σου	[to	aftokínito,	to	aftokínitó	su].	Or	when	we	
    change	the	ending	to	“-ου”	[u],	that	can	pull	the	accent	towards	it	as	well	in	these	
    words:	το	αυτοκίνητο	[to	aftokínito]	–	“the	car”,	του	αυτοκινήτου	[tu	aftokinítu]	–	
    “of	the	car”;	δάσκαλος	–	δασκάλου	[dháskalos,	dhaskálu].	We’ve	seen	the	plural	
    neuter	that	moves	the	accent,	but	again	only	in	longer	words	with	their	original	
    accent	 third	 from	 the	 end,	 like,	 πρόβλημα,	 προβλήματα	 [próvlima,	 provlímata].	
    And	 you	 will	 come	 across	 more	 examples	 of	 accents	 moving	 in	 Greek,	 and	 you	
    should	listen	out	for	them.	
	
	 An	 accent	 change,	 a	 change	 in	 stress	 in	 a	 word,	 can	 also	 completely	 change	 the	
    meaning	of	a	word.	So	apart	from	this	movement	of	accents	that	we’ve	seen	that	
    can	happen	for	grammatical	reasons,	often	the	difference	between	two	words	in	
    Greek	 is	 just	 the	 stress,	 if	 you	 go	 by	 sound.	 Often	 the	 words	 might	 be	 written	
    differently,	 but	 by	 sound	 you	 might	 only	 be	 able	 to	 differentiate	 them	 by	 the	
    stress.	
	
	 So,	for	example,	we	saw,	μόνος	[mónos],	which	means	“alone”	–	μόνος.	And	then,	
    μονός	 [monós]	 means	 like	 “a	 single”,	 like,	 “a	 single	 coffee”	 –	 ένας	 μονός	 καφές	
    [énas	monós	kafés];	or	also	“odd”,	like	an	odd	number.	So	you	might	see,	μονός,	
    and	think	that	the	accent	is	changing	for	some	grammatical	reason.	Or	you	might	
    hear	it,	and	think	that	the	accent	is	changing	for	some	grammatical	reason.	But	it’s	
    not;	it’s	just	a	different	word.	We	saw	the	word	for,	when,	which	was?		
	
Student:	Πότε	[póte].		
	
T:	 Πότε.	And	the	word	for	“never”	is,	ποτέ	[poté].		
	
S:	 Ποτέ.	
	
T:	 So	you	have,	πότε	–	“when”	and,	ποτέ	–	“never”.	How	would	you	say,	When	will	
    he	do	it?		
	
S:	 Πότε	θα	το	κάνει;	[póte	tha	to	káni?].		
	
T:	 Πότε	 θα	 το	 κάνει;	 He	 will	 never	 do	 it.	 In	 Greek	 we	 will	 say,	 He	 won’t	 do	 it	 ever	
    (never).		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	το	κάνει	ποτέ	[dhen	tha	to	káni	poté].		
	


                                                                                                 454
T:	 Δεν	θα	το	κάνει	ποτέ.		
	
	 We	saw	briefly	“πώς”,	which	means	“how”.	You	could	say,	How	are	you?		
	
S:	 Πώς	είσαι;	[pos	íse?].		
	
T:	 Πώς	είσαι;	And	there’s	a	small	change	to	“είσαι”,	no,	if	we	mean	more	than	one	
    “you”,	or	if	we’re	talking	formally.			
	
S:	 Πώς	είστε;	[pos	íste?].		
	
T:	 Πώς	είστε;	Πώς	είστε;	Do	you	know	how	she	is?		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	πώς	είναι;	[kséris	pos	íne?].		
	
T:	 Ξέρεις	πώς	είναι;	So	we	have,	πώς	[pos],	which	means	“how”,	and	we	have	πόσο	
    [póso],	which	means,	“how	much”.		
	
S:	 Πόσο.		
	
T:	 How	much	is	it?		
	
S:	 Πόσο	είναι;		
	
T:	 Πόσο	 είναι;	 You	 could	 also	 say,	 if	 you	 are	 asking	 about	 price,	 πόσο	 κάνει;	 [póso	
    káni?]	–	“How	much	does	it	do?	/	How	much	does	it	make?”	–	πόσο	κάνει;	Πόσο	
    κοστίζει;	–	of	course	–	“How	much	does	it	cost?”	Πόσο	κοστίζει;		
	
	 And	from,	πόσο	[póso]	–	“how	much”,	you	can	also	get	“how	many”,	if	you	make	
    it	plural.	So	what	would	be	the	plural	of,	πόσο?		
	
S:	 Πόσοι	[pósi].		
	
T:	 Well,	strictly	speaking,	if	“πόσο”	is	the	neuter,	what	would	be	...	?	
	
S:	 Πόσα	[pósa].		
	
T:	 Πόσα.	But	of	course,	πόσος,	πόσοι	[pósos,	pósi],	if	we	are	talking	about	masculine	
    things	–	πόσοι;	πόσα,	for	neuter	things.	For	feminine	things?		
	
S:	 Πόσες	[póses].		
	
T:	 Πόσες.		
	
	 Φορά	[forá]	means	“time”.	We’ve	already	seen	a	couple	of	words	for	“time”,	but	
    φορά	 means	 “time”	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 an	 occasion,	 no?	 Like	 “once”,	 “one	 time”	 –	
    φορά.		


                                                                                              455
	
S:	 Φορά.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	How	many	times?		
	
S:	 Πόσες	φορές;	[póses	forés?].		
	
T:	 Πόσες	φορές;	Πόσες	φορές;	How	many	times	do	I	have	to	tell	you?	So,	How	many	
    times	do	I	have	to	tell	you?		
	
S:	 Πόσες	φορές	πρέπει	να	σου	πω;	[póses	forés	prépi	na	su	po?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πόσες	φορές	πρέπει	να	σου	πω;	And	if	we	were	to	continue,	we	could	say	
    “what”,	or	maybe	we	would	want	to	say,	Πόσες	φορές	πρέπει	να	στο	πω;	[póses	
    forés	prépi	na	sto	po?]	(σου	το	πω	[su	to	po])	–	How	many	times	do	I	have	to	tell	
    you	it?		
	
	 The	word	for	“same”	is,	ίδιος	[ídhios].	Ίδιος.		
	
S:	 ‘Ιδιος.		
	
T:	 And	 that’s	 the	 masculine,	 no?	 Ίδιος.	 So	 we	 have,	 ίδιος	 –	 “same”,	 like	 in	
    idiosyncrasy.	No?	And	it	seems	that	“idiot”,	as	well,	is	related	to	this	word.	So	we	
    might	be	creative	and	say:	“An	idiot	is	the	one	that	does	the	same	thing	again	and	
    expects	different	results.”		If	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 “the	 same	 thing”,	 you	 don’t	 need	
    the	word	for	“thing”;	you	can	say,	το	ίδιο	[to	ídhio].	Use	“ίδιο”	in	the	neuter,	το	
    ίδιο,	and	it	means	“the	same	thing”.	So	how	would	you	say,	How	many	times	do	I	
    have	to	tell	you	the	same	thing?		
	
S:	 Πόσες	φορές	πρέπει	να	στο	πω	το	ίδιο;	[póses	forés	prépi	na	sto	po	to	ídhio?].		
	
T:	 Ooh!	The	“στο	πω”	[sto	po]	was	a	bit	automatic	there,	no?		
	
S:	 It	was	a	bit	risky.		
	
T:	 Because	then	you	are	kind	of	giving	the	information	twice,	no?	How	many	times	
    do	I	have	to	tell	you	it	–	the	same	thing?		
	
S:	 Yeah,	yeah.	I	noticed.		
	
T:	 Okay.	So	...	?		
	
S:	 Πόσες	φορές	πρέπει	να	σου	πω	το	ίδιο;	[póses	forés	prépi	na	su	po	to	ídhio?].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Πόσες	 φορές	 πρέπει	 να	 σου	 πω	 το	 ίδιο;	 Or,	 το	 ίδιο	 πράγμα	 [to	 ídhio	
    prághma],	 we	 could	 also	 have.	 Good.	 How	 many	 did	 you	 buy?	 And	 we	 mean	
    masculine	things.	How	many	did	you	buy?		


                                                                                           456
	
S:	 Πόσοι	αγοράσες;	[pósi	aghoráses?].		
	
T:	 So,	Πόσοι	αγόρασες	[pósi	aghórases]	would	be	like,	“you	bought	they”,	which	we	
    know	is	impossible.	You	can’t	buy	“they”,	but	you	can	buy	“them”.		
	
S:	 Πόσους	αγόρασες;	[pósus	aghórases?].		
	
T:	 Πόσους	αγόρασες.	Good.	So	we	have,	πόσο	[póso]	and	all	the	different	forms	of	
    πόσο,	no,	for	“how	much”,	or	“how	many”.	And	then	we	have,	ποσό	[posó],	which	
    means	“amount”.	Το	ποσό	[to	posó]	is	“the	amount”.		
	
S:	 Ποσό	[posó].		
	
T:	 So	 again,	 a	 change	 in	 the	 accent,	 and	 we	 get	 a	 different	 word.	 Some	 other	
    examples	 of	 this:	 μαγεία	 [mayía],	 μαγεία	 –	 this	 is	 the	 γάμα	 [gháma]	 (γ),	 no,	 like	
    the	 G	 in	 “magic”,	 but	 softened	 by	 the	 [i]	 sound	 –	 μαγεία,	 which	 means	 like	
    “magic”,	or	a	“spell”.	And	then,	μαγιά	[mayiá],	with	the	accent	on	the	[a],	on	the	
    end,	which	means	“yeast”.		
	
	 We	 could	 have,	 φίλο	 [fílo],	 no,	 which	 would	 be	 like,	 φίλος	 [fílos]	 –	 “friend”,	
    behaving	 like	 “him”,	 without	 the	 S	 (-ς)	 –	 φίλο;	 and	 then,	 φιλώ	 [filó]	 –	 “I	 kiss”.	
    Φιλώ.	But	then	also,	the	noun,	“a	kiss”	is,	ένα	φιλί	[éna	filí];	and	“kisses”	is,	φιλιά	
    [filiá],	 φιλιά.	 So	 we	 have,	 φιλιά	 –	 “kisses”,	 and	 then,	 φιλία	 [filía],	 φιλία,	 which	
    means	“friendship”.	H	φιλία	[i	filía]	–	“the	friendship”.		
	
	 Πίνω	 [píno],	 which	 means	 “I	 drink”,	 and	 then,	 πεινώ	 [pinó],	 which	 means	 “I’m	
    hungry”.	 Πωλητής	 [politís],	 πωλητής,	 which	 means	 “seller”,	 like	 in,	 πουλαώ	
    [puláo]	–	“I	sell”;	and	then,	πολίτης	[politís],	which	means	“citizen”,	like	in	“city”	–	
    πόλη	[póli].	And	we	also	saw,	of	course,	we	have,	πόλη	[póli]	for	“city”	and,	πολύ	
    [polí],	with	the	accent	afterwards	for	“very”,	or	“a	lot”.	Actually	“citizen”	is	literally	
    “city-zen”,	no,	also	in	English,	like	Greek:	πόλ-ιτης	–	πόλη.	Φορά	[forȧ],	we	said,	
    was	an	occasion,	a	time,	like,	“one	time”,	“one	occasion”	–	μία	φορά	[mía	forá].	
    And	then,	φόρα	[fóra]	means	like,	“momentum”,	“impetus”.		
	
	 So	you	need	to	be	careful	in	Greek.	You	may	feel,	like,	you	recognise	a	word,	but	if	
    the	stress	is	in	a	different	place	than	it	should	be,	then	it	might	not	be	that	word.	
    It	 might	 be	 ’cos	 the	 stress	 may	 have	 moved	 for	 grammatical	 reasons,	 as	 we’ve	
    seen,	no?	But	it	might	not	be.	So	we	really	want	to	keep	an	open	mind	and	judge	
    the	 whole	 context	 together,	 when	 we’re	 trying	 to	 understand	 spoken	 Greek,	
    rather	than	just	hanging	on	very	tightly	to	something	that	we	felt	we	recognised.	
    We	want	to	keep	an	open	mind	when	we	feel	we	recognise	things	in	Greek	–	and	
    generally,	you	know,	not	to	underestimate	the	power	of	stress	in	Greek,	to	convey	
    meaning,	both	grammatically	and	with	words,	as	we’re	seeing.		
	
	 Some	 more	 nice	 examples	 would	 be,	 λεμόνια	 [lemónia].	 I	 think	 you	 may	 guess	
    what	this	means.	Λεμόνια.		


                                                                                                457
	
S:	 Lemons.		
	
T:	 Lemons.	 Good.	 And	 this	 the	 plural,	 no?	 Like	 λεμόνι,	 λεμόνια	 [lemóni,	 lemónia],	
    neuter.	But,	λεμονιά	[lemoniá]	means	“lemon	tree”	–	not	plural	anymore,	just	one	
    lemon	tree.	Lemon	tree	–	λεμονιά.		
	
		 Πορτοκάλια	 [portokália]	 means	 “oranges”.	 But,	 πορτοκαλιά	 [portokaliá]	 means	
    “orange	tree”;	and	then,	πορτοκαλί	[portokalí].	Πορτοκαλί,	is	the	colour	orange,	
    πορτοκαλί.	And	all	of	this	is,	of	course,	sharing	its	root	with	Portugal,	the	country,	
    which	is	probably	where	the	oranges	were	coming	from.	Actually,	an	orange	is	a	
    fruit,	a	hybrid	fruit,	that	was	created	by	man,	combining,	I	believe,	a	pomelo	and	a	
    mandarin,	since	ancient	times.	So	actually,	you	can	see	in	different	languages,	it’s	
    the	 same	 word.	 Orange	 in	 English	 is	 the	 same	 as	 Spanish	 naranja;	 it’s	 the	 same	
    word	–	just	the	N	seems	to	have	got	lost	…	the	way.	A	bit	like	in	“an	orange”,	an	
    orange	 –	 naranja.	 And	 all	 of	 this	 seemingly	 entering	 from	 Arabic.	 So,	 you	 know,	
    this	fruit	tends	to	share	a	name;	just	like	“lemon”,	which	is	also	hybrid.		
	
	 So	Greek	takes	advantage	of	accent,	not	only	to	show	grammatical	things,	but	also	
    to	derive	more	meanings	from	a	limited	amount	of	sounds.	
	
	                                 	




                                                                                            458

Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	telephone?		
	
Student:	Τηλέφωνο	[tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Τηλέφωνο.	Good.	Or,	το	τηλέφωνο	[to	tiléfono],	and	we	have	the	accent	there	on	
    the	[e]	(ε),	no,	third	from	the	end.	Tηλέφωνο.	But	what	if	you	say,	His	telephone?		
	
S:	 Το	τηλέφωνό	του	[to	tiléfonó	tu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 We	 double	 the	 accent,	 no?	 Το	 τηλέφωνό	 του.	 So,	 with	 these	 longer	
    nouns,	when	we	have	the	accent	third	from	the	end,	and	we	put	the	possessive	
    word	afterwards,	we	come	up	again	on	the	end	to,	kind	of,	join	it	all	together.	So,	
    το	τηλέφωνο	–	το	τηλέφωνό	του	[to	tiléfono,	to	tiléfonó	tu].		
	
	 Τηλεφωνώ	[tilefonó],	with	the	ωμέγα	[omégha]	(ω),	with	the	“w”,	that	is	[o],	can	
    also	 mean	 “to	 telephone”,	 “to	 make	 a	 call”.	 So	 when	 you	 hear,	 τηλεφωνώ	
    [tilefonó],	with	the	accent	on	the	end,	it	might	not	necessarily	be	possession,	no?	
    Το	τηλέφωνό	του,	with	the	double	accent	or,	τηλεφωνώ	–	“I	call”.		
	
	 “The	face”	in	Greek,	the	face,	is,	το	πρόσωπο	[to	prósopo].	Tο	πρόσωπο.		
	
S:	 Το	πρόσωπο.		
	
T:	 This	actually	might	be	related,	well	in	meaning,	to	how	you	say	it	in	German,	no?	
    In	German	you	have	...	?		
	
S:	 Gesicht.		
	
T:	 Gesicht	–	which	is	like	“the	thing	you	see”,	“the	first	thing	you	see”.	And	this	might	
    be	 the	 same	 idea,	 actually:	 “προ”	 –	 first,	 “σωπο”	 –	 the	 first	 seen	 thing,	 from	 an	
    older	…	older	version	of	“see”.	So	we	have,	το	πρόσωπο	–	“the	face”.	How	would	
    you	say,	His	face?		
	
S:	 Το	πρόσωπό	του	[to	prósopó	tu].		
	
T:	 Το	πρόσωπό	του.	Good.	We	come	up	again,	on	the	end.	Το	πρόσωπό	του.	Did	you	
    see	his	face?		
	
S:	 Είδες	το	πρόσωπό	του;	[ídhes	to	prósopótu?].		
	
T:	 Did	you	see	his	face?	Είδες	το	πρόσωπό	του;	Did	you	see	my	friend’s	face?	Did	you	
    see	my	friend’s	face?		
	
S:	 Είδες	το	πρόσωπο	του	φίλου	μου;	[ídhes	to	prósopo	tu	fílu	mu?].		
	


                                                                                                459
T:	 Very	good.	Είδες	το	πρόσωπο	του	φίλου	μου;	So	here,	it’s	not	“his	face”;	it’s	“my	
    friend’s	face”.	So	not	just	with	“του”,	but,	του	φίλου	μου	[tu	fílu	mu].	So	we	don’t	
    have	to	worry	about	doubling	the	accent.	Το	πρόσωπο	του	φίλου	μου	[to	prósopo	
    tu	fílu	mu].	Είδες	το	πρόσωπο	του	φίλου	μου;		
	
	 So,	το	πρόσωπο	[to	prósopo]	is	“the	face”	and,	η	προσωπικότητα	[i	prosopikótita],	
    η	 προσωπικότητα,	 is	 “the	 personality”.	 Do	 you	 want	 to	 give	 that	 a	 try	 –	 η	
    προσωπικότητα?		
	
S:	 Η	προσωπο	...	προσωπικότητα	[prosopikótita].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Knowing	where	you	stress,	knowing	where	you	come	up	on	the	accent,	
    also	helps	with	these	longer	words,	no?	Προσωπικό	[prosopikó]	...	that’s	when	we	
    come	up,	on	the	“κό”	[kó].	Προσωπικότητα.		
	
	 So	this	means	“personality”,	and	this	“τητα”	[tita]	on	the	end	is	actually	“-ity”.	You	
    will	 find	 other	 words	 that	 correspond	 with	 “-ity”	 with”-τητα”	 on	 the	 end.	 So	 for	
    example,	“probability”,	which	is,	πιθανότητα	[pithanótita];	or	“possibility”,	which	
    is,	 δυνατότητα	 [dhinanótita],	 like	 “dynamic”.	 Δυνατότητα	 –	 “possibility”.	 So	 this	
    “-τητα”	often	corresponds	to	“-ity”.		
	
	 But	the	most	interesting	thing	about	the	word	“personality”	–	προσωπικότητα,	is	
    that	 it’s	 coming	 from	 “πρόσωπο”.	 So	 here,	 in	 silence,	 before	 we	 say	 anything,	
    Greek	says	something.	Greek	has	an	idea,	no,	that	the	personality	comes	from	the	
    face.	Now	this	might	be	an	uncomfortable	truth,	but	if	we	think	about	it,	it	does	
    hold	a	lot	of	truth,	no?	If	you	think	psychologically,	when	you	look	in	the	mirror,	
    the	face	that	you	see	will	feed	back	into	the	idea	of	yourself.	You	know,	it’s	even	
    possible	to	see	a	personality	change	when	you	cut	your	hair.	And	beyond	that,	the	
    face	 that	 the	 world	 sees,	 and	 the	 way	 they	 treat	 you,	 will	 also	 feed	 into	 your	
    personality.	 So	 there’s	 some	 wisdom	 there	 in	 the	 way	 these	 words	 are	 formed.	
    How	would	you	say,	Her	personality?		
	
S:	 Η	προσωπικότητά	της	[i	prosopikótitá	tis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Η	προσωπικότητά	της.	Because	we	have	the	accent	on	the	“κό”	[kó]	–	
    προσωπικότητα	–	third	from	the	end,	so	we	come	up	again	to	join	it	all	together.	
    Η	προσωπικότητά	της.	The	personality	of	my	friend	–	a	feminine	friend?		
	
S:	 Η	προσωπικότητα	η	...	No.	Η	προσωπικότητα	της	φίλης	μου	[i	prosopikótita	tis	fílis	
    mu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 So	 we	 don’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about	 doubling	 the	 accent	 there,	 no?	 Η	
    προσωπικότητα	 της	 φίλης	 μου.	 Προσωπικότητα	 –	 what	 might	 be	 the	 plural	 of,	
    προσωπικότητα?		
	
S:	 Προσωπικότητες	[prosopikótites].		
	


                                                                                             460
T:	 Yes.	You	can	just	look	back	to	somewhere	,	where	you	know	it,	like,	μέρα	–	μέρες	
    [méra,	méres],	and	see	what	happens.	Προσωπικότητα	–	προσωπικότητες.	Their	
    personalities	–	feminine	or	masculine,	it	can	be	either,	no?		
	
S:	 Οι	προσωπικότητές	τους	[i	prosopikótités	tus].		
	
T:	 Οι	προσωπικότητές	τους.	So	we’ve	seen	how	the	words	“to	me”,	“to	you”	–	μου,	
    σου,	 etc.,	 are	 used	 for	 possession,	 no?	 Το	 πρόσωπό	 του	 –	 “face	 to	 him”,	 “his	
    face”.	 And	 we	 can	 extend	 that	 idea	 also	 to	 say	 “my	 friend’s	 face”.	 No?	 For	
    example,	το	πρόσωπο	του	φίλου	μου,	using	the	same	“του”,	no,	and	also	putting	
    the	noun	in	“to	him”	form,	if	it’s	an	OS	“-ος”	noun,	no.	Otherwise,	we	just	lose	the	
    S	 (-ς):	 του	 άντρα	 [tu	 ándra],	 του	 Μιχάλη	 [tu	 mikháli].	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 their	
    faces?	So	we	want	the	plural	of,	πρόσωπο.		
	
S:	 Τα	πρόσωπα	[ta	prósopa].	Τα	πρόσωπά	τους	[ta	prósopá	tus].		
	
T:	 Τα	πρόσωπά	τους.		With	“τους”,	if	you	want	to	say,	“my	friends’	faces”,	“the	faces	
    of	 my	 friends”,	 instead	 of	 “their	 faces”,	 we	 have	 a	 change	 here.	 We	 use,	 τα	
    πρόσωπα	των	φίλων	μου	[ta	prósopa	ton	fílon	mu].	Τα	πρόσωπα	των	φίλων	μου	–	
    “the	faces	of	my	friends”.		
	
S:	 Τα	πρόσωπα	των	φίλων	μου.		
	
T:	 And	 in	 the	 same	 way	 that	 “τους”	 for	 “their”,	 works	 for	 masculine	 and	 feminine,	
    των	 φίλων	 μου	 [ton	 fílon	 mu]	 –	 “of	 my	 friends”,	 is	 also	 for	 masculine	 and	
    feminine.	Now	this	is	spelt	differently	to	the	singular	“τον”	[ton],	no?	This	is	spelt	
    with	the	ωμέγα	[omégha]	(ω),	the	O	that	looks	like	a	“w”.	And	also,	φίλων	[fílon]	
    is	 spelt	 in	 this	 way,	 with	 the	 O	 that	 looks	 like	 a	 “w”	 (ω).	 And	 this	 works	 for	 all	
    genders.	So,	Τα	πρόσωπα	των	φίλων	μου	[ta	prósopa	ton	fílon	mu]	–	this	can	be	
    for	male	or	female	friends.		
	
	 The	word	for	“brother”	is,	αδελφός	[adhelfós].	Αδελφός.		
	
S:	 Αδελφός.		
	
T:	 How	might	sister	be?		
	
S:	 Αδελφή	[adhelfí].		
	
T:	 Αδελφή.	And	I	should	mention	that	other	than,	αδελφός,	with	an	L	(λ),	αδελφή,	
    you	will	also	hear	and	see,	very	commonly,	“αδερ	...”,	like	with	an	R	(ρ):	αδερφός,	
    αδερφή	 [adherfós,	 adherfí].	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 My	 friend’s	 sister	 (The	 sister	 of	
    my	friend)?	No?		
	
S:	 Η	αδελφή	του	φίλου	μου	[i	adhelfí	tu	fílu	mu].		
	



                                                                                                   461
T:	 Good.	 Η	 αδελφή	 του	 φίλου	 μου.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 My	 friends’	 sister,	 in	 the	
    plural?	The	sister	of	my	friends.		
	
S:	 Η	αδελφή	των	φίλων	μου	[i	adhelfí	ton	fílon	mu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Η	 αδελφή	 των	 φίλων	 μου.	 So	 this	 “-ων”	 [on]	 ending,	 to	 express	 this	
    idea	of	possession	for	the	plural,	works	for	all	genders.	So	how	was,	the	child?		
	
S:	 Το	παιδί	[to	pedhí].		
	
T:	 Το	παιδί.	And,	the	children?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	[ta	pedhiá].		
	
T:	 Τα	παιδιά.	How	would	you	say,	The	faces	of	the	children?		
	
S:	 Τα	πρόσωπα	των	παιδιών	[ta	prósopa	ton	pedhión].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Τα	 πρόσωπα	 των	 παιδιών.	 How	 was,	 the	 toy,	 or,	 the	 game?	 Do	 you	
    remember?		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	[to	pekhnídhi].		
	
T:	 Το	παιχνίδι.	How	would	you	say,	Their	toy?		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	τους	[to	pekhnídhi	tus].		
	
T:	 Το	 παιχνίδι	 τους.	 No?	 We	 don’t	 double	 any	 accent	 here,	 because	 we	 have	 the	
    accent	 second	 from	 the	 end.	 So	 we	 don’t	 have	 any	 accent	 change.	 Το	 παιχνίδι	
    τους.	How	would	you	say,	The	toy	of	the	children?		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	των	παιδιών	[to	pekhnídhi	ton	pedhión].		
	
T:	 Το	παιχνίδι	των	παιδιών.	Very	good.	But	just,	Their	toy?		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	τους	[to	pekhnídhi	tus].		
	
T:	 Το	παιχνίδι	τους.	So	here,	in	the	plural,	we	have	a	difference,	no,	between	how	
    we	 say	 “their”,	 and	 how	 we	 say	 “of	 them”.	 No?	 Το	 παιχνίδι	 τους	 [to	 pekhnídhi	
    tus].	Το	παιχνίδι	των	παιδιών	[to	pekhnídhi	ton	pedhión].	How	would	you	say,	My	
    brother’s	(brothers’)	toy?	Now	in	English,	My	brother’s/brothers’	toy,	can	be	“the	
    toy	of	my	brother”,	or	“the	toy	of	my	brothers”.	We	don’t	understand	just	by	that	
    sentence;	 we	 need	 to	 see	 the	 bigger	 context.	 But	 in	 Greek	 we	 know	 the	
    difference.	So	give	me	first,	My	brother’s	toy,	the	singular:	The	toy	of	my	brother.		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	του	αδελφού	μου	[to	pekhnídhi	tu	adhelfú	mu].		
	


                                                                                           462
T:	 Very	 good.	 Το	 παιχνίδι	 του	 αδελφού	 μου.	 And,	 The	 toy	 of	 my	 brothers,	 in	 the	
    plural.		
	
S:	 Το	παιχνίδι	των	αδελφών	μου	[to	pekhnídhi	ton	adhelfón	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Το	 παιχνίδι	 των	 αδελφών	 μου.	 Very	 good.	 So	 on,	 αδελφός,	 αδελφή	
    [adhelfós,	adhelfí],	we	already	have	the	accent	on	the	end,	no?	But	if	we	have	a	
    longer	 word,	 we	 will	 move	 that	 accent	 forward.	 So,	 for	 example,	 what	 was	 the	
    word,	woman	–	for	woman?		
	
S:	 Γυναίκα	[yinéka].		
	
T:	 Γυναίκα.	And,	women?		
	
S:	 Γυναίκες	[yinékes].		
	
T:	 Γυναίκες.	So	with	longer	words,	even	if	they	don’t	have	the	original	accent	third	
    from	 the	 end,	 like	 “γυναίκα”	 [yinéka]	 doesn’t,	 we	 will	 see	 that,	 on	 pulling	 the	
    accent	on	it.	So,	Of	the	women?		
	
S:	 Των	γυναικών	[ton	yinekón].		
	
T:	 Των	γυναικών.	How	would	you	say,	Their	children?	Their	children.		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	τους	[ta	pedhiá	tus].		
	
T:	 Τα	παιδιαά	τους.	And,	The	children	of	the	women	(the	women’s	children)?		
	
S:	 Τα	παιδιά	των	γυναικών	[ta	pedhiá	ton	yinekón].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Τα	 παιδιά	 των	 γυναικών.	 So	 again,	 another	 situation	 where	 we	 need	 to	
    think	about	the	accent,	no?	When	we	are	adding	this	“ων”,	if	we	are	adding	it	to	a	
    word	 with	 three	 or	 more	 syllables,	 we	 may	 see	 that	 accent	 move	 towards	 it:	
    γυναίκα	–	γυναικών	[yinéka,	yinekón].	So	for	“they”,	no,	we	have	a	big	difference	
    between	 “their	 something”	 and	 “the	 something	 of	 them”.	 No?	 “Of	 my	 friends”,	
    “of	the	women”:	we	don’t	recycle	“τους”	[tus],	but	we	have	“των”	[ton],	and	we	
    also	change	the	ending	of	the	noun	to	“ων”	[on],	for	all	genders.		
	
	                                	




                                                                                            463
Complete Greek, Track 96 – Language Transfer
	
Teacher:	You	remember,	how	was,	The	teacher?		
	
Student:	Ο	δάσκαλος	[o	dháskalos].		
	
T:	 Ο	 δάσκαλος.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 The	 friends	 of	 the	 teachers	 (the	 teachers’	
    friends)?	The	friends	of	the	teachers.		
	
S:	 Οι	φίλοι	του	δασκάλου	[i	fíli	tu	dhaskálu].		
	
T:	 Of	 the	 teachers.	 So,	 Οι	 φίλοι	 του	 δασκάλου	 (we	 would	 move	 the	 accent	 there:	
    δασκάλου	[dhaskálu])	would	be	“the	teacher’s	friends”,	but	like	one	teacher,	no?	
    “The	friends	of	the	teacher”.	But	how	about,	The	friends	of	the	teachers?		
	
S:	 Οι	φίλοι	των	δασκάλων	[i	fíli	ton	dhaskálon].		
	
T:	 Good.	Οι	φίλοι	των	δασκάλων.	So	we	have	the	accent	moving	towards	the	ending	
    there,	 and,	 οι	 φίλοι	 των	 δασκάλων.	 So	 this	 “ων”	 [on]	 works	 for	 masculine	 and	
    feminine	–	this	is,	The	friends	of	the	teachers,	and	it	doesn’t	matter	if	the	teachers	
    are	masculine	or	feminine,	when	we	mean	“of	the	teachers”;	it’s	just,	δασκάλων	
    [dhaskálon].	But	just,	their	friends:	so	instead	of	“the	friends	of	the	teachers”,	just,	
    their	friends.		
	
S:	 Οι	φίλοι	τους	[i	fíli	tus].		
	
T:	 Οι	φίλοι	τους.	Very	good.	What	was,	I	write?		
	
S:	 Γράφω	[ghráfo].		
	
T:	 Γράφω.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Γράψω	[ghrápso].		
	
T:	 Γράψω.	 So	 we’ve	 seen	 various	 ways	 of	 asking	 or	 soliciting	 someone	 to	 do	
    something,	 no?	 We	 can	 say,	 Πρέπει	 να	 γράψεις	 [prépi	 na	 ghrápsis],	 Θέλω	 να	
    γράψεις	 [thélo	 na	 ghrápsis],	 or	 just,	 Να	 γράψεις	 [na	 ghrápsis],	 Μπορείς	 να	 (can	
    you?)	 γράψεις;	 [borís	 na	 ghrápsis?].	 We	 saw,	 ας	 [as]	 and	 να	 [na]	 for	 “let’s”,	 or	
    “shall	 we”.	 So	 there’s	 various	 ways	 we’ve	 seen	 of	 soliciting	 action,	 let’s	 say.	 But	
    we	also	have	a	very	direct	way	to	do	this,	in	English	and	in	Greek.	For	example,	we	
    can	 just	 say,	 “Write!”,	 no?	 “Write!”,	 like	 we	 give	 an	 order,	 “write!”,	 “write	 it	
    down!”.	In	English,	to	achieve	this,	we	just	remove	the	“to”	of	the	verb,	no?	We	
    have	 “to	 write”,	 and	 then	 we	 say	 “write!”.	 But	 in	 Greek	 we	 can’t	 do	 that,	 of	
    course.	We	have	no	“to”;	we	have	no	“to”,	to	take	away.	So	“write!”,	as	an	order	
    in	Greek	is,	γράψε	[ghrápse].	Γράψε.		
	
S:	 Γράψε.		


                                                                                                464
	
T:	 So	what	do	we	do	to	get,	γράψε?		
	
S:	 We	took	the	closed	version.		
	
T:	 Good.		
	
S:	 And	we	changed	the	ending	to	an	[ε]	(ε).		
	
T:	 Good.	To	an	Ε	(ε),	an	[e].	Very	good.	Γράψε	[ghrápse].	So	this	is	the	informal,	no,	
    when	we	talk	to	one	person,	informally.	So,	εσύ	γράψε	[esí	ghrápse].		
	
	 “The	name”,	the	name,	is,	το	όνομα	[to	ónoma].	Το	όνομα.		
	
S:	 Το	όνομα.		
	
T:	 Related	 to	 “anonymous”	 –	 anonymous,	 like,	 without	 name.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	
    your	name?	
	
S:	 Το	όνομά	σου	[to	ónomá	su].		
	
T:	 Good.	Very	well	done	for	coming	back	up	there	on	the	end,	with	the	accent.	Το	
    όνομά	σου.	If	the	accent	was	on	the	“νο”	[no],	if	it	were,	το	ονόμα	[to	onóma],	
    then	we	wouldn’t,	not	really,	but	it’s	not.	Το	όνομα	–	το	όνομά	σου	[to	ónoma,	to	
    ónomá	su].	Write	your	name	here.		
	
S:	 Γράψε	το	όνομά	σου	εδώ	[ghrápse	to	ónomá	su	edhó].		
	
T:	 Good.	Γράψε	το	όνομά	σου	εδώ.	How	would	you	say,	The	names?		
	
S:	 Τα	ονόματα	[ta	onómata].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	We	end	in	A	(α)	[a],	no?	So	we	go	into	our	plural	with	TA	(τα)	[ta]:	το	
    όναμα	 –	 τα	 ονόματα	 [to	 ónoma,	 ta	 onómata].	 And	 we	 also	 move	 that	 accent	
    forward,	 when	 we	 add	 that	 extra	 syllable:	 το	 όνομα	 –	 τα	 ονόματα.	 Write	 their	
    names	here.	Write	their	names	here.		
	
S:	 Γράψε	τα	ονόματα	τους	...	τα	ονο	...	τα	ονόματά	τους	εδώ	[ghrápse	…	ta	onómatá	
    tus	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Γράψε	τα	ονόματά	τους	εδώ	[ghrápse	ta	onómatá	tus	edhó].	So	again,	
    two	accents,	no?	We	have	the	accent	on	the	“νό”	[nó]	here,	but	that	is	again	the	
    third	from	the	end,	because	we	added	“τα”	[ta].	So,	Γράψε	τα	ονόματά	τους	εδώ.	
    How	would	you	say,	Write	the	children’s	names	here?		
	
S:	 Γράψε	τα	ονόματα	των	παιδιών	εδώ	[ghrápse	ta	onómata	ton	pedhión	edhó].		
	


                                                                                         465
T:	 Very	good.	The	“ών”	[on]	takes	the	accent	there	–	like	before,	when	we	had,	παιδί	
    –	 παιδιού	 [pedhí,	 pedhiú].	 Here	 we	 have,	 παιδί	 –	 παιδιών	 [pedhí,	 pedhión].	
    Γράψε	τα	ονόματα	των	παιδιών	εδώ.	And	we	haven’t	doubled	the	accent	on,	τα	
    ονόματα	[ta	onómata],	because	it	wasn’t	with,	τους	[tus],	but	with,	των	παιδιών	
    [ton	 pedhión].	 So	 there	 we	 don’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about	 doubling	 the	 accent:	 τα	
    ονόματα	των	παιδιών.		
	
	 Σημαίνει	[siméni],	σημαίνει,	means	“It	means”.	“It	means”	–	σημαίνει.		
	
S:	 Σημαίνει.		
	
T:	 This	is	like	“semantic”.	No?	We	said	that	“semantic”	in	English	is	a	word	meaning	
    “meaning”.	 And	 we	 saw,	 σημαντικός	 [simandikós],	 in	 Greek	 as	 well,	 meaning	
    “important”	or	“meaningful”;	and	σημαίνει	[siméni]	–	“it	means”.	So,	how	would	
    you	say,	What	does	it	mean?		
	
S:	 Τι	σημαίνει;	[ti	siméni?].		
	
T:	 Τι	σημαίνει;	How	would	you	say,	What	does	your	name	mean?		
	
S:	 Τι	σημαίνει	το	όνομά	...	Ah!	...	Τι	σνμαίνει	το	όνομά	σου;	[	…	ti	siméni	to	ónomá	
    su?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Τι	σημαίνει	το	όνομά	σου;	[ti	siméni	to	ónomá	su?]	And	this	is	a	good	way	
    of	 learning	 just	 general	 meanings	 in	 Greek	 –	 asking	 people	 what	 their	 names	
    mean,	 you	 know.	 Like	 I	 mentioned,	 Γρηγόρης	 [ghrighóris]	 means	 like	 “quick”	 or	
    “wakeful”.	 Αnd	 that’s	 a	 nice	 connection	 to,	 γρήγορα	 [ghríghora]	 –	 “quickly”,	 or,	
    γρήγορος	[ghríghoros]	–	“quick”.	So	you	can	ask	people	what	their	names	mean	to	
    kind	 of	 amplify	 your	 vocabulary	 in	 Greek.	 But,	 you	 know,	 not	 everybody	 knows	
    what	their	names	mean,	especially	if	it’s	not	obvious	by	the	name.	So	maybe	you	
    could	ask,	Do	you	know	what	your	name	means?		
	
S:	 Ξέρεις	τι	σημαίνει	το	όνομά	σου;	[kséris	ti	siméni	to	ónomá	su?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Ξέρεις	 τι	 σημαίνει	 το	 όνομά	 σου;	 And	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 to	 more	
    than	one	person,	Do	you	know	what	your	names	mean?	Do	you	know	what	your	
    names	mean?	Now	we’re	talking	plurally,	to	more	than	one	person.		
	
S:	 Ξέρετε	τι	σημαίνουν	τα	όνομά	σας;	[ksérete	ti	siménun	to	ónomá	sas?].		
	
T:	 Very	good	for	changing	the	verbs,	no?	But	we	didn’t	change	the	noun.		
	
S:	 Yeah.	Um.	Ξέρετε	τι	σνμαίνουν	τα	ονόματά	σας;	[ksérete	ti	siménun	ta	onómatá	
    sas?].		
	
T:	 Ξέρετε	τι	σνμαίνουν	τα	ονόματά	σας;	Very	good.		
	


                                                                                           466
	 So	if	you	don’t	put	these	stresses,	these	extra	stresses	on	the	words,	of	course	you	
  will	be	perfectly	understood.	But	it’s	nice	to	listen	out	and	be	reminded	of	these	
  rules,	so	we	can	do	it	ourselves	and	just	sound	much	more	fluent	and	native.	The	
  more	fluent	and	the	more	native	we	sound,	the	less	we	distract	from	the	meaning	
  of	what	we’re	saying,	when	we	speak	another	language.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	write?		
	
Student:	Γράφω	[ghráfo].		
	
T:	 Γράφω.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Γράψω	[ghrápso].		
	
T:	 Γράψω.	And	the	order,	Write!		
	
S:	 Γράψε	[ghrápse].		
	
T:	 Γράψε.	Good.	So	usually,	we	build	this	order	by	using	the	closed	form	of	the	verb,	
    and	an	E	(ε)	ending.	So,	what	was,	I	play?		
	
S:	 Παίζω	[pézo].		
	
T:	 Παίζω.	Good.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Παίξω	[pékso].		
	
T:	 Παίξω.	And,	Play!,	as	an	order?	Play!		
	
S:	 Παίξε	[pékse].		
	
T:	 Παίξε.	How	is,	I	wait?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	[periméno].		
	
T:	 Περιμένω.	So	with,	περιμένω,	we	don’t	have	a	closed	version	to	use	for	the	order,	
    so	 we	 can	 just	 use,	 περιμένω.	 But	 when	 we	 have	 longer	 verbs,	 like	 “περιμένω”,	
    we	will	want	the	accent	third	from	the	end	in	the	order:	we	will	add	our	E	(ε)	on	
    the	end,	and	have	our	accent	third	from	the	end.	So	how	would	you	say,	Wait!		
	
S:	 Περίμενε	[perímene].		
	
T:	 Περίμενε.	But	without	context,	what	else	could	“περίμενε”	mean?	Περίμενε.		
	
S:	 He	was	waiting.		
	
T:	 He	waited.	He	was	waiting.	No?	But	it’s	so	obvious	when	someone	is	giving	you	an	
    order.	It’s	pretty	hard	to	get	these	confused.		
	
	 What	was,	I	change?		
	


                                                                                          468
S:	 Αλλάζω	[alázo].		
	
T:	 Αλλάζω.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Αλλάξω	[alákso].		
	
T:	 Αλλάξω.	Change!		
	
S:	 ‘Αλλαξε	[álakse].		
	
T:	 ‘Αλλαξε.	And	what	else	could	this	mean?		
	
S:	 He	was	changing;	or,	He	changed.		
	
T:	 Not	either.		
	
S:	 Ah.	He	changed.		
	
T:	 He	 changed,	 only,	 no?	 Because	 here	 we	 have	 an	 open	 and	 a	 closed	 version.	 So,	
    άλλαξε	[álakse]	is	just	“he	changed”	or	“she	changed”	or	“it	changed”.		
	
	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say	 “Change	 it!”,	 “Buy	 it!”,	 “Wait	 for	 me!”	 …	 when	 we	 make	 a	
    positive	 order,	 when	 we	 say,	 “to	 do	 something”,	 the	 word	 for	 “it”,	 for	 “me”,	 it	
    goes	after	the	verb.	So	again	tell	me	how	do	you	say,	Change!	Not	“Change	it!”,	
    just,	Change!		
	
S:	 ‘Αλλαξε	[álakse].		
	
T:	 ‘Αλλαξε.	And	we	have	the	accent	third	from	the	end,	no,	in	longer	verbs,	when	we	
    make	the	order.	‘Αλλαξε.	Now	if	you	say	“Change	it”,	well	here	we	have	another	
    example	of	a	double	accent.	We	will	come	up	on	the	end	again,	on	the	end	of	the	
    verb,	to	join	that	all	together	and	make	it	sound	all	connected.	Change	it!	So	how	
    would	you	say	that?	Change	it!		
	
S:	 ‘Αλλαξέ	το	[álaksé	to].		
	
T:	 Άλλαξέ	το.	Very	good.	So	we	get	an	accent	on	the	[α]	(Ά/ά),	like	always,	and	then	
    up	again	on	the	end.	‘Αλλαξέ	το.	How	would	you	say,	Ηe	changed	it?	He	changed	
    it.		
	
S:	 Το	άλλαξε	[to	álakse].		
	
T:	 Το	 άλλαξε.	 Very	 good.	 So	 you	 couldn’t	 get	 this	 confused,	 no,	 with,	 άλλαξέ	 το	
    [álaksé	to].		How	would	you	say,	Wait!	again	–	giving	the	order,	Wait!		
	
S:	 Περίμενε	[perímene].		
	


                                                                                             469
T:	 Περίμενε.	Wait	for	me.		
	
S:	 Περ	...Περιμένε	με.	Περιμέν	...	No	wait.	Περίμενέ	με	[	…	perímené	me].		
	
T:	 Περίμενέ	 με	 [perímené	 me].	 Νο?	 Περίμενε	 –	 περίμενέ	 με	 [perímene,	 perímené	
    me].	How	would	you	say,	He	waited	for	me?		
	
S:	 Με	περίμενε	[me	perímene].		
	
T:	 Με	περίμενε.	How	would	you	say,	Buy!	–	giving	the	order.	Buy!		
	
S:	 Αγόρασε	[aghórase].		
	
T:	 Αγόρασε.	 Good.	 Αγόρασε.	 Again	 the	 accent	 third	 from	 the	 end.	 Αγόρασε.	 And,	
    Buy	it!		
	
S:	 Αγoρασέ	το	[aghorasé	to].		
	
T:	 Yes,	 but	 we	 don’t	 just	 move	 the	 accent	 –	 we	 double	 it,	 no?	 So	 we	 have	 two:	
    αγόρασε	–	αγόρασέ	το	[aghórase,	aghórasé	to].	Like	I	said,	you	will	come	across	
    things	 in	 Greek	 that	 remind	 you	 of	 all	 of	 these	 rules,	 and	 seem	 impossible	 to	
    remember.	 And	 when	 you	 get	 those	 reminders,	 you	 realise	 it’s	 a	 very	 finite	
    amount	 of	 rules,	 actually	 –	 when	 you	 come	 across	 them	 and	 you	 get	 those	
    reminders	again,	that	this	thing	happens	or	something	else	happens.	
	
	 So	 for	 example,	 you	 might	 see	 around	 Greece,	 or	 on	 the	 Internet	 in	 Greek,	
    αγόρασέ	το	με	δέκα	ευρώ	[aghórasé	to	me	dhéka	evró],	for	example;	“buy	it	with	
    ten	euros”,	you	know,	for	some	offer.	And	that	will	remind	you,	ah,	okay,	why	is	it	
    happening	 there?	 Why	 do	 we	 have	 the	 double	 accent:	 αγόρασέ	 το?	 Especially	
    when	 you	 see	 it	 written;	 you	 see	 a	 written	 accent	 on	 the	 [o]	 (“ό”),	 and	 then	
    another	one	on	the	[e]	(“έ”).	 Then	you	can	think	about	 why	that’s	there,	and	in	
    this	way	it	reminds	you	of	the	rule	–	that	we	are	connecting	“αγόρασέ”	and	“το”.	
    Aγόρασέ	το	με	δέκα	ευρώ.		
	
	 And	this	is	also	another	example	of	prepositions,	these	little	words	like,	με,	σε,	για	
    [me,	 se,	 ya],	 not	 crossing	 over	 too	 well	 from	 one	 language	 to	 another,	 no?	 In	
    English	we’d	say,	“Buy	it	for	ten	euros”,	no,	but	in	Greek,	“Buy	it	with	ten	euros”.		
	
	 If	you	want	to	give	an	order	to	a	third	person,	like	to	him	or	her,	like	in	English,	
    “Let	him	write”,	you	know.	“Let	him	write”,	it’s	like,	okay,	we	may	mean,	“Leave	
    him	to	do	it”,	or	we	may	mean,	like	you	know,	“He	should	do	it”.	We	can	use	“να”	
    [na]	in	Greek,	to	do	this.	So	how	would	you	say	that?	Let	him	write.		
	
S:	 Να	γράψε	[na	ghrápse].		
	
T:	 After	“να”,	we	just	need	to	use	our	normal	verb	endings.	So	it’s	just	literally,	“να,	
    he	writes”.		


                                                                                           470
	
S:	 Να	γράψει	[na	ghrápsi].		
	
T:	 Να	γράψει.	So	this	is	like,	“Let	him	write”.	Να	γράψει,	or,	Να	γράφει	[na	ghráfi],	
    depending	 on	 the	 context.	 You	 know,	 maybe	 he	 wants	 to	 be	 a	 writer,	 and	 we	
    want	to	say	something	more	like,	“Let	him	be	a	writer.”	So,	Να	γράφει.	Let	her	buy	
    it.	Let	her	buy	it.		
	
S:	 Να	το	αγοράσει	[na	to	aghorási].		
	
T:	 Να	το	αγοράσει.	Να	το	αγοράσει	αυτή	[na	to	aghorási	aftí].	So	when	we	use	“να”	
    [na],	we	know	where	everything	goes,	no?	–	the	“το”	before	the	verb.	Everything	
    behave	like	it	usually	does.	Να	το	αγοράσει.		
	
	 We	can	also	do	this	with	“you”,	no,	for	more	emphasis.	So,	for	example,	you	could	
    say,	Αγόρασέ	το	[aghórasé	to],	you	know,	“Buy	it!”	–	αγόρασέ	το.	Or,	“να	–	you	
    buy	 it,	 you	 know.	 And	 let’s	 use	 the	 word	 for	 “you”	 to	 give	 that	 emphasis,	 no?	
    Otherwise	we	will	just	say,	αγόρασέ	το.	But	imagine,	you	know,	you	want	to	say,	
    you	 know,	 like:	 You	 should	 be	 the	 one	 that	 buys	 it.	 “Να	 –	 you	 buy	 it”.	 So	 how	
    would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Να	το	αγοράσεις	εσύ	[na	to	aghorásis	esí].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Να	 το	 αγοράσεις	 εσύ.	 So	 we	 don’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about	 any	 different	
    ending	for	the	order,	no?	With	“να”	[na],	we	know	how	everything	behaves.	Να	το	
    αγοράσεις	 εσύ	 [na	 to	 aghorásis	 esí].	 You	 guys	 should	 buy	 it.	 You	 guys	 should	 be	
    the	ones	that	buy	it.	Να	...	?		
	
S:	 Να	το	αγοράσετε	εσείς	[na	to	aghorásete	esís].		
	
T:	 Να	 το	 αγοράσετε	 εσείς.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 “Buy	 it”,	 to	 more	 than	 one	 person,	
    “Buy	it”	–	instead	of,	αγοράσετε	[aghorásete],	we	have,	αγοράστε	[aghoráste].	So	
    the	 “ετε”	 [ete],	 the	 [e]	 (ε)	 of	 the	 “ετε”	 gets	 contracted	 when	 we’re	 making	 the	
    order.	Αγοράστε.		
	
S:	 Αγοράστε.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	“Buy!”,	no,	as	an	order	to	more	than	one	person.	So,	instead	of	adding	
    “ετε”	[ete]	for	the	“you”	plural,	the	[e]	(ε)	gets	swallowed	up.	Well	no,	not	always,	
    no,	 but	 it	 does	 get	 contracted	 away,	 especially	 after	 an	 S	 (σ).	 And	 as	 we	 know,	
    what	most	of	our	closed	forms	end	in,	is	an	S	[s],	no:	“ξ”	[ks],	“ψ”	[ps],	“σ”	[s].	So,	
    most	of	the	time	we	will	just	see	TE	(“τε”):	αγοράστε	[aghoráste].	How	would	you	
    say,	Buy	it,	to	more	than	one	person?		
	
S:	 Αγοράστε	το	[aghoráste	to].		
	



                                                                                              471
T:	 Αγοράστε	το.	And	here	we	don’t	double	the	accent,	no?	We	don’t	have	the	accent	
    third	 from	 the	 end	 on,	 αγοράστε.	 So,	 we	 don’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about	 that	 “το”	
    causing	the	accent	to	double.	Αγοράστε	το.		
	
	 What	is,	I	try?			
	
S:	 Προσπαθώ	[prospathó].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθώ.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθήσω	[prospathíso].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθήσω.	How	would	you	say,	Try,	talking	to	one	person?	Try!		
	
S:	 Προσπάθησε	[prospáthise].		
	
T:	 Προσπάθησε.	 Good.	 Now,	 talking	 to	 more	 than	 one	 person,	 we’re	 going	 to	 add	
    “ετε”	[ete],	but	the	“ε”	is	going	to	get	contracted	away.	So	how	would	that	sound?		
	
S:	 Προσπαθήστε	[prospathíste].		
	
T:	 Προσπαθήστε.	And	the	accent	is	on	the	[i]	(“ή”):	προσπαθήστε,	as	if	it	were	third	
    from	 the	 end,	 as	 if	 that	 [e]	 (“ε”)	 didn’t	 disappear	 –	 as	 if	 it	 were,	 προσπαθήσετε	
    [prospathísete].	 So	 when	 we	 contract	 it,	 we	 don’t	 move	 the	 accent:	
    προσπαθήσετε	 –	 προσπαθήστε	 [prospathísete,	 prospathíste];	 αγοράσετε	 –	
    αγοράστε	 [aghorásete,	 aghoráste].	 What	 if	 you	 wanted	 to	 say,	 “να”,	 you	 know,	
    like,	You	guys	should	try,	and	give	that	extra	emphasis.	Just,	“να	–	you	guys	try”.	
    How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Να	προσπαθήστε	[na	prospathíste].		
	
T:	 So,	προσπαθήστε,	is	when	you	give	the	order,	no,	that	very	direct	order.	But	when	
    we	use	“να”	[na],	when	we	use	“ας”	[as],	when	we	use	a	different	way	of	showing	
    that	 we	 want	 someone	 to	 do	 something,	 then	 everything	 behaves	 as	 we	 would	
    expect	it	to.		
	
S:	 Να	προσπαθήσετε	[na	prospathísete].		
	
T:	 Να	 προσπαθήσετε.	 Να	 προσπαθήσετε	 εσείς	 [na	 prospathísete	 esís].	 You	 know,	
    You	guys	should	try;	we	are	trying.	How	would	you	say,	Play,	talking	to	more	than	
    one	person?		
	
S:	 Παίξτε	[pékste].		
	
T:	 Παίξτε.	Very	good.		I	take.	What	was,	I	take?		
	
S:	 Παίρνω	[pérno].		


                                                                                               472
	
T:	 Παίρνω.	 Good.	 So	 we	 have,	 παίρνω	 [pérno]	 and,	 πάρω	 [páro].	 No?	 How	 would	
    you	say,	Call	me	(take	me	phone)	when	you	want?	Call	me	when	you	want.	
	
S:	 Πάρε	με	τηλέφωνο	όταν	θέλεις	[páre	me	tiléfono	ótan	thélis].		
	
T:		Good.	 The	 word	 for	 “when”	 here	 is	 not	 a	 question,	 so	 we	 use,	 όταν	 [ótan],	 not	
    πότε	[póte].	Πάρε	με	τηλέφωνο	όταν	θέλεις.	Call	me	when	you	want.		
	
	 But	we	could	also	use,	όποτε	[ópote].	So	we	have,	πότε	[póte]	for	“when”,	and	if	
    we	add	an	“o”	to	this	–	όποτε	–	and	accent	that	“ό”	(όποτε	[ópote]),	we	get	the	
    word	for	“whenever”.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	Call	me	whenever	you	want,	you	can	
    say,	όποτε.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Πάρε	με	τηλέφωνο	όποτε	θέλεις	[páre	me	tiléfono	ópote	thélis].		
	
T:	 Πάρε	με	τηλέφωνο	όποτε	θέλεις.		And	 I	 mentioned	 that,	 θέλεις	 [thélis]	 can	 also	
    contract	to,	θες	[thes],	so	it’s	very	common	to	hear,	“όποτε	θες”	[ópote	thes].	So	
    actually,	 we	 can	 add	 an	 “o”	 to	 the	 beginning	 of	 question	 words,	 to	 get	 this	
    meaning	of	“ever”,	in	English.	For	example,	we	have	the	word	for	“what”,	which	
    is?		
	
S:	 Τι	[ti].		
	
T:	 Τι.	And,	whatever,	is?		
	
S:	 Ότι	[oti].		
	
T:		Ότι.	 Good.	 But	 “ότι”	 also	 means	 ...	 what	 else	 does	 “ότι”	 mean?	 Νομίζω	 ότι	
    [nomízo	óti].		
	
S:	 That.		
	
T:	 That.	Νομίζω	ότι	–	I	believe	that;	I	think	that.	So	“ό,τι”	of	“whatever”,	is	actually	
    written	O,TI	–	“ό	-	comma	-	τ	-	ι	;	a	comma,	no,	not	an	apostrophe,	a	comma,	and	
    that	 makes	 one	 word:	 “ό	 -	 comma	 -	 τ	 -	 ι”,	 to	 differentiate	 it	 from	 the	 “ότι”	 of	
    “that”.	So	we	have	“ό,τι”	–	“whatever”.	You	could	say,	Take	whatever	you	want.		
	
S:	 Πάρε	ό,τι	θέλεις	[páre	óti	thélis].		
	
T:	 Πάρε	 ό,τι	 θέλεις.	 Πάρε	 ό,τι	 θες	 [páre	 óti	 thes].	 Take	 whatever	 you	 want.	 You	
    might	 also	 hear	 in	 Greek,	 “ό,τι	 να	 ’ναι”	 [óti	 na’ne],	 for	 “whatever”,	 but	 in	 that	
    sense	of,	“Oh,	whatever!”	You	know,	Whatever!	–	ό,τι	να	’ναι.		
	
S:	 Ό,τι	να	’ναι.		
	
T:		What	do	you	think	it	means	literally	–	Ό,τι	να	’ναι?

T:	 Yes.	Να	’ναι.	It’s	...	what	is,	να	’ναι?		
	
S:	 Να	είναι	[na	íne].		
	
T:	 Good.	Exactly.	Να	είναι,	contracted.	Ό,τι	να	’ναι	–	“Whatever	it	be”.	What	is	the

Teacher:	What	was,	I	take?		
	
Student:	Παίρνω	[pérno].		
	
T:	 Παίρνω.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Πάρω	[páro].		
	
T:	 Πάρω.	Call	me;	Take	me	phone?		
	
S:	 Πάρε	με	τηλέφωνο	[páre	me	tiléfono].		
	
T:	 Πάρε	με	τηλέφωνο.	Good.		
	
	 With	these	shorter	verbs,	when	we	make	orders	–	so	mostly	just	short	verbs	of	a	
    syllable	or	two,	like	“πάρε”,	no	–	when	we	add	a	word	on	the	end	with	T	(τ),	so,	
    “το,	 τα,	 τους,	 την”	 [to,	 ta,	 tus,	 tin],	 any	 of	 those,	 we	 can	 have	 a	 contraction.	 So	
    instead	of	saying,	πάρε	το	[páre	to],	we	say,	πάρ’	το	[pár’to].	Πάρ’	το.		
	
S:	 Πάρ’	το.		
	
T:	 But	not	when	we	add	“me”	(με	[με]),	no?	How	was,	Call	me?		
	
S:	 Πάρε	με	[páre	me].		
	
T:	 Πάρε	 με.	 So,	 when	 we	 have	 one	 of	 these	 with	 T	 (τ),	 no	 –	 “το,	 τα”,	 etc.,	 we	 can	
    contract.	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 Take	 it	 whenever	 you	 want?	 Take	 it	 whenever	
    you	want.		
	
S:	 Πάρ’	το	όποτε	θέλεις	[pár’to	ópote	thélis].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Πάρ’	 το	 όποτε	 θέλεις.	 Πάρ’	 το	 όποτε	 θες	 [pár’to	 ópote	 thes].	 Take	 them	
    (and	we	mean	a	masculine	“them”)	…	take	them	whenever	you	want.		
	
S:	 Πάρ’	τους	όποτε	θες	[pár’tus	ópote	thes].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πάρ’	τους	όποτε	θες.	If	we	had	things	of	a	mixed	gender,	what	would	we	
    use	to	say,	Take	them	whenever	you	want?		
	
S:	 The	same.	Πάρ’	τους	όποτε	θες.		
	
T:	 You	 would	 use	 “τους”	 [tus]?	 So	 “τους”,	 we	 can	 use	 for	 people	 of	 mixed	 gender.	
    But	when	we	are	talking	of	things	of	mixed	gender,	we	would	just	use	…	?		
	
S:	 Okay.	Πάρ’	τα.	Πάρ’	τα	όποτε	θες	[pár’ta	ópote	thes].	


                                                                                                  475
	
T:	 Πάρ’	 τα	 όποτε	 θες.	 No?	 So	 things	 of	 a	 mixed	 gender	 are	 just	 “things”,	 like	
    πραγμάτα	–	τα	πραγμάτα	[prághmata,	ta	prághmata].	Πάρ’	τα	όποτε	θες	[pár’ta	
    ópote	thes].	But	like	I	said,	this	contraction	of,	πάρε	[páre]	to,	πάρ’	το	[pár’to]	or,	
    πάρ’	τα	[pár’ta]	–	only	when	we	have	these	words	beginning	T	(τ).	So	if	you	say,	
    for	example,	Call	us;	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Πάρε	μας	[páre	mas].		
	
T:	 Πάρε	μας.	Πάρε	μας	τηλέφωνο	[páre	mas	tiléfono].		
	
	 We	had,	δείχνω	[dhíkhno]	and,	δείξω	[dhíkso],	for	“I	show”.	And	how	do	you	say,	
    Show	–	giving	the	order,	to	one	person.		
	
S:	 Δείξε	[dhíkse].		
	
T:	 Δείξε.	And	to	more	than	one	person?		
	
S:	 Δείξτε	[dhíkste].		
	
T:	 Δείξτε.	Show	me	it.	Show	me	it	(still	to	more	than	one	person).		
	
S:	 Δείξτε	μου	το	[dhíkste	mu	to].		
	
T:	 Δείξτε	μου	το.	So,	whereas	usually	we	have	the	personal	one	first,	we	have,	μου	
    [mu]	 or,	 σου	 [su]	 or,	 μας	 [mas]	 first,	 when	 we	 have	 these	 little	 words	 after	 the	
    verb,	in	this	situation	where	we	give	orders,	then	we	see	much	more	flexibility	in	
    the	 word	 order.	 So	 we	 could	 have,	 like	 in	 English,	 Show	 me	 it	 –	 δείξστε	 μου	 το	
    [dhíkste	mu	to]	or,	Show	it	to	me.	So	how	would	that	be,	still	talking	formally,	or	
    plurally	to	more	than	one	person?	Show	it	to	me.		
	
S:	 Δείξτε	το	μου	[dhíkste	to	mu].		
	
T:	 Δείξτε	το	μου.	How	is,	Show	–	talking	just	to	one	person.	Show!		
	
S:	 Δείξε	[dhíkse].		
	
T:	 Δείξε.	 And	 this	 one	 can	 contract	 with	 the	 “το”,	 no?	 So	 how	 would	 that	 sound?	
    Show	it!		
	
S:	 Δείξε	το.	Δείξ’	το	[dhíks’to].		
	
T:	 Δείξ’	 το.	 Νο?	 We	 can’t	 contract	 “δείξτε”	 [dhíkste]	 and	 “το”	 [to],	 no?	 That’s	 too	
    difficult.	But	“δείξε”	and	“το”	–	that’s	no	problem:	δείξ’	το.	Show	it	to	me!		
	
S:	 Δείξ’	το	μου	[dhíks’to	mu].		
	


                                                                                               476
T:	 Δείξ’	το	μου.	Show	them	to	me	(things).		
	
S:	 Δείξ’	τα	μου	[dhíks’ta	mu].		
	
T:	 Δείξ’	τα	μου.	Show	them	to	us.		
	
S:	 Δείξ’	τα	μας	[dhíks’ta	mas].		
	
T:	 Δείξ’	τα	μας.	And	if	you	say,	Show	us	it	–	in	that	order.	Show	us	it.		
	
S:	 Δείξε	μας	το	[dhíkse	mas	to].		
	
T:	 Δείξε	μας	το.	So	we	can’t	contract	“μας”	and	“δείξε”,	because	“μας”	[mas]	doesn’t	
    begin	with	T	(τ),	like	“το”	[to]	and	“τους”	[tus].	So	the	fact	that	we	can	contract	
    these	beginning	with	T	(τ),	is	probably	why	we	break	our	normal	word	order	here,	
    no	–	to	be	able	to	contract	them.	Δέιξ’	το	μας.		
	
	 If	you	want	to	say,	“Don’t	show	me”,	then	this	is	quite	different.	You	will	say,	Μην	
    μου	το	δείξεις	[min	mu	to	dhíksis].	Μην	μου	το	δείξεις.		
	
S:	 Μην	μου	το	δείξεις.		
	
T:	 So	we	have	“μην”	[min]	for	“not”	or	“don’t”	here,	rather	than	“δεν”	[dhen].	But	
    everything	else	continues	like	normal,	no?	We	have	the	small	words	back	at	the	
    beginning,	before	the	verb	in	their	normal	positions,	no?	But	after	“μην”,	as	you	
    can	 notice	 in,	 Μην	 μου	 το	 δείξεις,	 we	 also	 have	 to	 choose	 –	 we	 have	 to	 decide	
    whether	we	want	the	open	or	the	closed	form	of	the	verb.	So,	Mην	μου	το	δείξεις	
    [min	mu	to	dhíksis].	Don’t	show	me	it.	But,	Don’t	show	me	them.		
	
S:	 Μην	μου	τα	δείξεις	[min	mu	ta	dhíksis].		
	
T:	 Μην	μου	τα	δείξεις.	What	if	you	are	talking	to	more	than	one	person?	Don’t	show	
    me	them.	
	
S:	 Μην	μου	τα	δείξετε	[min	mu	ta	dhíksete].		
	
T:	 Μην	 μου	 τα	 δείξετε.	 Good.	 Don’t	 show	 them	 (things)	 to	 me	 (to	 more	 than	 one	
    person):	Μην	μου	τα	δείξετε.	So	actually,	the	negative	orders	are	much	simpler,	
    no,	than	the	positive,	in	Greek.	For	example,	if	you	contrast,	Wait	for	me;	how	is,	
    Wait	for	me?		
	
S:	 Περίμενέ	με	[perímené	me].		
	
T:	 Good.	Περίμενέ	με.	 So	we	have	to	think	about	having	the	accent	third	from	the	
    end,	and	adding	our	E	(ε),	for	the	order,	and	then	when	we	put	“με”	[me],	pulling	
    the	accent	back	up	again.	Περίμενέ	με.	As	opposed	to,	Don’t	wait	for	me,	which	is	
    much	simpler.		


                                                                                             477
	
S:	 Μην	με	περίμενεις	[min	me	periménis].		
	
T:	 Μην	 με	 περίμενεις.	 Good.	 But,	 you	 know,	 if	 we	 don’t	 want	 to	 think	 our	 way	
    through,	 περίμενέ	 με,	 we	 can	 also	 just	 say,	 Μπόρεις	 [borís],	 no,	 “can	 you”	 –	
    Μπόρεις	να	με	περίμενεις	[borís	na	me	periménis].	So	if	we	want	to	communicate	
    something	quickly,	we	can	find	other	ways	of	expressing	what	we	want	to	happen.	
    How	would	you	say,	Wait!	–	as	an	order	to	more	than	one	person?		
	
S:	 Περιμέντε	[periménte].		
	
T:	 It	might	sound	like	“περιμέντε”	[periménte],	but	actually,	here,	we	don’t	contract	
    normally:	περιμένετε	[periménete].	But	when	people	speak	fast,	and	we	have	the	
    accent	third	from	the	end,	it	might	very	well	sound	like,	περιμέντε	[periménte]	…		
    περιμένετε	[periménete],	with	a	very	soft	E	(ε).	Wait	for	me	–	to	more	than	one	
    person.		
	
S:	 Περιμένετέ	με	[periméneté	me].		
	
T:	 Περιμένετέ	με.	But,	Don’t	wait	for	me	–	still	formal	or	plural.		
	
S:	 Μην	με	περιμένετε	[min	me	periménete].		
	
T:	 Μην	με	περιμένετε.	What	is,	I	do,	or,	I	make?		
	
S:	 Κάνω	[káno].		
	
T:	 Κάνω.	So	we	have,	κάνω	–	“I	do”,	and	to	give	an	order	to	one	person,	we	would	
    say,	κάνε	[káne],	or	to	more	than	one	person,	or	formally,	we	actually	have,	κάντε	
    [kánde]	or,	κάντε	[káde].	So	whilst	we	don’t	usually	contract	“ετε”	[ete]	to	N	(ν),	
    with	this	common	verb	we	do,	and	this	gives	us	N-T	(ν-τ)	together,	which	give	us	a	
    N-D	 [nd]	 sound,	 or	 just	 a	 D	 [d]	 sound:	 κάντε,	 κάντε	 [kánde,	 káde].	 So	 whilst	 we	
    wouldn’t	usually	contract	our	“ετε”	after	an	N	(ν),	this	very	common	verb	is	a	bit	
    irregular.	We	get,	κάντε	[kánde]	or,	κάνετε	[kánete];	you	can	hear	both,	but	κάντε	
    [kánde]	is	very	common.	So	how	would	you	say,	Do	it	(still	formal	or	plural)?		
	
S:	 Κάνετέ	το	[káneté	to].		
	
T:	 So	 if	 we	 go	 from,	 κάνετε	 –	 κάνετέ	 το;	 and	 if	 we	 go	 from,	 κάντε	 [kánde],	 much	
    more	simple	–	we	don’t	have	to	worry	about	any	double	accent:	κάντε	το	[kánde	
    to].	Don’t	do	it	(still	to	more	than	one	person).		
	
S:	 Μην	το	κάνετε	[min	to	kánete].		
	
T:	 Μην	το	κάνετε.	How	about	to	one	person?	Do!	–	giving	the	order,	Do!		
	
S:	 Κάνε	[káne].		


                                                                                             478
	
T:	 Κάνε.	And	how	would	you	say,	Do	it!		
	
S:	 Κάνε	το	[káne	to].		
	
T:	 So	you	could	say,	κάνε	το,	but	also	with	these	short	verbs,	like	we	saw	with,	πάρε	
    [páre],	δείξε	[dhíkse],	you	can	contract	that:	παρ’	το	[pár’to],	δελιξ’	το	[dhíks’to],	
    κάν’	το	[kán’do].	Just,	Do	it!	–	Κάν’	το.		
	
S:	 Κάν’	το.		
	
T:	 But	this	is	only	with	those	little	words	beginning	T	(τ).	So,	I	don’t	know,	if	you	said	
    like,	 Do	 whatever	 you	 want	 with	 me;	 Do	 to	 me	 whatever	 you	 want	 –	 then	 you	
    wouldn’t	join	it.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Κάνε	μου	όποτε	θες	[káne	mu	ópote	thes].		
	
T:	 Whatever	you	want.		
	
S:	 Ό,τι	θες	[óti	thes].	Sorry.		
	
T:	 It’s	a	funny	sentence.	There’s	a	…	there’s	an	odd	…	there’s	an	odd	song	in	Greek	
    that	says	something	like	this:	Πάρε	με	και	κάνε	με	ό,τι	θες	[páre	me	ke	káne	me	
    óti	 thes],	 and	 “με”	 [me],	 not	 “μου”	 [mu],	 actually.	 I	 think	 maybe	 “μου”	 would	
    sound	 something	 like,	 “make	 for	 me”,	 rather	 than,	 “do	 to	 me”.	 And	 how	 would	
    you	say,	Don’t	do	it	–	talking	to	one	person?		
	
S:	 Μην	το	κάνεις	[min	to	kánis].		
	
T:	 Μην	 το	 κάνεις.	 Much	 more	 simple,	 no?	 So	 with	 our	 positive	 orders,	 we’ve	 seen	
    two	common	contractions,	when	we	add	a	small	word	beginning	with	T	(τ).	So,	we	
    go	from,	πάρε	[páre]	to,	πάρ’	το	[pár’to];	from,	κάνε	[káne]	to,	κάν’	το	[kán’do].	
    And	 we’ve	 also	 seen	 that	 the	 “ετε”	 [ete],	 that	 we	 add	 for	 “you”	 (plural),	 can	
    contract	to	“τε”	[te],	and	this	depends	on	the	previous	sound.	We	can	contract	it	
    easily	with	an	S	(σ),	which	is	what	we	tend	to	end	in,	in	our	closed	form	anyway:	
    δείξε,	 δείξτε	 [dhíkse,	 dhíkste];	 παίζω,	 παίξω	 [pézo,	 pékso],	 “I	 play”	 –	 παίξε	
    [pékse],	 Play!	 –	 παίξτε	 [pékste],	 to	 more	 than	 one	 person.	 And	 even	 with	 some	
    common	 verbs,	 we	 can	 find	 this	 “ετε”	 [ete]	 contracted	 after	 sounds	 where	 it	
    might	 not	 usually	 be	 contracted.	 So	 we	 could	 have,	 κάνετε	 [kánete]	 or,	 κάντε	
    [kánde].		
	
	                                  	




                                                                                           479

Teacher:	How	do	you	say,	Take	it	–	to	one	person?		
	
Student:	Πάρ’	το	[pár’to].		
	
T:	 Πάρ’	το.	And	what	if	you	are	talking	to	more	than	one	person?		
	
S:	 Πάρετέ	το	[páreté	to].		
	
T:	 Πάρετέ	 το.	 But	 here,	 most	 commonly,	 you	 would	 hear,	 πάρτε	 το	 [párte	 to],	
    because	the	“ετε”	[ete]	contracts	very	easily	with	the	R	(ρ).	So	you	may	just	have	
    to	listen	out,	especially	with	orders.	We	tend	to	give	the	same	orders	all	the	time,	
    so	you	can	hear,	live,	the	different	versions	that	you	are	most	likely	to	hear.	So,	so	
    far	 we’ve	 been	 using	 the	 closed	 version	 for	 the	 order,	 no?	 But	 this	 may	 not	
    necessarily	always	be	the	case.		
	
	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say	 in	 Greek,	 Such	 things	 are	 things	 like	 this,	 you	 can	 say,	 τέτοια	
    πραγμάτα	[tétia	prághmata].	Τέτοια	πραγμάτα.		
	
S:	 Τέτοια	πραγμάτα.		
	
T:	 So	if	you	say	something	like,	Don’t	show	me	things	like	this,	even	though	you	may	
    be	referring	to	now,	you	might	actually	hear	a	habit	of	just	using	that	open	form.	
    Because	when	you	say	something	like,	Don’t	show	me	these	kind	of	things	(Don’t	
    show	me	things	like	these),	it	has	a	general,	open	feeling,	you	know.	Don’t	show	
    me	things	like	this	–	generally.	So	how	would	you	do	that?	Don’t	show	me	this	kind	
    of	thing.		
	
S:	 Μην	μου	δείχνεις	τέτοια	πραγμάτα	[min	mu	dhíkhnis	tétia	prághmata].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Μην	 μου	 δείχνεις	 τέτοια	 πραγμάτα.	 So	 we	 could	 see	 the	 open	 form,	 the	
    open,	standard	form	of	the	verb,	in	orders	as	well.

S:	 Μην	να	το	φ	...	Ah,	...	μην	το	φάς	[min	to	fas].		
	
T:	 Good.	Just	“μην”.	Μην	το	φάς.	How	would	you	say,	Don’t	eat	this	kind	of	thing?

S:	 Μην	φάς	τέτοια	πραγμάτα	[min	fas	tétia	prághmata].		
	
T:	 Good.	Μην	φάς	τέτοια	πραγμάτα,	is	possible,	but	maybe,	with	“τέτοια	πραγμάτα”	
    you	mean,	you	know,	“this	kind	of	junk	food	–	generally”,	in	which	case	you	might

    “πάτωμα”,	το	πάτωμα,	is	the	floor,	no,	where	you	step.	So	if	you	say,	Don’t	eat	off	
    the	floor,	to	your	child,	or	your	dog,	or	whatever,	you’re	maybe	giving	a	general	
    order.	So,	Don’t	eat	off	the	floor.	Don’t	eat	from	the	floor.	
	
S:	 Μην	τρως	από	το	πάτωμα	[min	tros	apó	to	pátoma].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Μην	 τρως	 από	 το	 πάτωμα.	 Or,	 απ’	 το	 πάτωμα	 [ap’to	 pátoma].	 We	 can	
    contract,	από	το	–	απ’	το	πάτωμα.	So	that’s	how	we	tend	to	make	orders	in	Greek	
    with	 the	 great	 majority	 of	 verbs.	 But	 you	 may	 find	 exceptions,	 like	 those	 verbs	
    ending	“άω”	[áo]	or	“ώ”	[ó],	with	their	accent	on	the	end.	So,	for	example,	how	is,	
    I	speak?		
	
S:	 Μιλάω	[miláo].		
	
T:	 Μιλάω.	So,	for	“Speak!”	you	could	go	from	the	closed	version	–	which	is	what?		
	
S:	 Μιλήσω	[milíso].		
	
T:	 And	say,	Speak!	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Μίλησε	[mílise].		
	
T:	 Good.	Μίλησε.	Speak	to	me.		
	
S:	 Μίλησέ	με	[mílisé	me].		
	
T:	 Very	nice	with	the	accent,	ah.	But	it’s	not	so	much	“με”	[me],	no?	Speak	to	me.		
	
S:	 Μίλησέ	μου	[mílisé	mu].		
	



                                                                                            481
T:	 Μίλησέ	μου.	So	with	our	verbs	with	our	accent	on	the	ending,	we	actually	get	our	
    closed	order,	μίλησε	[mílise],	in	the	same	way	as	with	any	other	verb.	We	take	our	
    closed	 form,	 we	 use	 an	 E	 (ε),	 and	 if	 we	 have	 a	 longer	 verb,	 we	 make	 sure	 our	
    accent	is	third	from	the	end.	Μίλησε.		
	
	 But	our	open,	ongoing	order,	for	verbs	like,	μιλάω,	ρωτάω	[miláo,	rotáo],	that	can	
    end	“άω”	as	well	as	“ώ”	…	for	these	verbs,	instead	of	using	an	E	(ε),	they	use	[a]	
    (α).	So	we	get,	μίλα	[míla].	Μίλα.	And	as	this	is	much	easier	to	say	than,	μίλησε	
    [mílise],	 we	 might	 hear	 this	 more	 often	 than,	 μίλησε.	 Μίλα.	 So	 you	 could	 hear	
    both.	Μίλησε	–	μίλησε	μου	[mílise	mu]	or,	μίλα	μου	[míla	mu].	The	same	with	“I	
    ask”,	for	example.	What	was,	I	ask?		
	
S:	 Ρωτάω	[rotáo].		
	
T:	 Ρωτάω.	Ask	us.		
	
S:	 Ρώτα	μας	[róta	mas].		
	
T:	 Ρώτα	μας.	Νο?	You	could	say,	ρώτα	μας,	like,	μίλα	μας.	Ρώτα	μας.	So	with	verbs	
    like,	 μιλάω,	 ρωτάω	 [miláo,	 rotáo],	 these	 open	 orders	 are	 also	 like	 short	 cuts.	
    They’re	 really	 used	 much	 more,	 even	 when	 we	 don’t	 necessarily	 mean	 an	 open	
    time.	 So,	 μην	 με	 ρώτας	 [min	 me	 rótas]	 or,	 μίλα	 μου	 [míla	 mu].	 But	 generally	
    speaking,	no,	our	open	order	–	an	order	based	on	the	open,	standard	form	of	the	
    verb,	gives	us	an	ongoing,	 open	feeling	 of	an	 ongoing	order.	So	Greek	makes	us	
    think	about	whether	our	orders	are	ongoing,	when	we	say,	Don’t	eat	that	kind	of	
    trash!	Do	we	mean	right	now,	or	generally	speaking?		
	
	 But	 our	 open	 order	 form	 is	 also	 used	 to	 achieve	 another	 feeling.	 So	 this	 open	
    order,	 which	 we	 form	 with	 the	 standard	 version	 of	 the	 verb,	 either	 with	 our	 [e]	
    (ε),	like	we	do	for	most	verbs,	or	with	[a]	(α),	with	our	verbs	ending	“άω”	[áo]	–	
    this	 open	 version	 of	 the	 order,	 no,	 of	 the	 imperative,	 can	 be	 used	 for	 ongoing	
    orders	 or	 ideas	 that	 we	 understand	 as	 ongoing,	 but	 it	 also	 has	 a	 feeling	 of,	 like,	
    “get	going”,	“start	writing”,	you	know,	“start	going”,	“get	going”.	So	you	can	also	
    use	this	open	form	when	you’re	a	bit	impatient,	for	example,	or,	you	know,	if	you	
    want	to	give	the	feeling	of,	“Get	on	with	it!”	Γράφε	[ghráfe]	–	“Get	writing!”	So,	
    we	 can	 also	 use	 the	 open	 orders	 for	 that	 feeling,	 which	 of	 course,	 if	 we	 think	
    about	it,	is	just	another	ongoing	feeling,	no?	Get	writing!	Start	writing!	That’s	an	
    open,	 ongoing	 feeling,	 which	 we’re	 using	 our	 open	 standard	 verb	 form	 for.	 So	
    again,	 this	 is	 something	 we	 want	 to	 listen	 out	 for	 and	 understand	 in	 real	 life,	 in	
    context,	how	this	is	used,	and	the	feeling	associated	with	it	.	How	will	you	say,	Ask	
    me	whatever	you	want?		
	
S:	 Ρώτα	με	ό,τι	θέλεις	[róta	me	óti	thélis].		
	
T:	 Ρώτα	 με	 ό,τι	 θέλεις.	 Good.	 So	 we	 might	 be	 using	 “ρώτα”	 here,	 just	 because	 it’s	
    much	easier	than	“ρώτησε”	[rótise].	We	may	be	using	“ρώτα”,	because	we	mean,	
    you	know,	generally,	Whenever,	you	can	ask	me	whatever	you	like;	that’s	open.	Or	


                                                                                                482
   we	may	be	using	“ρώτα”	here	to	mean	like,	Come	on,	just	…	just	get	on	with	it	and	
   ask	me	what	it	is	that	you	want	to	know.	No?	Like,	Get	asking!	Ρώτα	[róta].	So	this	
   is	why,	whilst	we	talk	about	what’s	going	on	there	in	Greek,	you	really	want	to	just	
   listen	out	and	see	what	people	tend	to	use	in	different	contexts.		
	
	 What	was	the	word	just	for,	what,	rather	than,	whatever?		
	
S:	 Τι	[ti].		
	
T:	 Τι.	And	the	word	for,	never	–	very	similar	to,	when,	just	with	a	change	in	accent.	
    So	we	have,	πότε	[póte]	–	“when”,	and	...	?		
	
S:	 Ποτέ	[poté].		
	
T:	 Ποτέ.	The	word	for	“nothing”,	or	“anything”,	for	“nothing”	or	“anything”	is,	τίποτε	
    [típote]	or	τίποτα	[típota];	you	can	hear	both	in	Greek	–	τίποτε,	τίποτα,	although	
    τίποτα	is	much	more	common.	Τίποτα.		
	
S:	 Τίποτα.		
	
T:	 Don’t	ask	us	anything.	Don’t	ask	us	anything.	
	
S:	 Μην	μας	ρωτήσεις	τίποτα	[min	mas	rotísis	típota].		
	
T:	 Μην	μας	ρωτήσεις	τίποτα.	Or	we	could	just	mean	generally,	no,	an	ongoing	order.	
    How	might	that	be?		
	
S:	 Μην	μας	ρωτάς	τίποτα	[min	mas	rotás	típota].		
	
T:	 Good.	Μην	μας	ρωτάς	τίποτα.	Of	course	we’ll	also	find	other	ways	of	finding	the	
    order.	 For	 example,	 if	 we	 have	 a	 closed	 version	 that’s	 very	 small,	 like,	 πω	 [po],	
    from,	λέω	[léo]	–	“I	say”,	“I	tell”;	like,	δω	[dho]	from,	βλέπω	[vlepo]	–	“I	see”;	we	
    have	a	slightly	different	order.	For,	Tell	me,	we	have,	πες.	Πες	μου	[pez	mu]	–	“tell	
    me”.		
	
S:	 Πες	μου.		
	
T:	 For	“See”,	See,	like	giving	an	order,	we	have,	δες	[dhes].	Δες.		
	
S:	 Δες.		
	
T:	 Maybe	 in	 something	 like,	 Δες	 θεάτρο	 με	 δέκα	 ευρώ	 [dhes	 théatro	 me	 dhéka	
    evró].	What	does	that	mean?	Δες	θεάτρο	με	δέκα	ευρώ.		
	
S:	 Come	and	see	a	theatre	play	for	10	euros.		
	



                                                                                               483
T:	 Yeah,	exactly,	no?	See	theatre	for	10	euros,	or,	“with	10	euros”	in	Greek;	με	δέκα	
    ευρώ	[me	dhéka	evró].	Very	good.		
	
	                             	




                                                                                  484

Teacher:	What	was,	I	go,	or,	I’m	going?		
	
Student:	Πηγαίνω	[piyéno].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνω.	I	was	going?		
	
S:	 Πήγαινα	[píyena].		
	
T:	 Πήγαινα.	And	what	was	the	closed	version	of,	πηγαίνω?		
	
S:	 Πάω	[páo].		
	
T:	 Πάω.	 Good.	 So	 this	 is	 also	 our	 alternative	 form	 of,	 πηγαίνω,	 no	 –	 like,	 the	
    contracted	 form	 that	 can	 mean	 the	 same	 as,	 πηγαίνω,	 but	 it’s	 also	 the	 closed	
    version.	So	we	saw,	πήγαινα	[píyena]	for,	I	was	going.	If	you	want	to	say,	“I	went”,	
    how	do	you	build	that	from,	πάω?	Well	actually,	the	G	(γ)	pops	back	up,	the	“γ”	of	
    πηγαίνω,	that	we	contract	away	in,	πάω,	pops	back	up,	and	we	get,	πήγα	[pígha].	
    Πήγα.	So,	“I	went”	is,	πήγα.		
	
S:	 Πήγα.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	quite	a	strange	past	form,	no?	Πήγα	–	“I	went”.	We	went?		
	
S:	 Πήγαμε	[píghame].		
	
T:	 Πήγαμε.	We	didn’t	go?		
	
S:	 Δεν	πήγαμε	[dhen	píghame].		
	
T:	 Δεν	πήγαμε.	So,	πήγα	[pígha]	is	a	little	bit	like,	πήρα	[píra]	(I	took),	from	παίρνω	
    [pérno];	βρήκα	[vríka]	(I	found)	from,	βρίσκω	[vrísko].	So	we	have	some	odd,	short	
    pasts	with	an	initial	[i]	(η)	sound	in	their	first	syllable:	πήρα,	βρήκα,	πήγα.		
	
	 “Around	about”,	or	“approximately”	is,	περίπου	[perípu].	Περίπου.		
	
S:	 Περίπου.		
	
T:	 So	 we	 have,	 περι	 [peri],	 no,	 then	 που	 [pu]	 –	 περίπου.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 He	
    went	around	5	o’clock?	So	for	“5	o’clock”,	we	will	say	“to	the	5”,	in	the	feminine,	
    because	we	mean,	“to	the	5	hours”;	and	hours	is	feminine:	ώρα,	ώρες	[óra,	óres],	
    feminine.	The	word	for	“5”	is,	πέντε	[pénde],	like	pentagram.	So,	He	went	around	
    5	o’clock	(to	the	5	–	in	the	feminine	plural).		
	
S:	 Πήγα	περίπου	[pígha	perípu]	...		
	


                                                                                          485
T:	 He	went.		
	
S:	 Ah.	Πήγε	περίπου	στις	πέντε	[píye	perípu	stis	pénde].		
	
T:	 Πήγε	περίπου	στις	πέντε.	Very	good.	The	word	for	“ten”	is,	δέκα	[dhéka].	Δέκα.		
	
S:	 Δέκα.		
	
T:	 What	might	we	relate	that	to?	Δέκα?		
	
S:	 Decathlon	–	this	kind	of	sport	where	you	do	ten	…	ten	disciplines.		
	
T:	 Ah	yeah,	I	didn’t	know	that.		
	
S:	 Or	decade.		
	
T:	 So,	 yeah,	 we	 can	 try	 to	 find	 something	 in	 English,	 no,	 and	 we	 do.	 We	 find	
    “decade”,	no,	which	is	ten	years,	even	“December”,	which	is	10,	the	10th	month,	
    well	 it	 used	 to	 be	 when	 our	 calendar	 had	 10	 months.	 I	 mentioned	 that	 October	
    used	 to	 be	 the	 8th	 month	 like,	 οχτώ	 [okhtó].	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 They	 went	
    around	10	o’clock?	They	went	around	10	o’clock.	
	
S:	 Πήγανε	περίπου	στις	δέκα	[píghane	perípu	stis	dhéka].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πήγαν	[píghan]	(or,	πήγανε)	περίπου	στις	δέκα.	Very	good.	How	might	you	
    say,	Don’t	go!	Don’t	go!		
	
S:	 Μην	πας	[min	pas].		
	
T:	 Μην	 πας.	 Very	 good.	 So	 for	 our	 negative	 order,	 no,	 we	 have	 “μην”	 for	 “don’t”.	
    Μην	πας.	But	we	also	use	“μην”	when	“don’t”	comes	after	“να”.	For	example,	we	
    could	say,	I	don’t	want	you	to	go.	No?	How	is	that?	I	don’t	want	...	?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	[dhen	thélo].		
	
T:	 You	to	go.		
	
S:	 Να	πας	[dhen	thélo	na	pas].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	πας	[na	pas].	But	we	could	also	say,	I	want	you	not	to	go.	So	here	we	
    would	put	the	“not”	or	the	“don’t”	after	“να”.	No?	I	want	-	να	-	you	don’t	go.	So	
    here	we	would	use	“μην”,	rather	than	“δεν”.	So	how	would	that	be?	I	want	you	
    not	to	go.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μην	πας	[thélo	na	min	pas].		
	



                                                                                           486
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλω	να	μην	πας.	So	this	is	rather	than,	I	don’t	want	you	to	go.	I	want	
    you	not	to	go.		
	
	 What	was,	I	sell,	like	in	“monopoly”?		
	
S:	 Πουλάω	[puláo].		
	
T:	 Πουλάω.	I	don’t	want	you	to	sell	it	–	let’s	talk	to	one	person.	I	don’t	want	you	to	
    sell	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	το	πουλάς	[dhen	thélo	na	to	pulás].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Δεν	 θέλω	 να	 το	 πουλάς.	 And	 this	 would	 work	 if	 you	 mean	 generally,	 no,	
    which	you	might	if	you’re	saying,	I	don’t	want	you	to	sell	it.	But	if	you’re	referring	
    to	a	specific	event	or	situation,	how	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	το	πουλήσεις	[dhen	thélo	na	to	pulísis].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	το	πουλήσεις.	And	what	if	you	were	to	say,	I	want	you	not	to	sell	it.		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	μην	το	πουλήσεις	[thélo	na	min	to	pulísis].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλω	να	μην	το	πουλήσεις.	So,	it	means	the	same	thing,	no,	but	we	have	a	
    slight	difference	in	feeling	in	Greek,	as	well	as	we	do	in	English.	I	don’t	want	you	to	
    sell	it	–	Δεν	θέλω	να	το	πουήσεις	[dhen	thélo	na	to	pulísis];	I	want	you	not	to	sell	it	
    –	Θέλω	να	μην	το	πουλήσεις	[thélo	na	min	to	pulísis].

Teacher:	Give	me	again,	I	go,	or,	I’m	going.		
	
Student:	Πηγαίνω	[piyéno].		
	
T:	 Πηγαίνω.	So,	πηγαίνω	is,	I	go,	or,	I’m	going,	but	we	can	also	get	the	form,	“going”.	
    This	is,	πηγαίνοντας	[piyénondas].	Πηγαίνοντας.		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνοντας.	
	
T:	 So	 we	 have	 “-οντας”	 [ondas]	 which	 is	 our	 ending	 for	 “-ING”,	 and	 in	 this	 way	 we	
    build	“going”	–	πηγαίνοντας.	This	isn’t	“I’m	going”,	or	“you’re	going”;	just	“going”	
    –	 πηγαίνοντας.	 And	 we	 notice	 that	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 before	 the	 “οντας”.	
    Πγγαίνοντας	[piyénondas].		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνοντας.		
	
T:	 That’s,	O	(ο)	-	N	(ν)	-	T	(τ)	-	A	(α)	-	S	(ς).	So	we	have	the	NT	(ντ)	again	giving	us	ND	
    [nd]	or	D	[d].	How	is,	I	see?		
	
S:	 Βλέπω	[vlépo].		
	
T:	 Βλέπω.	Seeing?		
	
S:	 Βλέποντας	[vlépondas].		
	
T:	 Βλέποντας.	“Television”	is,	τηλεόραση	[tileórasi].	Τηλεόραση.		
	
S:	 Τηλεόραση.		
	
T:	 Do	you	remember	the	meaning	of	“τηλε”	[tile],	like	in,	τηλέφωνο	[tiléfono]?	Τηλ	
    [til].	Τηλέφωνο,	meant	what?		
	
S:	 Um	...	like	the	…	?	
	
T:	 You	remember	what	“φωνο”	[fono]	means?		
	
S:	 “Voice”,	something	like	that.		
	
T:	 “Sound”	or	“voice”.	And	do	you	remember	what	“τηλ”	[til]	meant	then?		
	
S:	 Something	like	distance.		
	
T:	 Yes.		
	
S:	 Distance.		


                                                                                             488
	
T:	 Distance,	 far,	 far	 voice.	 So,	 τηλεόραση	 [tileórasi]	 is	 something	 like	 “far	 vision”	 –	
    something	like	this.	So	that’s	the	television.	So	how	would	you	say,	I	watch	(or,	I’m	
    watching)	television?		
	
S:	 Βλέπω	τηλεόραση	[vlépo	tiliórasi].		
	
T:	 Τηλε	 [tile],	 τηλεόραση	 [tileórasi].	 Βλέπω	 τηλεόραση	 [vlépo	 tileórasi].	 So	 this	 is,	 I	
    watch,	or,	I’m	watching.	No?	Βλέπω	τηλεόραση.	But	if	you	want	to	say	something	
    like,	 I’m	 eating	 popcorn	 watching	 television,	 there	 we	 need	 “watching”,	 no?	
    “Seeing”:	βλέποντας.		
	
	 So	 “popcorn”	 is,	 πόπκορν	 [pópkorn],	 in	 Greek.	 Give	 me	 the	 first	 bit	 –	 I	 eat	 (I’m	
    eating)	popcorn.		
	
S:	 Τρώω	πόπκορν	[tróo	pópkorn].		
	
T:	 Τρώω	πόπκορν	...	watching	television	(seeing	television).		
	
S:	 Βλέποντας	τηλεόραση	[vlépondas	tileórasi].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	maybe	someone	calls	you	and	they	tell	you	like,	“What	are	you	doing?”	
    And	 you	 say,	 Τρώω	 πόπκορν	 βλέποντας	 τηλεόραση	 [tróo	 pópkorn	 vlépondas	
    tileórasi]	 –	 “I’m	 eating	 popcorn	 watching	 television”.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 was	
    eating	 popcorn	 watching	 television?	 So	 we	 have,	 τρώω	 [tróo],	 which	 has	 a	 G	 (γ)	
    swallowed	up	in	it,	which	pops	back	out	when	we	say,	I	was	eating.		
	
S:	 Έτρωγα	[étrogha].		
	
T:	 Έτρωγα.	So,	I	was	eating	popcorn	watching	television.		
	
S:	 Έτρωγα	πόπκορν	βλέποντας	τηλεόραση	[étrogha	pópkorn	vlépondas	tileórasi].		
	
T:	 Έτρωγα	πόπκορν	βλέποντας	τηλεόραση.	Good.	And	it	came	out	more	Greek,	your	
    “popcorn”,	 no,	 which	 is	 natural,	 of	 course,	 when	 you	 are	 in	 the	 tonality	 and	 the	
    rhythm	of	a	language.	It	would	be	more	effort	to	break	it	to	say	“popcorn”	with	a	
    more	native	English	accent,	than	to	put	it	into	your	Greek	accent.	Έτρωγα	πόπκορν	
    βλέποντας	τηλεόραση.	If	you	want	to	say	“eating”	from	“τρώω”,	that	hidden	G	(γ)	
    pops	out	again.	So	how	do	you	think	that	would	be?		
	
S:	 Τρώγοντας	[tróghondas].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Τρώγοντας.	 That’s	 “eating”	 –	 τρώγοντας.	 You	 might	 hear,	 Τρώγοντας	
    έρχεται	η	όρεξη	[tróghondas	érchete	i	óreksi],	which	means,	“eating	(or,	by	eating)	
    comes	 the	 appetite”	 –	 used	 for	 many	 things,	 not	 just	 food,	 no,	 this	 expression.	
    Like,	“You	have	to	get	started	to	want	more.”		
	


                                                                                                489
	 How	would	you	say,	I	saw	him	when	I	was	going	to	the	centre?	I	saw	him	when	I	
    was	going	to	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Τον	είδα	όταν	[ton	ídha	ótan]	...		
	
T:	 I	was	going	…		
	
S:	 Πήγαινα	[píyena]	…		
	
T:	 To	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Στο	κέντρο	[sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Τον	 είδα	 όταν	 πήγαινα	 στο	 κέντρο	 [ton	 ídha	 ótan	 píyena	 sto	 kéndro].	 Now	 we	
    could	 also	 say,	 as	 a	 shortcut,	 “I	 saw	 him	 going	 to	 the	 centre”	 but	 this	 “going”	 is	
    also	like	“by	going”,	or	“whilst	going”.	So	this	doesn’t	…	this	doesn’t	mean,	“I	saw	
    him	and	he	was	going	to	the	centre”,	no.	This	means,	“I	saw	him	–	όταν	πήγαινα	
    [ótan	 píyena]	 (when	 I	 was	 going)	 to	 the	 centre”.	 So	 instead	 of,	 Τον	 είδα	 όταν	
    πήγαινα	 στο	 κέντρο,	 we	 can	 make	a	 shortcut	 and	 say,	 “I	 saw	 him	 going	 (I’m	 the	
    one	that’s	going)	to	the	centre.”	So	how	would	you	do	that?	I	saw	him	going	to	the	
    centre?		
	
S:	 Τον	είδα	πηγαίνοντας	στο	κέντρο	[ton	ídha	piyénondas	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Good.	Τον	είδα	πηγαίνοντας	στο	κέντρο.	“I	saw	him	going	to	the	centre.”	And	this	
    means,	“I	saw	him	when	I	was	going	to	the	centre.”		
	
	 So	“-οντας”	[óndas],	this	“-ING”,	matches	the	person	that’s	in	charge	of	the	verbs,	
    let’s	say,	no.	Εγώ	είδα	[eghó	ídha],	and	then,	πηγαίνοντας	[piyénondas]	can	only	
    refer	to	me.	If	we	want	to	say	something	like,	I	saw	him	going	to	the	centre,	with	
    the	meaning	of:	I	saw	him,	in	the	act	of,	he	was	going,	no,	to	the	centre,	then	we	
    can	 say,	 Τον	 είδα	 να	 πηγαίνει	 [ton	 ídha	 na	 piyéni].	 Τον	 είδα	 –	 “I	 saw	 him”	 –	 να	
    πηγαίνει.	That	[i]	(ει)	of	“πηγαίνει”	refers	back	to	him	–	στο	κέντρο.	So	this	is	how	
    you	would	say,	“I	saw	him	going	on	his	way	to	the	centre.”		
	
	 Do	you	remember	how	to	say,	I	drive?		
	
S:	 Οδηγάω	[odhigháo].		
	
T:	 Οδηγώ	[odhighó],	οδηγάω.	So,	I	saw	her	when	I	was	driving	in	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Την	είδα	όταν	οδηγούσα	στο	κέντρο	[tin	ídha	ótan	odhighúsa	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Την	 είδα	 όταν	 οδηγούσα	 στο	 κέντρο.	 Very	 good.	 So	 with,	 οδηγώ	
    [odhighó],	 we	 have,	 οδηγήσω	 [odhiyíso],	 our	 closed	 version.	 But	 then,	 for	 our	
    open	 past,	 with	 our	 verbs	 with	 our	 accent	 on	 the	 end,	 like	 “οδηγώ”,	 we	 have	



                                                                                                 490
   “ούς”	 [us],	 “ούς”,	 “οδηγούσα”	 [odhighúsa].	 I	 saw	 her	 when	 I	 was	 driving	 in	 the	
   centre	–	Την	είδα	όταν	οδηγούσα	στο	κέντρο.		
	
	 But	we	can	also	make	a	shortcut	for	this,	no?	We	can	say,	I	saw	her	driving	in	the	
    centre,	and	of	course	we	would	mean,	I	saw	her	whilst	I	was	driving	in	the	centre,	
    but	using	“driving”,	no?	How	do	you	think,	driving,	from	“οδηγώ”	might	sound?		
	
S:	 Οδήγωντας	[odhíghondas].		
	
T:	 Οδηγώντας	 [odhighóndas].	 So	 here	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 “ώντας”	 [óndas],	
    because	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 ending	 of,	 οδηγώ	 [odhighó].	 Οδηγώ,	
    οδηγώντας.		
	
S:	 Οδηγώντας	[odhighóndas].		
	
T:	 So,	instead	of,	Την	είδα	όταν	οδηγούσα	στο	κέντρο	[tin	ídha	ótan	odhighúsa	sto	
    kéndro],	we	could	say,	I	saw	her	driving	in	the	centre,	meaning,	when	I	was	driving	
    in	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Την	είδα	οδηγώντας	στο	κέντρο	[tin	ídha	odhighóndas	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Good.	Την	είδα	οδηγώντας	στο	κέντρο.	No?		
	
	 And	 if	 we	 wanted	 to	 say,	 I	 saw	 her	 –	 she	 was	 the	 one	 that	 was	 driving	 in	 the	
    centre,	 rather	 than,	 I	 saw	 her	 whilst	 I	 was	 driving	 in	 the	 centre,	 there	 we	 have	
    quite	 a	 different	 structure,	 no?	 With	 “να”	 and	 just	 the	 present.	 How	 would	 that	
    be?	I	saw	her	driving	in	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Την	είδα	να	οδηγεί	στο	κέντρο	[tin	ídha	na	odhiyí	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Good.	Την	είδα	(I	saw	her)	να	οδηγεί	(referring	back	to	her,	driving)	στο	κέντρο.		
	
	 So	we	don’t	use	this	-ING,	“οντας/ώντας”,	in	all	of	the	places	that	we	would	use	it	
    in	 English.	 And	 it	 refers	 to	 the	 same	 person	 that	 is	 doing	 the	 verbs.	 So,	 Εγώ	 τον	
    είδα	πηγαίνοντας	[eghó	ton	ídha	piyénondas],	the	“πηγαίνοντας”	can	only	refer	to	
    “εγώ”	not	to	“τον”.		
	
	                                    	




                                                                                                491
Complete	Greek,	Track	102	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	So	if	you	are	male,	and	have	a	Greek	name,	like	me,	but	mostly	speak	with	
    non-Greek	speakers,	then	people	are	constantly	calling	you	wrong.	People	call	me	
    Michalis	(Μιχάλης	[mikhális]),	but	really	it	should	be	Michali,	when	they	call	me.	
	
	 So	we’ve	seen	a	lot	about	 case,	no,	how	some	words	can	change,	depending	on	
    how	 they	 are	 behaving	 –	 whether	 they	 are	 acting	 like	 “he”,	 “him”	 or	 “to	 him”;	
    whether	 they	 are	 behaving	 like	 “she”,	 “her”	 or	 “to	 her”.	 Αnd	 all	 of	 this	 is	 called	
    case.	 But	 in	 Greek,	 there’s	 also	 something	 called	 a	 vocative	 case.	 This	 means	 a	
    version	of	the	noun	or	adjective	you	use	to	call	someone.	And	this	is	only	for	the	
    masculine	singular.	So	this	is	quite	specific,	no,	what	Greek	does	here	–	a	case	for	
    calling	 somebody.	 But	 it’s	 very	 difficult	 to	 forget	 about,	 because	 when	 someone	
    calls	 Μιχάλης,	 you	 hear	 “Μιχάλη”	 [mikháli];	 when	 someone	 calls	 Γρηγόρης	
    [ghrighóris],	 you	 will	 hear	 “Γρηγόρη”	 [ghrighóri].	 And	 we	 know	 that	 masculine	
    names	end	in	S	(-ς),	so	we	will	be	reminded	of	this	often	when	we	hear	the	names	
    without	the	S	(-ς).		
	
	 We	have	something	like	this	vocative	in	English	too	–	like	we	say,	“O	Michael”,	no,	
    for	example.	This	“O”	is	a	vocative;	we	use	it	to	show	we’re	calling	someone.	Or	
    you	might	have	heard	it	even	in	another	language,	without	realising.	Most	people	
    know	 the	 Arabic	 word	 “Habíbi”,	 no,	 meaning	 like,	 “my	 dear”,	 or	 something	 like	
    that;	and	you	may	have	heard,	“ya	habibi”,	“ya	habibi”;	this	“ya”	is	just	a	vocative.	
    So	this	idea	is	not	as	weird	as	it	might	sound;	quite	a	few	languages	do	this.	So,	
    how	would	you	say,	for	example,	My	Grigoris,	calling	Γρηγόρης	[ghrighóris]?		
	
Student:	Γρηγόρη	μου	[ghrighóri	mu].		
	
T:	 Γρηγόρι	μου.	Good.	This	is	very	common:	Γρηγόρη	μου;	Μιχάλη	μου.	And	this	isn’t	
    just	with	names,	no?	You	might	call	someone	any	noun	or	adjective.	For	example,	
    λεβέντης	 [levéndis].	 Λεβέντης	 means	 like,	 how	 would	 you	 translate	 “λεβέντης”?	
    Like	a	good	example	of	a	man,	no?	Somebody	that	might	be	like,	tall	and	strong,	
    and	good	looking	and	smart,	and	nice,	and	combines	all	of	this	–	λεβέντης.	And,	
    you	know,	this	is	often	said	to	somebody,	affectionately.	So,	if	you	call	somebody,	
    λεβέντης,	how	will	it	sound?		
	
S:	 Λεβέντη	[levéndi].		
	
T:	 Λεβέντη.	Λεβέντη	μου	[levéndi	mu].	If	the	word	ends	OS	(-ος),	we	don’t	just	drop	
    the	S	(-ς),	we	replace	[os]	with	an	[e],	with	an	E	(ε).	So	for	example,	what	was	the	
    word	for,	friend?		
	
S:	 Φίλος	[fílos].		
	
T:	 Φίλος.	Good.	And	if	you	call	somebody,	Friend.		
	
S:	 Φίλε	[fíle].		


                                                                                                492
	
T:	 Φίλε.	So	this	isn’t	saying,	“You	are	my	friend”,	you	know.	If	you	say,	You	are	my	
    friend,	you	will	say	...	?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	ο	φίλος	μου	[íse	o	fílos	mu].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	ο	φίλος	μου.	This	is	when	you	use	the	word	“friend”,	to	call	somebody.	Φίλε.	
    Or,	My	friend.		
	
S:	 Φίλε	μου	[fíle	mu].		
	
T:	 Φίλε	μου.	You	remember	the	word	for,	big,	like	“mega”?		
	
S:	 Μεγάλος	[meghálos].		
	
T:	 Μεγάλος.	And	if	you	were	to	call	somebody,	Big?	How	might	it	be?		
	
S:	 Μεγάλε	[meghále].		
	
T:	 Μεγάλε.	So	you	might	do	this	actually,	you	know.	You	might	say	like,	“I	agree,	big	
    guy,	 I	 agree”,	 meaning	 like,	 you	 know,	 “What	 you	 said	 is	 great”	 –	 Μεγάλε	
    συμφωνώ	[meghále	simfonó].	Ψηλός	[psilós],	ψηλός,	means	“tall”.	Ψηλός.		
	
S:	 Ψηλὀς.		
	
T:	 So	 you	 might	 call	 somebody	 like	 “tall-y”	 or	 something,	 you	 know.	 Or,	 you	 know,	
    “giant”,	or	something	like	this.	How	would	it	be,	from,	ψηλὀς?		
	
S:	 Ψηλέ	[psilé].		
	
T:	 Ψηλέ.	My	giant.		
	
S:	 Ψηλέ	μου	[psilé	mu].		
	
T:	 Ψηλέ	μου.	The	word	for	“beautiful”	in	Greek	is,	όμορφος	[ómorfos].	Όμορφος.		
	
S:	 Όμορφος.		
	
T:	 This	 is	 like	 in	 metamorphosis.	 Μορφος	 [morfos]	 means	 like	 “form”,	 form;	 a	
    metamorphosis	 is	 your	 after-form.	 And,	 όμορφος,	 “beautiful”,	 means	 something	
    like,	well-formed.	So	if	you	say	to	a	guy,	You	are	beautiful,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	όμορφος	[íse	ómorfos].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	όμορφος.	But	if	you	call	him,	like,	Hey,	beautiful,	how	would	it	be?		
	
S:	 Όμορφε	[ómorfe].		


                                                                                           493
	
T:	 Όμορφε.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	My	beautiful?		
	
S:	 Όμορφέ	μου	[ómorfé	mu].		
	
T:	 Good.	You	came	back	up	on	the	E	(έ).		
	
S:	 Yeah.		
	
T:	 Όμορφέ	 μου	 [ómorfé	 mu].	 Bravo.	 So	 we	 have	 the	 double	 accent	 there,	 no,	
    because	we	have	“μου”	[mu].	We	have	the	accent	on	O	(ό),	όμορφε	–	third	from	
    the	end:	όμορφε.	So	when	we	put	“μου”,	we	come	up	again	on	the	end	–	όμοργέ	
    μου	[ómorfé	mu].	Very	good.		
	
	 So	this	special	vocative	form,	we	only	have	it	for	the	masculine	singular,	no?	If	we	
    say	to	a	girl	or	a	woman,	for	example,	“beautiful”,	we	will	just	use	the	feminine.	So	
    how	would	that	be?	
	
S:	 Όμορφη	[ómorfi].		
	
T:	 Good.	And,	My	beautiful?		
	
S:	 Όμορφή	μου	[ómorfí	mu].		
	
T:	 Όμορφή	μου.	Do	you	remember	the	word	for,	brother?		
	
S:	 Αδελφός	[adhelfós].		
	
T:	 Αδελφός.	 And	 we	 said	 we	 will	 also	 hear,	 very	 commonly,	 αδερφός	 [adherfós].	
    Αδερφός.	And	if	you	call,	Brother.		
	
S:	 Αδελφέ	[adhelfé].		
	
T:	 Αδελφέ.	Good.	Αδελφέ	μου	[adhelfé	mu]	–	“My	brother”.	What	if	you	call	to	your	
    sister?		
	
S:	 Αδελφή	μου	[adhelfí	mu].		
	
T:	 Αδελφή	μου.	Notice	we	just	use	the	…	the	feminine.	And	what	if	you	call	to	your	
    two	sisters?		
	
S:	 Αδελφές	[adhelfés].	Αδελφές	μου	[adhelféz	mu].		
	
T:	 Αδελφές	μου.	And	to	your	two	brothers?		
	
S:	 Αδελφοί	μου	[adhelfí	mu].		
	


                                                                                     494
T:	 Αδελφοί	μου.	Again	[i],	no,	but	spelt	OI	(οί).	So	for	this	vocative,	we	remove	the	S	
    (ς)	or,	if	we	have	OS	(ος),	we	remove	that	and	we	put	an	E	(ε).	But	with	our	male	
    names	 ending	 OS	 (ος),	 we	 might	 use	 the	 E	 (ε),	 or	 we	 might	 just	 drop	 the	 S	 (ς);	
    when	 it	 comes	 to	 names,	 they	 behave	 a	 tiny	 bit	 differently.	 So,	 for	 example,	
    Γιώργος	[yórghos],	if	you	call	“Γιώργος”,	you	would	just	drop	the	S	(ς).		
	
S:	 Γιώργο	[yórgho].		
	
T:	 Γιώργο.	The	name	“Mario”	in	Greek	is	...	?	Well,	I	think	you	can	guess	how	would	
    you	make	“Mario”	Greek.		
	
S:	 Μάριος	[mários].		
	
T:	 Μάριος,	 no?	 You	 just	 put	 the	 S	 (ς)	 for	 the	 masculine.	 Now	 if	 you	 call	 “Μάριος”,	
    this	OS	(ος)	is	going	to	become	an	E	(ε).		
	
S:	 Μάριε	[márie].		
	
T:	 Μάριε.	 Μάριε.	 So	 Greek	 speakers	 can	 hear	 quite	 a	 few	 versions	 of	 their	 own	
    names,	if	you	think	about	it.	We	could	have,	for	example,	Marios	is	waiting.	How	
    would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Ο	Μάριος	περιμένει	[o	mários	periméni].		
	
T:	 Ο	 Μάριος	 περιμένει.	 We	 could	 have,	 I’m	 waiting	 for	 (or,	 I’m	 awaiting)	 Marios.	
    How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	τον	Μάριο	[periméno	ton	mário].		
	
T:	 Περιμένω	 τον	 Μάριο.	 So	 here	 we	 don’t	 have	 “Μάριος”	 [mários],	 but	 “Μάριο”	
    [mário].	How	would	you	say,	I	am	waiting	for	the	friend	of	Marios	(I’m	waiting	for	
    Marios’s	friend)?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	τον	φίλο	του	Μάριου	[periméno	ton	fílo	tu	máriu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Περιμένω	 τον	 φίλο	 του	 Μάριου.	 So	 we’ve	 seen	 Μάριος,	 Μάριο,	
    Μάριου.	 Maybe	 you	 know	 two	 Marioses,	 two	 guys	 called	 Marios,	 and	 you	 call	
    them,	you	know,	the	Marioses,	and	you	might	say	something	like,	you	know,	I’m	
    waiting	for	the	friends	of	the	Marioses.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Περιμένω	τους	φίλους	τους	Μάριους	[periméno	tus	fílus	tus	márius].		
	
T:	 So,	if	we	were	to	say,	for	example,	Περιμένω	τους	φίλους	τους	[periméno	tus	fílus	
    tus]	–	“their	friends”	–	that	would	be	fine.	But	if	we’re	saying,	“the	friends	of	the	
    teachers”,	“the	friends	of	the	Marioses”,	we	don’t	use	“τους”	[tus],	no?	We	have	a	
    change.	So	give	that	another	try.	I’m	waiting	for	the	friends	of	the	Marioses.		
	


                                                                                               495
S:	 Περιμένω	τους	φίλους	των	Μάριων	[periméno	tus	fílus	ton	márion].		
	
T:	 Good.	Περιμένω	τους	φίλους	των	Μάριων.	And	this,	των	[ton],	and	the	[on]	(-ων)	
    of,	 Μάριων,	 both	 with	 the	 ωμέγα	 [omégha]	 (ω),	 the	 [o]	 that	 looks	 like	 a	 “w”.	
    Good.	And	then	we	could	say,	for	example,	Marios.	Wait	here.	How	would	we	do	
    that?		
	
S:	 Μάριε.	Περίμενε	εδώ	[márie.	perímene	edhó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μάριε.	Περίμενε	εδώ.	So	we’ve	seen	two	uses	of	[e]	(ε)	actually,	no,	to	
    make	 our	 orders:	 περίμενε	 [perímene],	 and	 also	 to	 call	 somebody	 –	 or	 to	 call	 a	
    male,	no,	to	be	more	specific.	And	if	you	think	about	it,	to	call	somebody	is	a	little	
    bit	 like	 an	 order,	 no?	 You	 call	 them	 to	 get	 their	 attention.	 Μάριε	 [márie].	 Ψηλέ	
    μου	[psilé	mu].	Φίλε	μου	[fíle	mu].		
	
	 So	your	name	is	quite	a	flexible	concept	in	Greek,	no?	You	can	hear	many	versions	
    of	it:	Μάριε,	Μάριος,	Μάριου,	Μάριο	[márie,	mários,	máriu,	mário].	So	this	isn’t	
    just	about	addressing	males,	this	vocative	feature,	but	also	about	using	masculine	
    words.	You	might	address	a	male	using	a	feminine	word,	too.	For	example,	if	you	
    say,	My	love.	Do	you	remember	how	that	was?		
	
S:	 Αγάπη	μου	[aghápi	mu].		
	
T:	 Αγάπη	μου.	This	is	a	noun,	and	it’s	feminine.	There’s	no	masculine	version,	so	just	
    “αγάπη	μου”,	no?	Even	though	we’re	speaking	to	a	male,	we’re	calling	“my	love”,	
    and	 the	 word	 “love”	 is	 feminine.	 Or,	 for	 example,	 “soul”,	 we	 saw	 was,	 ψυχή	
    [psichí],	like	in	“psychology”.	So	if	you	say,	My	soul?		
	
S:	 Ψυχή	μου	[psichí	mu].		
	
T:	 Ψυχή	 μου.	 No?	 You	 don’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about	 changing	 that.	 And	 I	 couldn’t	
    possibly	talk	about	this	vocative	question	without	mentioning	the	most	frequent	
    of	 vocatives,	 μαλάκα	 [maláka].	 Μαλάκας	 is	 a	 crude	 word	 meaning,	 “a	 not	 very	
    nice	 person”,	 let’s	 say.	 I	 don’t	 have	 to	 go	 into	 the	 logistics	 of	 it.	 But	 like	 many	
    crude	 words,	 it	 can	 jump	 the	 line	 into	 mainstream	 culture	 between	 familiars,	
    between	friends.	So	friends	in	Greek	often	call	each	other	“μαλάκα”,	emphatically	
    in	conversation	–	to	put	a	point,	to	get	someone’s	attention,	to	say	something	like,	
    Έλα	μαλάκα	[éla	maláka]	–	“Come	on,	what	are	you	talking	about”.	Τι	λες;	[ti	les?].	
    Some	people	say	it	all	the	time,	others	rarely,	and	then	others	can’t	stand	it	at	all.	
    So	don’t	throw	it	around	too	much.	And	like	I	said,	it’s	something	you	should	use	
    only	with	people	you’re	familiar	with.	Unless	you	are	having	a	fight,	of	course;	you	
    can	throw	it	around	as	much	as	you	like.	But	there	we	see	the	word	is	“μαλάκας”	
    [malákas],	 but	 of	 course	 when	 you	 call	 somebody,	 you	 don’t	 have	 the	 S	 (ς).	 So	
    that’s	the	most	frequent	vocative	you	will	hear	in	Greek.

Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	house?		
	
Student:	Σπίτι	[spíti].		
	
T:	 Σπίτι,	which	is	actually	related	to	“hospital”	and	“hospitality”.	Σπίτι.		
	
	 To	say	“little	house”,	you	can	change	the	ending	of	“σπίτι”	to	“σπιτάκι”	[spitáki];	
    so	putting	ΑΚΙ	(άκι)	[áki]	–	“little	house”.		
	
S:	 Σπιτάκι	[spitáki].		
	
T:	 So	this	means	“a	little	house”,	in	the	sense	of	a	physically	small	house,	or	just,	kind	
    of	like,	to	make	it	cuter,	you	know,	like	as	you	can	do	in	English:	“I	love	your	little	
    house”,	no?	It	might	not	necessarily	be	small;	it	might	just	be	endearing.	How	is	
    the	word	for,	houses?		
	
S:	 Σπίτια	[spítia].		
	
T:	 Σπίτια.	So	how	might,	little	houses,	be?		
	
S:	 Σπιτάκια	[spitákia].		
	
T:	 Σπιτάκια.	How	is,	the	friend	–	a	feminine	friend?		
	
S:	 Η	φίλη	[i	fíli].		
	
T:	 Η	φίλη.	Το	φιλί	[to	filí],	το	φιλί,	is	“the	kiss”,	the	kiss.	Το	φιλί.		
	
S:	 Το	φιλί.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	a	little	kiss?		
	
S:	 Φιλάκι	[filáki].		
	
T:	 Φιλάκι.	How	would	you	say,	little	kisses?		
	
S:	 Φιλάκια	[filákia].		
	
T:	 And	 this	 is	 used	 on	 males,	 “φιλάκια”,	 and	 also	 said,	 as	 well,	 when	 you’re	 saying	
    goodbye	–	maybe	somebody	says,	Φιλάκια	–	“little	kisses”.		
	
	 “The	water”	was,	το	νερό	[to	neró].	Το	νερό	–	“the	water”.		
	
S:	 Το	νερό.		
	


                                                                                              497
T:	 So	you	may	notice	that	with	certain	words,	it’s	very	common	to	use	this	“άκι”	[áki]	
    ending,	like	for	example,	with	“water”.	You	know,	maybe	you	would	say,	Do	you	
    want	a	little	water?	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Θες	νεράκι;	[thes	neráki?].		
	
T:	 Θες	 νεράκι;	 So	 this	 may	 mean,	 a	 little	 water,	 or	 it	 just	 may	 mean	 when	 people	
    refer	 to	 water,	 they	 use	 this	 cute	 ending,	 no?	 Because,	 you	 know,	 really	 if	 we	
    wanted	to	say	“little”,	we	would	say	there’s	“λίγο”	[lígho],	no?	There’s,	λιγο	νερό	
    [lígho	neró].	So	with	some	words,	you	might	find	it’s	used	quite	often,	like	with,	
    νερό	–	νεράκι.		
	
	 So	“ακι”	is	mostly	used	with	neuter	nouns,	but	not	always.	For	example,	we	could	
    have,	η	γάτα	[i		gháta]	–	“the	cat”.	And	then	the	“little	cat”	is,	γατάκι	[ghatáki];	but	
    “the	 little	 cat”	 is,	 το	 γατάκι	 [to	 ghatáki].	 So	 if	 we	 use	 “άκι”	 for	 a	 word	 that	 isn’t	
    neuter,	we	make	it	neuter:	η	γάτα	–	το	γατάκι.		
	
	 But	for	masculine	nouns,	we	have	“άκης”	[ákis].	What	was	“George”	in	Greek?		
	
S:	 Γιώργος.		
	
T:	 Γιώργος.	Little	George?		
	
S:	 Γιωργάκης	[yorghákis].		
	
T:	 Γιωργάκης.		And	how	would	you	call	him,	little	George,	and	you’re	calling	to	him?		
	
S:	 Γιωργάκη	[yorgháki].		
	
T:	 Γιωργάκη.	 We	 have	 my	 name,	 no,	 Μιχάλης	 [mikhális].	 And	 how	 would	 you	 say	
    like,	little	Μιχάλης?		
	
S:	 Μιχαλάκη	[mikhaláki].		
	
T:	 Again?		
	
S:	 Μιχαλάκης	[mikhalákis].		
	
T:	 Good.	Μιχαλάκης.	And	if	you	were	calling,	little	Michael?		
	
S:	 Μιχαλάκη	[mikhaláki].		
	
T:	 Μιχαλάκη.	 So	 we	 have	 “άκι”	 [áki]	 with	 neuter,	 “άκης”	 [ákis]	 with	 masculine,	 to	
    achieve	this	meaning	of	“little”	something.		
	
For	feminine	nouns	we	could	have,	ούλα	[úla],	ούλα.		
	


                                                                                                     498
S:	 Ούλα.		
	
T:	 Καρδιά	[kardhiá],	καρδιά	–	maybe	you	can	guess	what	“καρδιά”	means;	it	relates	
    to	something	in	English.		
	
S:	 Cardiac,	like,	cardiac	arrest.	Heart.		
	
T:	 “Heart”	–	καρδιά.	My	heart.	Imagine	you	are	calling	somebody,	My	heart.		
	
S:	 Καρδιά.	Καρδιά	μου	[kardhiá	mu].		
	
T:	 Καρδιά	 μου.	 And	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 My	 little	 heart?	 So,	 we	 will	 take	 away	 the	
    ending	“ια”	[ia]		(both	the	I	(ι)	and	the	A	(α)	off	of,	καρδιά),	and	we	will	add,	ούλα	
    [úla],	to	get	“little	heart”.	So	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Καρδούλα	[kardhúla].		
	
T:	 Καρδούλα.	My	little	heart?		
	
S:	 Καρδούλα	μου	[kardhúla	mu].		
	
T:	 Καρδούλα	 μου.	 So,	 καρδούλα	 μου,	 you	 know,	 you	 could	 say	 it	 to	 a	 male	 or	 a	
    female.	 Just	 the	 word	 is	 feminine,	 which	 also	 means	 we	 have	 no	 change	 in	 the	
    vocative,	no,	when	we	use	it	to	call	somebody.	Καρδιά	μου.	Καρδούλα	μου.		
	
	 Κώστας	[kóstas]	is	another	common	name	in	Greek.	Κώστας.		
	
S:	 Κώστας.		
	
T:	 Which	 is	 also	 like,	 the	 same	 name	 as,	 Κωνσταντίνος	 [konstandínos];	 it’s	 like	 a	
    shortened	 version.	 You	 will	 find	 in	 Greek	 sometimes	 you	 have	 a	 few	 versions	 of	
    the	same	name,	actually.	So,	Κώστας.	How	would	you	say,	little	Costas?		
	
S:	 Κωστάκης	[kostákis].		
	
T:	 Κωστάκης.	How	would	you	say,	My	little	Costas,	calling	to	him?		
	
S:	 Κωστάκη	μου	[kostáki	mu].		
	
T:	 Κωστάκη	μου.	How	would	you	say,	This	is	for	little	Costas?		
	
S:	 Αυτό	είναι	για	τον	Κωστάκη.		
	
T:	 Αυτό	είναι	για	τον	Κωστάκη.	Very	good.	So	“άκι”	[áki]	and	“ούλα”	[úla]	aren’t	the	
    only	 endings,	 actually,	 that	 we	 can	 use	 to	 give	 this	 affectionate	 feel.	 You	 might	
    hear	 “ούλη”	 [úli];	 you	 might	 hear	 “ίτσα”	 [ítsa],	 and	 others.	 And	 you	 may	 also	



                                                                                              499
   notice	that	different	regions	have	different	preferences	for	the	one	that	they	go	to	
   automatically.		
	
	 And	in	addition	to	all	of	these	various	sounds	you	might	hear	to	make	something	
  smaller	 or	 cuter,	 there	 are	 other	 sounds	 that	 make	 things	 big	 and	 great.	 So,	 for	
  example,	 you	 could	 hear	 “γυναίκα”	 [yinéka],	 no,	 meaning	 “woman”,	 and	 then	
  “γυναικάρα”	 [yinekára],	 meaning	 like,	 a	 “great	 woman”.	 So	 there	 “άρα”	 [ára]	 is	
  giving	us	the	meaning	of	“big”	or	“great”.	So	listen	out	for	these	in	context,	and	
  also	notice	how	some	words	tend	to	prefer	certain	endings.	We	won’t	use	any	of	
  our	possible	endings	for	all	words.	So	you	will	pick	them	up	in	context.	And	also	
  this	 emphatic-ness	 of	 being	 cuter	 or	 smaller,	 or	 big	 and	 great,	 is	 often	 shown	 in	
  the	voice	as	well,	and	that	will	help	us	pick	it	out	when	we’re	practising	Greek.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	start,	in	Greek?		
	
Student:	Αρχίζω	[archízo].		
	
T:	 Αρχίζω.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Αρχίσω	[archíso].		
	
T:	 Αρχίσω.	How	would	you	say,	She	started	to	speak?	She	started	to	speak.		
	
S:	 Άρχισε	να	μιλήσει	[árchise	na	milísi].		
	
T:	 Why	“μιλήσει”?		
	
S:	 Well	 actually,	 in	 this	 case,	 it’s	 probably	 more	 fitting	 to	 say,	 να	 μιλάει	 [na	 milái],	
    because	it’s	probably	something	she’s	going	to	keep	doing.	Right?		
	
T:	 For	sure,	no?	The	starting	–	She	started;	well,	that	is	a	moment	in	time,	no,	and	
    you	used,	άρχισε	[árchise].	But,	“the	speaking”,	no,	is	…	is	an	ongoing,	it’s	going	to	
    go	 on.	 So,	 Άρχισε	 να	 μιλάει	 [árchise	 na	 milái].	 So	 we	 don’t	 want	 to	 get	 too	
    automatic,	no,	going	to	”μιλήσει”	[milísi]	after	“να”	[na].	We	want	to	think	about	
    it,	 and	 also	 constantly	 listen	 to	 hear	 when	 native	 speakers	 maybe	 choose	 a	
    different	form	to	the	one	we	would.	How	would	you	say,	She’s	starting	to	speak	
    now?	She’s	starting	to	speak	now.	
	
S:	 Αρχίζει	να	μιλάει	τώρα	[archízi	na	milái	tóra].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αρχίζει	να	μιλάει	τώρα.		
	
	 So	 now	 that	 we’ve	 seen	 about	 case,	 no,	 about	 how	 nouns	 change	 in	 different	
    functions,	 I	 can	 talk	 more	 about	 the	 word	 “τώρα”	 [tóra],	 which	 is	 probably,	 την	
    ώρα	 [tin	 óra]	 –	 “the	 hour”,	 contracted	 together	 to	 form	 the	 word	 “τώρα”,	 for	
    “now”.	 And	 of	 course	 we	 have	 this	 in	 the	 “her”	 form,	 because	 it’s	 like,	 “on	 the	
    hour	 –	 on	 her”,	 rather	 than	 “on	 she”,	 no?	 So,	 τώρα	 –	 την	 ώρα,	 much	 like	 the	
    Spanish,	ahora,	also	meaning	“to	the	hour”,	or	something	like	that.		
	
	 “It’s	raining”,	It’s	raining	in	Greek	is,	βρέχει	[vréchi].	Βρέχει.

T:	 Very	good.	Έμαθα	να	οδιγάω.	Έμαθα	να	οδιγώ	[ématha	na	odhighó].	So	here	we	
    left	it	open,	no?	I	learnt	–	that’s	closed	–	έμαθα	[ématha],	to	drive	–	well	this	is	an	
    ongoing,	open	thing.	Έμαθα	να	οδιγώ.		
	
	 So	we	have	“οδιγώ”	-	“I	drive”,	and	“I	explain”	was	...	?	So,	οδιγώ,	is	something	like	
    “to	lead	on	the	roads”,	something	like	this;	and	“to	explain”	is	something	like,	“to

S:	 Εξιγήζω	[eksiyízo].		
	
T:	 Ok;	 that’s	 a	 version	 that	 came	 to	 your	 head,	 no?	 But,	 you	 want	 to	 know	 what

T:	 Ακούω.	So	for,	“I	wasn’t	listening”	we	have	this	open	past,	no,	–	I	wasn’t	listening.	
    How	would	you	say,	I	listened?	What	is	the	closed	version?

T:	 Ακούσω.	I	listened.		
	
S:	 Άκουσα	[ákusa].		
	
T:	 Άκουσα.	 “I	 was	 listening”	 is,	 άκουγα	 [ákugha].	 Άκουγα.	 So	 we	 have	 a	 [gh]	 (γ)	
    popping	up,	that’s	been	swallowed	away	in,	ακούω.	And	we	also	have	the	accent

T:	 So,	I	wasn’t	listening?		
	
S:	 Δεν	άκουγα	[dhen	ákugha].		
	
T:	 Αλλά	δεν	άκουγα	[alá	dhen	ákugha].	Good.	So,	He	started	to	explain	it	to	me	but	I	
    wasn’t	 listening.	 Άρχησε	 να	 μου	 το	 εξήγει	 αλλά	 δεν	 άκουγα	 [árchise	 na	 mu	 to	
    eksiyí	alá	dhen	ákugha]	...	and	so	he	left.	And	so	…	,	or	just,	So	he	left.	For	this	“so”,	
    no,	we	can	say,	και	έτσι	[ke	étsi],	which	means,	literally,	“and	like	this”	–	και	έτσι.	
    We	can	say,	και	για	αυτό	[ke	ya	aftó]	–	“and	because	of”	or,	“and	for	this”	...	“and	
    because	 of	 this	 (και	 για	 αυτό)	 he	 left”.	 So,	 “I	 leave”	 is,	 φεύγω	 [févgho],	 and	 the	
    closed	version	is,	φύγω	[fígho].	So	how	would	you	say,	And	so	he	left?		
	
S:	 Και	έτσι	έφυγε	[ke	étsi	éfiye].		
	
T:	 Good.	Και	έτσι	έφυγε.	Άρχησε	να	μου	το	εξήγει	αλλά	δεν	άκουγα	και	έτσι	έφυγε	
    [árchise	na	mu	to	eksiyí	alá	dhen	ákugha	ke	étsi	éfiye].	Or	…	και	για	αυτό	έφυγε

	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 He	 wants	 me	 to	 work	 at	 the	 school	 because	 he	 heard	 me

S:	 Θέλει	να	δουλέψω	[théli	na	dhulépso].		
	
T:	 Θέλει	 να	 δουλέψω.	 He	 wants	 me	 to	 work	 at	 the	 school.	 So	 the	 “school”	 was,

    So,	He	wants	that	I	work	at	the	school.		
	
S:	 Θέλει	να	δουλέψω	στο	σχολείο	[théli	na	dhulépso	sto	skholío].

T:	 Γιατί	 (επειδή	 [epidhí])	 ...	 he	 heard	 me	 teaching.	 So,	 διδάσκω	 [dhidhásko]	 is	 “I

S:	 Με	άκουσε	να	διδάξω	[me	ákuse	na	dhidhákso].		
	
T:	 Almost,	uh.	Με	άκουσε	–	that’s	good	–	He	heard	me,	no?	Με	άκουσε	…	teaching.	
    Why	did	you	go	to	the	closed	version	form	of	the	verb?		
	
S:	 Because,	I	thought	he	was	just	listening	to	me	teach	for	a	closed	period	of	time.		
	
T:	 So,	 Με	 άκουσε	 [me	 ákuse]	 –	 He	 heard	 me,	 that’s	 closed	 …	 να	 διδάσκω	 [na	
    dhidhásko]	 –	 He	 heard	 me	 teaching.	 He	 heard	 me	 doing	 something	 open	 and	
    ongoing,	no?	Με	άκουσε	να	διδάσκω	…	He	heard	me	teaching	and	he	liked	it.		
	
S:	 Με	άκουσε	να	διδάσκω	και	τον	άρεσε	...	και	του	άρεσε	[me	ákuse	να	dhidhásko	
    ke	ton	árese	…	ke	tu	árese].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλει	να	δουλέψω	στο	σχολέιο	επειδή	με	άκουσε	να	διδάσκω	και	του	
    άρεσε	[théli	na	dhulépso	sto	skholío	epidhí	me	ákuse	na	dhidhásko	ke	tu	árese].	
    So	 here	 we	 had	 -ING,	 no,	 “he	 heard	 me	 teaching”;	 but	 that	 -ING	 was	 different	
    from	the	person	that	is	doing	the	main	verb:	με	άκουσε	να	διδάσκω.	If	we	were	to	
    say,	 με	 άκουσε	 διδάσκοντας	 [me	 ákuse	 dhidháskondas],	 if	 we	 were	 to	 use	 that	
    “ING”,	it	would	mean	something	completely	different	–	He	heard	me	whilst	he	was	
    teaching;	He	heard	me	when	he	was	teaching.

Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	where?		
	
Student:	Πού	[pu].		
	
T:	 Πού.	And	we	also	said	that	we	can	use	this	like,	“that”,	when	“that”	is	like	“which”,	
    no?	So,	for	example,	if	you	say,	The	book	that	you	bought.	How	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Το	βιβλίο	που	αγόρασες	[to	vivlío	pu	aghórases].		
	
T:	 Το	 βιβλίο	 που	 αγόρασες.	 Very	 good.	 But	 we	 also	 have	 a	 more,	 another	 more	
    complicated	 way	 of	 doing	 this,	 but	 we	 may	 have	 a	 preference	 for	 using	 that	 in	
    certain	situations.	Mostly	you	can	just	use	“που”,	but	there	also	exists,	ο	οποίος	[o	
    opíos].	So,	for	example,	you	could	say,	Το	βιβλίο	το	οποίο	αγόρασες	[to	vivlío	to	
    opío	aghórases],	and	it	means	the	same	as,	Το	βιβλίο	που	αγόρασες	[to	vivlío	pu	
    aghórases].	It’s	more	like,	“Τhe	book	the	which	you	bought”	–	Το	βιβλίο	το	οποίο	
    αγόρασες.	And	you	can	see	that,	το	βιβλίο,	and,	το	οποίο,	are	matching.		
	
	 What	was,	I	live,	like	in	“zoo”?		
	
S:	 Ζω	[zo].		
	
T:	 Ζω.	And	the	word	for,	woman,	like	in	“misogyny”?		
	
S:	 Γυναίκα	[yinéka].		
	
T:	 Good.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 The	 women	 that	 live	 there?	 Let’s	 do	 the	 easy	 option	
    first	with	“που”.	The	women	that	live	there.	The	women	who	live	there.		
	
S:	 Οι	γυναίκες	που	ζούν	εκεί	[i	yinékes	pu	zun	ekí].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Οι	 γυναίκες	 που	 ζούν	 εκεί	 (που	 ζούνε	 εκεί	 [pu	 zúne	 ekí]).	 And	 like	 I	 said,	
    instead	of	που	[pu],	you	can	use,	ο	οποίος	[o	opíos].	But	you’re	going	to	match	“ο	
    οποίος”	to	“οι	γυναίκες”.	So	how	would	that	be?	The	women	who	live	there.		
	
S:	 Οι	γυναίκες	οι	οποίες	ζούν	εκεί	[i	yinékes	i	opíes	zun	ekí].		
	
T:	 Good.	Οι	γυναίκες	οι	οποίες	ζούν	εκεί.	Good.	What	was,	I	know?		
	
S:	 Ξέρω	[kséro].		
	
T:	 Ξέρω.	So,	ξέρω,	is	our	general	verb	for	“know”,	and	we	can	use	it	to	know	people	
    as	 well.	 But	 especially	 with	 talking	 about	 people,	 you	 may	 also	 hear,	 γνωρίζω	
    [gnorízo].	Γνωρίζω.		
	
S:	 Γνωρίζω.		


                                                                                               505
	
T:	 Γνωρίζω,	for	“I	know”,	like	in	“cognitive”	–	that’s	connected,	no?	And	you	can	also	
    use,	 γνορίζω,	 like	 “to	 meet”.	 So,	 for	 example,	 you	 could	 say,	 “The	 man	 that	 you	
    met”.	What	might	be	the	closed	form	of,	γνορίζω?		
	
S:	 Γνορίσω	[gnoríso].		
	
T:	 Γνορίσω.	How	would	you	say,	The	man	that	you	met?		
	
S:	 Ο	άνδρας	που	γνόρισες	[o	ándras	pu	gnórises].		
	
T:	 Good.	Ο	άνδρας	που	γνόρισες.	So	that’s	the	simpler	form,	no?	But	you	could	also	
    use,	ο	οποίος,	and	do	it	like	that.	So	how	would	that	be?	The	man	the	which	you	
    met.	
	
S:	 Ο	άνδρας	ο	οποίος	γνόρισες	[o	ándras	o	opíos	gnórises].		
	
T:	 Good.	 But	 unlike	 “The	 women	 that	 live	 there	 (who	 live	 there)”,	 behaving	 like	
    “they”,	no	–	“they	live	there”	–	this	is,	“The	man	that	(who)	I	met”.	So	here	it’s	not	
    behaving	like	“he”,	no?	“I	met	him”,	rather	than	“he”.		
	
S:	 Ο	άνδρας	τον	οποίον	γνόρισες	[o	ándras	ton	opíon	gnórises].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Very	 good.	 Ο	 άνδρας	 τον	 οποίον	 –	 you	 said,	 which	 was	 really	 well	
    thought	out.	You	decided	that	it	behaves	more	like	the	words	for	“the”,	than	just	
    any	old	noun	or	adjective,	no?	But	like	I	said,	that’s	kind	of	falling	out	of	use,	and	
    there	 are	 some	 changes	 happening	 to	 Greek.	 So,	 for	 example,	 you	 know,	 you	
    could	hear,	O	άνδρας	τον	οποίον	[o	ándras	ton	opíon]	–	either	“the	man	I	saw”,	or,	
    O	άνδρας	τον	οποίο	[o	ándras	ton	opío].	Either.	We	could	also	say,	το	άτoμο	[to	
    átomo].	Το	άτoμο,	which	is	gender-free.	That	can	be	a	man	or	a	woman:	το	άτομο	
    –	the	atom,	the	person.	So	how	would	you	say,	The	people	that	you	met?		
	
S:	 Οι	άτομοι	[i	átomi]	…		
	
T:	 So,	το	άτομο	–	what	gender	is	it?		
	
S:	 Ah	...	Τα	άτομα	τα	οποία	γνόρισες	[ta	átoma	ta	opía	gnórises].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Τα	 άτομα	 τα	 οποία	 γνόρισες.	 Or	 just,	 που	 [pu]	 –	 Τα	 άτομα	 που	
    γνόρισες	[ta	átoma	pu	gnórises].	Also,	if	you	want	to	say	something	a	little	more	
    complicated	like,	“This	is	the	girl	who	I	spoke	to”,	“This	is	the	friend	I	saw	going	to	
    the	 centre”,	 you	 may	 have	 a	 preference	 for	 “ο	 οποίος”	 over	 “που”	 in	 some	
    situations,	 to	 make	 it	 clearer	 what	 you’re	 saying.	 So,	 for	 example,	 I	 went,	 from	
    πηγαίνω	[piyéno]	–	it	was	a	little	like,	πήρα	[píra],	“I	took”,	like,	βρήκα	[vríka],	“I	
    found”.	How	is,	I	went?		
	
S:	 Πήγα	[pígha].		


                                                                                             506
	
T:	 Πήγα.	So	if	you	want	to	say	something	like,	“Is	this	the	friend	you	went	with?”,	we	
    will	say,	“This	is	the	friend	with	the	which	you	went”.	So	how	would	that	be?	First	
    bit	is,	This	is	the	friend	–	and	let’s	talk	about	the	masculine	friend.		
	
S:	 Αυτός	είναι	ο	φίλος	[aftós	íne	o	fílos].		
	
T:	 Good.	 Αυτός	 είναι	 ο	 φίλος	 ...	 with	 the	 who	 you	 went.	 So	 we	 will	 use	 “ο	 οποίος”	
    here,	no,	but	we	do	need	to	think	about	what	it’s	doing	and	how	it	will	behave.	So,	
    With	the	who	you	went.		
	
S:	 Με	…	με	τον	οποίο	πήγες	[me	ton	opío	píyes].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτός	είναι	ο	φίλος	με	τον	οποίο	πήγες	[aftós	íne	o	fílos	me	ton	opío	píyes].	
    And	 you	 could	 also	 say,	 Με	 τον	 οποίο	 πήγατε	 [me	 ton	 opío	 píghate].	 So,	 Υou	
    (plural)	went.	So	you	can	include	the	other	person,	no,	even	if	you’re	not	referring	
    to	you	and	somebody	else	going	with	that	person	–	only	if	you	mean	you	and	that	
    one	other	person,	no?	You	can	say,	“Is	that	the	friend	with	who	you	guys	went?”,	
    even	though	you	just	mean	“you	two”.	That’s	quite	a	common	habit	in,	in	Greek,	
    you	 know.	 You	 can	 hear,	 for	 example,	 Μιλάμε	 με	 τον	 Γιώργο	 [miláme	 me	 ton	
    yórgho],	and	it	just	means,	“I’m	talking	with	Giorgo”,	but	you	include	both	of	you	
    in	the	verb	–	Μιλάμε	με	τον	Γιώργο.		
	
	 So,	we	could	have,	Αυτός	είναι	ο	φίλος	με	τον	οποίο	πήγες	(πήγατε)	[aftós	íne	o	
    fílos	me	ton	opío	píyes	(píghate)].	Or	maybe	you	want	to	add	the	word,	μαζί	[mazí]	
    –	 που	 πήγατε	 μαζί	 [pu	 píghate	 mazí].	 Μαζί	 means	 “together”.	 So,	 “This	 is	 the	
    friend	that	you	guys	went	together”	–	Αυτός	είναι	ο	φίλος	που	πήγατε	μαζί.	Are	
    these	the	friends	you	went	with?	–	still	masculine	or	mixed	friends.	Are	these	the	
    friends	you	went	with?		
	
S:	 Αυτόι	είναι	οι	φίλοι	που	πήγατε	μαζί;	[aftí	íne	i	fíli	pu	píghate	mazí?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτόι	είναι	οι	φίλοι	που	πήγατε	μαζί;	Or,	if	you	wanted	to	use,	ο	οποίος,	
    how	would	that	be?	Are	these	the	friends	that	you	went	with?		
	
S:	 Αυτόι	 είναι	 οι	 φίλοι	 με	 τους	 οποίους	 πήγατε	 εκεί;	 [aftí	 íne	 i	 fíli	 me	 tus	 opíus	
    píghate	ekí?].	
	
T:	 Okay.	 You	 added	 “there”	 (εκεί),	 but	 that’s	 fine.	 Αυτόι	 είναι	 οι	 φίλοι	 με	 τους	
    οποίους	πήγες	[aftí	íne	i	fíli	me	tus	opíus	píyes]	(or,	πήγατε	[píghate]).	Αυτόι	είναι	
    οι	φίλοι	με	τους	οποίους	πήγες	εκεί	(πήγατε	εκεί).		
	
	 These	are	the	friends	I	saw	going	to	the	centre.	These	are	the	friends	I	saw	going	to	
    the	centre.	So	if	we	want	to	say	something	like	this,	first	we	need	to	really	know	
    what	 we	 mean.	 Do	 we	 mean,	 “When	 I	 was	 going”,	 or	 “When	 they	 were	 going”?	
    “These	 are	 the	 friends	 I	 saw	 when	 I	 was	 going	 to	 the	 centre”,	 or	 “These	 are	 the	
    friends	that	I	saw	and	they	were	going	to	the	centre”?	So	let’s	do	the	first	one	first.	


                                                                                               507
   We’re	going	to	say,	These	are	the	friends	I	saw	going	to	the	centre,	and	we	mean	
   when	I	was	going.	So	the	first	bit	is,	These	are	the	friends.		
	
S:	 Αυτόι	είναι	οι	φίλοι	[aftí	íne	i	fíli].		
	
T:	 That	I	saw.		
	
S:	 Τους	οποίους	είδα	[tus	opíus	ídha].		
	
T:	 Good.	Or	just,	που	είδα	[pu	ídha],	no?	We	could	have	either.	Αυτόι	είναι	οι	φίλοι	
    τους	οποίους	είδα	[aftí	íne	i	fíli	tus	opíus	ídha],	or	just,	που	είδα	…	going	to	the	
    centre.	So	here	we	mean,	“I	was	going	to	the	centre”,	no,	“Whilst	I	was	going	to	
    the	centre”.		
	
S:	 Πηγαίνοντας	στο	κέντρο	[piyénondas	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Good.	Αυτόι	είναι	οι	φίλοι	τους	οποίους	είδα	πηγαίνοντας	στο	κέντρο	[aftí	íne	i	fíli	
    tus	opíus	ídha	piyénondas	sto	kéndro].	So	it’s	not	that	“πηγαίνοντας”	only	works	
    for	 “I”;	 no?	 Ιt’s	 that	 it	 matches	 whoever	 is	 in	 charge	 of	 the	 main	 verb,	 which	 is	
    “είδα”,	 no	 –	 “I	 saw”.	 So	 it	 matches	 whoever	 that	 verb	 refers	 to,	 automatically.	
    Αυτόι	 είναι	 οι	 φίλοι	 τους	 οποίους	 (or	 just,	 που)	 είδα	 πηγαίνοντας	 (when	 I	 was	
    going)	στο	κέντρο	(to	the	centre).		
	
	 But	the	same	sentence	in	English	may	mean,	“These	are	the	friends	I	saw	going	to	
    the	 centre”,	 like,	 “They	 were	 going	 to	 the	 centre”.	 In	 Greek,	 we	 show	 this	 in	 a	
    different	way.	So	let’s	try	that.	These	are	the	friends	I	saw.		
	
S:	 Αυτόι	είναι	οι	φίλοι	που	είδα	[aftí	íne	i	fíli	pu	ídha].		
	
T:	 Going	to	the	centre	–	and	we	mean,	“they	were	going”.		
	
S:	 Nα	πηγαίνουν	στο	κέντρο	[na	piyénun	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Αυτόι	 είναι	 οι	 φίλοι	 που	 είδα	 να	 πηγαίνουν	 στο	 κέντρο	 [aftí	 íne	 i	 fíli	 pu	 ídha	 na	
    piyénun	sto	kéndro].	We’re	using	the	open,	ongoing	form	of	the	verb	to	give	us:	
    “-ing”	 –	 στο	 κέντρο.	 Αυτόι	 είναι	 οι	 φίλοι	 τους	 οποίους	 (or	 just,	 που)	 είδα	 να	
    πηγαίνουν	στο	κέντρο.		
	
	 “The	girl”,	the	girl,	is,	η	κοπέλα	[i	kopéla].	H	κοπέλα.		
	
S:	 Η	κοπέλα.		
	
T:	 Have	you	seen	the	girl	who	we	went	to	the	centre	with?		So	Have	you	seen	the	girl?		
	
S:	 Έχεις	δει	την	κοπέλα;	[échis	dhi	tin	kopéla?].		
	
T:	 Έχεις	δει	την	κοπέλα	...	with	the	which	we	went	to	the	centre?		


                                                                                                508
	
S:	 Με	την	οποία	πήγαμε	στο	κέντρο	[me	tin	opía	píghame	sto	kéndro].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Έχεις	 δει	 την	 κοπέλα	 με	 την	 οποία	 πήγαμε	 στο	 κέντρο;	 [échis	 dhi	 tin	
    kopéla	me	tin	opía	píghame	sto	kéndro?].		
	
	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 The	 man	 we	 explained	 it	 to?	 The	 man	 to	 the	 which	 we	
    explained	it	–	using	the	word	for	“to”	(σε	[se]).		
	
S:	 Ο	άνδρας	στον	οποίο	το	εξηγήσαμε	[o	ándras	ston	opío	to	eksiyísame].		
	
T:	 Good.	The	man	we	explained	it	to.	The	man	to	the	which	we	explained	it.	Ο	άνδρας	
    στον	οποίο	το	εξηγήσαμε.	We	could	also	just	say,	O	άνδρας	που	του	το	εξηγήσαμε	
    [o	 ándras	 pu	 tu	 to	 eksiyísame]	 –	 The	 man	 that	 to	 him	 it	 we	 explained.	 No?	 Ο	
    άνδρας	που	του	το	εξηγήσαμε.		
	
	 I	 mentioned	 briefly	 the	 word,	 μαζί	 [mazí],	 which	 means	 ”together”	 or	 “together	
    with”,	 and	 it’s	 actually	 quite	 common	 in	 Greek	 ,	 this	 word,	 μαζί.	 You	 will	 hear	 it	
    thrown	around	a	lot.	If	you	say,	“together	with	me”,	you	will	say,	Μαζί	μου	[mazí	
    mu].	So	we	use	“μου”	like,	as	if	it	were	“to	me”,	“with	me”,	no	–	“together	with	
    me”,	“together	to	me”:	Μαζί	μου.		
	
S:	 Μαζί	μου.		
	
T:	 Together	with	you?		
	
S:	 Μαζί	σου	[mazí	su].		
	
T:	 Μαζί	σου.	How	would	you	say,	I	want	to	go	with	you?	I	want	to	go	together	with	
    you.	
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	πάω	μαζί	σου	[thélo	na	páo	mazí	su].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θέλω	να	πάω	μαζί	σου.	How	would	you	say,	The	man	we	met	wants	to	go	
    to	the	party	together	with	you?	So,	The	man	we	met.		
	
S:	 Ο	άνδρας	που	τον	γνωρής	...	γνωρήσαμε	[o	ándras	pu	ton	gnorís	…	gnorísame].		
	
T:	 So	 when	 you	 use	 “που”,	 things	 stay	 quite	 simple.	 Ο	 άνδρας	 που	 γνωρήσαμε	 [o	
    ándras	pu	gnorísame].	No?	But	when	we	use	“ο	οποίος”	–	and	that’s	why	we	think	
    about	it	as	“ο	οποίος”	–	then	you	have	two	different	bits	to	think	about:	“ο”	and	
    “οποίος”.	 Ο	 άνδρας	 τον	 οποίο	 γνωρήσαμε	 [o	 ándras	 ton	 opío	 gnorísame].	 But	
    with	“που”,	it’s	very	simple:	O	άνδρας	που	γνωρήσαμε	…	in	the	centre.		
	
S:	 Στο	κέντρο	[sto	kéndro].		
	



                                                                                                509
T:	 Στο	κέντρο	...	wants	to	go	to	the	party	with	you.	“The	party”	is,	το	πάρτι	[to	párti].	
    Wants	to	go	to	the	party	together	with	you.		
	
S:	 Θέλει	να	πάει	στο	πάρτι	μαζί	σου	[théli	na	pái	sto	párti	mazí	su].

Teacher:	“I	come”	or,	“I’m	coming”	in	Greek	is,	έρχομαι	[érkhome].	Έρχομαι.

    it’s	not	ending	O	(ω)	[o].	Έρχομαι.	So	what’s	going	on	in,	έρχομαι	–	“I	come”?		
	
	 I	mentioned,	briefly,	a	while	back,	that,	in	the	Cypriot	dialect,	a	lot	of	the	time	we	
    have	the	words	like	“me”	–	με,	σε,	τον	–	after	the	verb.	So,	instead	of,	μου	αρέσει	
    [mu	 arési]	 –	 Αρέσκει	 μου	 [aréski	 mu].	 This	 habit	 actually	 comes	 from	 ancient	
    Greek,	 and	 some	 verbs,	 built	 a	 long	 time	 ago,	 seem	 to	 be	 doing	 this	 very	 same	
    thing.	They	were	built	in	this	way.	So,	έρχομαι	[érkhome],	although	one	word,	is	
    probably	something	like,	έρχω	με	[érkho	me].	Something	like,	“I	come	myself”,	or	
    maybe,	 “I	 bring	 myself”,	 only	 the	 “με”	 is	 coming	 afterwards,	 as	 it	 used	 to	 be	 in	
    Greek,	when	this	vocabulary	would	have	been	formed.		
	
	 So	 we	 actually	 have	 O	 (ω)	 [o],	 έρχω	 [érkho],	 for	 “I”,	 and	 then,	 με	 [me].	 No?	
    Έρχομαι	[érkhome]	–	“I	come”.	And	the	[me]	is	actually	spelt,	M-A-I	(μαι)	[me];	the	
    AI	(αι)	there	together	gives	us	the	[e]	sound.	Έρχομαι.		
	
S:	 Έρχομαι.		
	
T:	 I’m	not	coming.		
	
S:	 Δεν	έρχομαι	[dhen	érkhome].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 έρχομαι.	 “You	 come”,	 you	 come,	 you	 are	 coming,	 is,	 έρχεσαι	 [érchese].	
    Έρχεσαι.		
	
S:	 Έρχεσαι.		
	
T:	 This	is	like	E-R-X-E-S-A-I.	So	again,	we	have	the	AI	(αι)	giving	us	the	[e]	sound,	like	
    in,	έρχομαι,	like	in,	και	[ke],	the	word	for	“and”.	Aren’t	you	coming?		
	
S:	 Δεν	έρχεσαι;	[dhen	érchese?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	έρχεσαι.	Why	don’t	you	come	tomorrow?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	δεν	έρχεσαι	αύριο;	[yatí	dhen	érchese	ávrio?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Γιατί	δεν	έρχεσαι	αύριο;		
	
	 Another	verb	like	this	is	“I	think”,	I	think	–	σκέφτομαι	[skéftome].		
	
S:	 Σκέφτομαι.		


                                                                                               511
	
T:	 “I	think”	then,	is	literally	something	like,	you	know,	“I	think	myself”.	So	again	we	
    have	the	“-ομαι”	ending.	Σκέφτομαι	also	means	“to	think	about”.	So,	I’m	thinking	
    about	my	friend.	How	would	you	say	that?	Let’s	say	a	masculine	friend.		
	
S:	 Σκέφτομαι	τον	φίλο	μου	[skéftome	ton	fílo	mu].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτομαι	τον	φίλο	μου.	And	a	female	friend?		
	
S:	 Σκέφτομαι	την	φίλη	μου	[skéftome	tin	fíli	mu].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτομαι	την	φίλη	μου.	Σκέφτομαι,	is	of	course	related	to	“sceptical”,	no?	So	a	
    sceptical	person	is	just	a	thinking	person;	it’s	got	a	really	bad	name	for	them.	So	
    we	saw,	έρχομαι	[érkhome]	–	“I	come”	and,	έρχεσαι	[érchese]	–	“you	come”.	So	
    how	would	you	say,	You	think?		
	
S:	 Σκέφτεσαι	[skéftese].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτεσαι.	What	do	you	think?		
	
S:	 Τι	σκέφτεσαι;	[ti	skéftese?].		
	
T:	 Τι	 σκέφτεσαι;	 “A	 thought”	 so	 like	 the	 noun,	 no,	 “a	 thought”	 is,	 μία	 σκέψη	 [mia	
    sképsi].		
	
S:	 Μία	σκέψη.		
	
T:	 You	 may	 hear,	 Μετά	 από	 …	 μετά	 από	 σκέψη	 [metá	 apó	 sképsi]	 –	 “after	 much	
    consideration”,	or,	μετά	από	πολλή	σκέψη	[metá	apó	polí	sképsi].	And	the	plural	
    of,	σκέψη	–	what	do	you	think	it	might	be,	the	word	for,	thoughts?		
	
S:	 Τα	σκέψια	[ta	sképsia].	No	wait.		
	
T:	 It’s,	Μία	σκέψη,	η	σκέψη,	so	it’s	feminine.		
	
S:	 Um.		
	
T:	 And	then,	what’s	the	next	thing	you	do?	I	mean,	where	would	you	look?		
	
S:	 Um,	to	the	ending.		
	
T:	 Yeah,	 but,	 when	 you	 want	 to	 decide	 how	 that	 ending	 goes	 into	 plural,	 where	
    would	you	look?		
	
S:	 At	another	word	that	I	know,	like,	γυναίκα	–	γυναίκες	[yinéka,	yinékes].		
	
T:	 But	it	doesn’t	end	like,	σκέψη	[sképsi].		


                                                                                            512
	
S:	 True.	
	
T:	 You	could	look	at,	πόλη	[póli],	the	word	for	city.	And	what	was	the	plural	of	that?		
	
S:	 Πόλεις	[pólis].		
	
T:	 Πόλεις.	 No?	 So	 we	 will	 have	 an	 intuition,	 something	 that	 feels	 right,	 and	 that	
    might	 just	 be	 really	 random,	 and	 it	 might	 be	 from	 something	 that	 we’ve	 heard,	
    no?	 So	 we	 also	 want	 to	 consciously	 look	 for	 other	 words	 that	 might	 share	 the	
    pattern.	So,	μία	σκέψη	[mía	sképsi],	and	then	“thoughts”	–	σκέψεις	[sképsis];	just	
    like,	πόλη,	and	then	“cities”	–	πόλεις.		
	
	 So	these	verbs,	έρχομαι,	σκέφτομαι,	were	historically	built,	or	thought	of,	in	this	
    way,	 no?	 But	 we	 can	 also	 build	 verbs	 in	 this	 way	 to	 achieve	 some	 alternative	
    meanings.	So,	for	example,	I	find,	was	...	?		
	
S:	 Βρίσκω	[vrísko].		
	
T:	 Βρίσκω.	“I	find	myself”,	“I	am	found”	–	like	in	a	place	–	is,	βρίσκομαι	[vrískome].		
	
S:	 Βρίσκομαι.		
	
T:	 So	 we	 can	 also	 do	 that	 ourselves,	 no?	 We	 can	 change	 “βρίσκω”	 to	 “βρίσκομαι”,	
    and	we	get	a	new	meaning:	“I	find	myself”	or,	you	know,	“I	am	in	a	place”,	“I	am	
    found	in	a	place”.	So,	you	might	say,	for	example,	I	find	myself	in	Athens.	“Athens”	
    is	Αθήνα	[athína].	So	how	would	you	say,	I	find	myself	in	Athens?		
	
S:	 Βρίσκομαι	στην	Αθήνα	[vrískome	stin	athína].		
	
T:	 Βρίσκομαι	 στην	 Αθήνα.	 So	 we	 can	 get	 a	 slightly	 different	 meaning	 using	 [ome]	
    (ομαι),	no,	instead	of	[o]	(ω);	βρίσκομαι,	instead	of,	βρίσκω.	If	you	think	about	it,	
    “ομαι”,	 other	 than	 sounding	 like	 [o]	 and	 [me],	 also	 sounds	 and	 looks	 like,	 είμαι	
    [íme]	–	“I	am”.	No?	Είμαι	[íme]	is	spelt	E-I-M-A-I,	and	you	have	that	AI	(αι)	on	the	
    end	giving	us	the	[e]	sound,	as	you	do	in	“ομαι”	[ome].	The	same	with	the	“εσαι”	
    [ese]	ending	–	βρίσκεσαι	[vrískese];	“εσαι”	also	looks	and	sounds	a	lot	like	“είσαι”	
    [íse]	–	“you	are”.		
	
	 So	 we	 can	 get	 new	 meanings	 from	 the	 concepts	 of,	 you	 know,	 something	 like	
    “myself”	or	“I	am”,	“I	find	myself”,	“I	am	found”.	So	we	saw,	βρίσκομαι	–	“I	find	
    myself”;	βρίσκομαι	στην	Αθήνα	–	“I	find	myself	in	Athens”.		How	would	you	say,	
    Where	 do	 you	 find	 yourself?	 –	 just	 a	 …	 quite	 a	 common	 way	 in	 Greek	 of	 asking,	
    “Where	are	you?”,	“Where	do	you	find	yourself?”	or,	“Where	are	you	living	at	the	
    moment?”		
	
S:	 Πού	βρίσκεσαι;	[pu	vrískese?].		
	


                                                                                             513
T:	 Που	βρίσκεσαι;		
	
	 “I	lose”,	is,	χάνω	[kháno].	Χάνω.		
	
S:	 Χάνω.		
	
T:	 I	lose	myself?	So,	I	get	lost	–	I	lose	myself,	would	be,	I	get	lost,	in	English.		
	
S:	 Χάνομαι	[khánome].		
	
T:	 Χάνομαι.	The	word	for	“easy”,	the	masculine,	was,	εύκολος	[éfkolos].	Εύκολος.		
	
S:	 Εύκολος.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	get	lost	easily	here?		
	
S:	 Χάνομαι	 εδώ	 εύκολο	 [khánome	 edhó	 éfkolo].	 Ah,	 no,	 wait!	 “Easily”.	 Χάνομαι	
    εύκολα	…	[khánome	éfkola].		
	
T:	 Εύκολα	[éfkola].	Good	for	“-ly”,	no?	“Easily”.	We	have	the	[a]	(α)	ending	–	εύκολα.	
    Χάνομαι	εύκολα	...	here?		
	
S:	 Εδώ	[edhó].		
	
T:	 Χάνομαι	εύκολα	εδώ	[khánome	éfkola	edhó].	And,	You	get	lost?		
	
S:	 Χάνεσαι	[khánese].		
	
T:	 Χάνεσαι.	And	just,	You	lose?		
	
S:	 Χάνεις	[khánis].		
	
T:	 Χάνεις.	Νο?		
	
	 So	we	may	find	old	verbs,	very	common	verbs	like,	έρχομαι	[érkhome],	no,	that	in	
    our	 modern	 Greek	 are	 not	 coming	 from	 anything	 else.	 Έρχομαι	 is	 just,	 έρχομαι,	
    no?	But	historically,	it	would	have	been	built	from	another	verb.	And	we	can	also	
    build	on	verbs	that	we	already	know,	in	this	same	way,	to	get	different	meanings,	
    like:	βρίσκω	[vrísko]	–	“I	find”,	and	then,	βρίσκομαι	[vrískome]	–	“I	find	myself”,	“I	
    am	 found”;	 χάνω	 [kháno]	 –	 “I	 lose”,	 χάνομαι	 [khánome]	 –	 “I	 lose	 myself”,	 “I	 get	
    lost”.

Teacher:	So	what	was,	I	come,	in	Greek?		
	
Student:	Έρχομαι	[érkhome].		
	
T:	 Έρχομαι.	And,	You	come?		
	
S:	 Έρχεσαι	[érkhese].		
	
T:	 Έρχεσαι.	So	we	saw	that,	with	this	type	of	verb,	no,	we	have	“ομαι”	[ome]	as	an	
    ending	for	“I”,	like,	είμαι,	like	–	“I	am”,	and	also	spelt	in	a	similar	way,	no:	that	[e]	
    on	the	end	of	“ομαι”	is	AI	(αι).	And	then	we	have	“εσαι”	for	“you”	like,	είσαι,	like	–	
    “you	are”.	Do	you	remember	how	to	say,	I	think,	like	“sceptical”?		
	
S:	 Σκέφτομαι	[skéftome].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτομαι.	And,	You	think?		
	
S:	 Σκέφτεσαι	[skéftese].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτεσαι.	 So	 we	 have	 “ομαι”	 [ome]	 like	 “είμαι”	 [íme];	 “εσαι”	 [ese]	 like	 “είσαι”	
    [íse].	What	was,	We	are?		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	[ímaste].		
	
T:	 Είμαστε.	Good.	We	are	here.		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	εδώ	[ímaste	edhó].		
	
T:	 Είμαστε	εδώ.	For	“We	come	(We’re	coming)”	we	have,	ερχόμαστε	[erkhómaste].	
    Ερχόμαστε.		
	
S:	 Ερχόμαστε.		
	
T:		So,	we	add	“όμαστε”	[ómaste],	and	we	accent,	the	O	[o];	we’re	actually	accenting	
    the	ending	here.	Ερχόμαστε.		
	
S:	 Ερχόμαστε.	
	
T:	 We	don’t	do	that	with,	έρχομαι	[érkhome],	nor,	έρχεσαι	[érkhese],	no	–	accent	the	
    ending.	Ερχόμαστε.	How	do	you	say,	We’re	not	coming	today?		
	
S:	 Δεν	ερχόμαστε	σήμερα	[dhen	erkhómaste	símera].		
	
T:	 Δεν	ερχόμαστε	σήμερα.	We	think?		
	


                                                                                            515
S:	 Σκεφτομάστε	[skeftomáste].		
	
T:	 Σκεφτόμαστε	[skeftómaste].	
	
	 Φαντάζομαι	[fandázome]	–	“I	fantasy	me”,	“I	am	fantasied”.	What	do	you	think	it	
    might	mean		–	φαντάζομαι?		
	
S:	 I	imagine.		
	
T:	 I	 imagine.	 Yes.	 And	 it’s	 used	 quite	 colloquially	 as	 well,	 like	 –	 I	 guess,	 I	 guess	 so.	
    Φαντάζομαι	 –	 I	 imagine	 so.	 You	 can	 say,	 What	 do	 you	 imagine?	 like,	 you	 know,	
    What	do	you	suppose?	What	do	you	think?	What	do	you	imagine?		
	
S:	 Τι	φαντάζεσαι;	[ti	fandázese?].		
	
T:	 Τι	φαντάζεσαι;	And,	φαντάζομαι,	φαντάσεσαι	[fandázome,	fandázese]	is	spelt	NT	
    (ντ),	 no?	 So	 this	 gives	 us	 either	 ND	 [nd]	 or	 D	 [d],	 depending	 on	 the	 dialect	 of	
    Greek,	or	the	age	of	the	person.	D	[d]	is	used	much	more	by	younger	people.	So,	
    you	know,	we	could	hear	[fandázome]	or	[fadázome],	but	not	a	T	sound	[t],	even	
    though	we	have	NT	(ντ)	written	there.	We	imagine?		
	
S:	 Φανταζόμαστε	[fandazómaste].		
	
T:	 Φανταζόμαστε.	Very	good.	What	was	the	word	for,	good,	in	Greek?		
	
S:	 Καλός	[kalós].		
	
T:	 Καλός.	And	in	the	neuter?		
	
S:	 Καλό	[kaló].		
	
T:	 Καλό.	And,	καλώ	[kaló]	is	also	“I	invite”,	or	“I	call”,	no?	But	of	course	spelt	with	the	
    [o]	of	“I”	on	the	end;	so	that’s	with	the	ωμέγα	[omégha]	(ω),	that	looks	like	a	“w”.	
    Καλώ.	 The	 closed	 version	 of,	 καλώ,	 is,	 καλέσω	 [kaléso].	 Καλέσω.	 So,	 instead	 of	
    inserting	 [is]	 here,	 no,	 προσπαθώ	 –	 προσπαθήσω	 [prospathó,	 prospathíso],	 we	
    have	an	[es],	an	ES	(ες):	καλέσω.	Like,	μπορώ	–	μπορέσω	[boró,	boréso].		
	
S:	 Καλέσω.		
	
T:	 Καλεσμένος	[kalezménos]	means	“invited”.	Καλεσμένος.		
	
S:	 Καλεσμένος.		
	
T:	 Good.	 So	 we’ve	 seen	 “-μένος”	 [ménos]	 adjectives	 before,	 no,	 like,	 κουρασμένος	
    [kurazménos]	–	“tired”.	And	these	adjectives	are	connected	to	the	closed	forms	of	
    verbs,	no?	We	have,	καλώ	–	καλέσω	[kaló,	kaléso],	and	then	καλεσμένος	–	invited.	



                                                                                                    516
   How	would	you	say,	We	imagine	that	we	are	not	invited?	We	imagine	that	we’re	
   not	invited.	
	
S:	 Φανταζόμαστε	 ότι	 δεν	 είμαστε	 καλεσμένος	 ...	 καλεσμένοι,	 καλεσμένοι	
    [fandazómaste	óti	dhen	ímaste	kalezménos	…	kalezméni,	kalezméni].		
	
T:	 Good.	Φανταζόμαστε	ότι	δεν	είμαστε	καλεσμένοι	[fandazómaste	óti	dhen	ímaste	
    kalezméni].	Good.	
	
	 We	saw	“σίγουρος”	which	means	“sure”.	And	how	would	you	say,	surely,	or	like,	
    for	sure?	Surely.		
	
S:	 Σίγουρα	[síghura].		
	
T:	 Σίγουρα.	 Surely	 you	 don’t	 imagine	 that	 you’re	 invited.	 How	 would	 you	 say	 that?	
    Let’s	talk	to	a	male.	Surely	you	don’t	imagine	that	you’re	invited.		
	
S:	 Σίγουρα	 δεν	 φαντάζεσαι	 ότι	 είσαι	 καλεσμένος	 [síghura	 dhen	 fandázese	 óti	 íse	
    kalezménos].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Σίγουρα	 δεν	 φαντάζεσαι	 ότι	 είσαι	 καλεσμένος.	 So	 before	 we	 saw,	
    κουρασμένος	[kurazménos],	which	meant	“tired”.		
	
S:	 Κουρασμένος.		
	
T:	 This	 is	 from,	 κουράζω	 [kurázo]	 –	 “I	 tire”.	 Like	 “I	 tire	 him”	 –	 Τον	 κουράζω	 [τον	
    kurázo]	–	I	tire	him.	And	we	could	also	get	from,	κουράζω	(I	tire),	“I	get	tired”	–	
    κουράζομαι	[kurázome].	Κουράζομαι.		
	
S:	 Κουράζομαι.		
	
T:	 So	 we	 have,	 κουράζω	 –	 I	 tire,	 like,	 I	 tire	 somebody	 (somebody	 else);	 and	
    κουράζομαι	–	I	get	tired.	So	how	would	you	say,	Do	you	get	tired?		
	
S:	 Κουράζεσαι;	[kurázese?].		
	
T:	 Κουράζεσαι;	You	could	say,	“No”	–	όχι	[óchi];	or	you	could	say,	καθόλου	[kathólu]	
    –	“Not	at	all”.	And	this	is	often	used	like	“no”:	καθόλου	–	Not	at	all.		
	
S:	 Καθόλου.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	don’t	get	tired	at	all?		
	
S:	 Δεν	κουράζομαι	καθόλου	[dhen	kurázome	kathólu].		
	
T:	 Δεν	κουράζομαι	καθόλου.	How	would	you	say,	I	imagine	that	you	didn’t	like	it	at	
    all?	I	imagine	that	it	didn’t	please	you	at	all.		


                                                                                              517
	
S:	 Φαντάζομαι	 ότι	 δεν	 …	 δεν	 σου	 άρεσε	 καθόλου	 [fandázome	 óti	 dhen	 …	 dhen	 su	
    árese	kathólu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Φαντάζομαι	ότι	δεν	σου	άρεσε	καθόλου	[fandázome	óti	dhen	su	árese	
    kathólu].		
	
	 So	some	verbs	in	Greek	became	like	this	a	long	time	ago	–	when	I	say,	“became	
    like	 this”,	 I	mean	 with	 an	 “ομαι”	[ome]	 or	“εσαι”	 [ese]	 ending.	 And	 these	 words	
    are	fixed,	let’s	say:	έρχομαι,	σκέφτομαι.	But	also,	as	we’ve	seen,	other	verbs	can	
    be	made	like	this,	to	change	a	little	their	meaning.	So	we	have,	κουράζω		“I	tire”,	
    and	 κουράζομαι	 –	 “I	 get	 tired”.	 We	 saw,	 φαντάζομαι	 –	 “I	 imagine”,	 and	 also,	
    φαντάζω	[fandázo]	exists	by	itself.	We	saw	“I	find”.	What	was,	I	find?		
	
S:	 Βρίσκω	[vrísko].		
	
T:	 Βρίσκω.	And,	I	am	found,	like,	you	know,	I	am	at	a	place;	I	am	found	at.		
	
S:	 Βρίσκομαι	[vrískome].		
	
T:	 Βρίσκομαι.	Where	are	you	now?	Where	are	you	found	now?		
	
S:	 Πού	βρίσκεσαι	τώρα;	[pu	vrískese	tóra?].		
	
T:	 Πού	 βρίσκεσαι	 τώρα;	 So	 you	 could	 say	 this	 on	 the	 phone,	 no?	 Πού	 βρίσκεσαι	
    τώρα;	 Like,	 “Where	 are	 you	 now?”	 But	 if	 you	 say	 it	 in	 person,	 Πού	 βρίσκεσαι	
    τώρα;	 –	 It	 might	 mean	 like,	 you	 know,	 “Where	 are	 you	 living	 now?”	 or	 even,	
    “What	are	you	up	to	now?”	How	would	you	say,	We	find	ourselves	in	Athens.		
	
S:	 Βρισκόμαστε	στην	Αθήνα	[vriskómaste	stin	athína].		
	
T:	 Βρισκόμαστε	στην	Αθήνα.		
	
	 So	 with	 some	 verbs,	 we	 have	 both,	 you	 know.	 We	 have,	 βρίσκω	 [vrísko]	 and	
    βρίκομαι	 [vrískome];	 we	 have,	 κουράζω	 [kurázo]	 and,	 κουράζομαι	 [kurázome].	
    But	with	other	verbs	like,	έρχομαι	[érkhome],	σκέφτομαι	[skéftome]	–	they’re	just	
    built	this	way.	And	they	were	built	this	way	a	long	time	ago	from	other	verbs	that	
    don’t	exist	any	more.		
	
	                                  	




                                                                                          518

Teacher:	Θεωρώ	[theoró],	θεωρώ,	means	“I	consider”.	I	consider	–	θεωρώ.		
	
Student:	Θεωρώ.		
	
T:	 Like	 “theory”;	 it’s	 like,	 you	 know	 “I	 theorise”	 –	 θεωρώ.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 We	
    consider?		
	
S:	 Θεωρούμε	[theorúme].		
	
T:	 Θεωρούμε.	“I	am	considered”,	I	am	considered,	is	also	[theorúme]	–	θεωρούμαι.		
	
S:	 Θεωρούμαι.		
	
T:	 So	 you	 will	 find	 that	 those	 verbs	 with	 their	 accent	 on	 the	 end	 like,	 θεωρώ,	 will	
    have	alternative	versions;	instead	of	“-ομαι”	[ome],	we	can	have	“-ούμαι”	[úme],	
    “-άμαι”	[áme],	or	“ιέμαι”	[iéme],	instead	of	our	standard	“ομαι”.		
	
	 So,	 [theorúme]	 (θεωρούμε),	 other	 than	 “We	 consider”,	 is	 also	 “I	 am	 considered	
    (θεωρούμαι).	And	we	have	the	“ούμαι”	[úme]	ending	like	“ομαι”	[ome],	which	of	
    course	means	it’s	spelt	with	AI	(αι)	on	the	end	for	that	[e]	sound	–	the	[theorúme]	
    of	 “I	 am	 considered”	 (θεωρούμαι),	 rather	 than,	 “We	 consider”.	 How	 would	 you	
    say,	I	am	considered	a	good	teacher?	I	am	considered	a	good	teacher.	What	was	
    the	word	for,	teacher?		
	
S:	 Δάσκαλος	[dháskalos].		
	
T:	 Δάσκαλος.	Good.		
	
S:	 Θεωρούμαι	καλός	δάσκαλος	[theorúme	kalós	dháskalos].		
	
T:	 Good.	Θεωρούμαι	καλός	δάσκαλος.	Or,	for	a	female,	Θεωρούμαι	καλή	δασκάλα	
    [theorúme	kalí	dhaskála].	Good.	I	am	considered	a	good	teacher.		
	
	 So,	θεωρούμαι,	other	than	“I	am	considered”,	also	sounds	like,	“We	consider”.	But	
    we	understand	what’s	happening	because,	you	know,	“We	consider	good	teacher”	
    wouldn’t	 make	 any	 sense,	 no?	 So	 whilst	 we	 may	 see	 other	 versions,	 no,	 like	
    “ούμαι”	[úme],	generally	we	have	“ομαι”	[ome],	to	build	this	kind	of	verb	for	“I”.	
    So	how	was,	I	am	coming?		
	
S:	 Έρχομαι	[érkhome].		
	
T:	 Έρχομαι.	So	whilst	we	may	see	other	endings,	like	with	these	verbs	that	have	their	
    accent	on	the	end	(θεωρώ	–	θεωρούμαι	[theoró,	theorúme]),	generally	we	know	
    we	have	“ομαι”	to	build	this	kind	of	verb.	And	what	was	the	ending	for	“you”?	We	
    have	“-ομαι”	for	“I”,	and	for	“you”?		


                                                                                               519
	
S:	 -εσαι	[ese].		
	
T:	 -εσαι.	So,	You’re	coming	(You	come).		
	
S:	 Έρχεσαι.		
	
T:	 Έρχεσαι.	And	the	ending	for,	We?		
	
S:	 -όμαστε	[ómaste].		
	
T:	 -όμαστε.	 Good;	 and	 with	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 [o]	 –	 όμαστε	 [ómaste].	 So,	 We’re	
    coming	(We	come)?		
	
S:	 Ερχόμαστε	[erkhómaste].		
	
T:	 Ερχόμαστε.	Έρχεται	[érchete]	is,	“he	comes/she	comes/it	comes”.	Έρχεται.		
	
S:	 Έρχεται.		
	
T:	 And	 we	 notice,	 no,	 with,	 έρχεσαι,	 έρχεται	 [érchese,	 érchete]	 that	 the	 [kh]	 (χ)	 is	
    softened	by	 that	E	 (ε).	 So	 we	have,	ερχόμαστε,	 έρχομαι	 [erkhómaste,	 érkhome],	
    and	then,	έρχεσαι,	έρχεται	[érchese,	érchete].	So	we	have	the	“εται”	[ete]	ending	
    for	he/she	and	it.	This	is	spelt	like	ET	(ετ),	again	AI	(αι)	on	the	end,	like	the	verb,	
    είναι	[íne].		
	
	 Before,	I	mentioned	the	saying,	Τρωγόντας	έρχεται	η	όρεξη	[tróghondas	érchete	i	
    óreksi]	 –	 “Eating	 comes	 the	 appetite”.	 So	 that	 was	 what	 this	 was:	 Έρχεται	 –	 It	
    comes.	Τρωγόντας	έρχεται	η	όρεξη.		
	
	 How	would	you	say,	Where	is	she	now	(Where	does	she	find	herself	now)?		
	
S:	 Πού	βρίσκεται	τώρα;	[pu	vrískete	tóra?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πού	βρίσκεται	τώρα;	So	the	“εται”	[ete]	ending	actually	sounds	like	the	
    plural	“you”	ending.	No?	It’s	spelt	differently,	but	it	sounds	exactly	the	same.	How	
    do	you	say,	You	(plural)	find?		
	
S:	 Βρίσκετε	[vrískete].		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	Αυτός	(or	αυτή)	βρίσκεται	[aftós	(aftí)	vrískete]	–	He	(or,	she)	is	found,	
    and,	 Εσείς	 βρίσκετε	 [esís	 vrískete]	 –	 You	 guys	 find,	 sounds	 the	 same.	 But,	 Πού	
    βρίσκεται	 [pu	 vrískete],	 like,	 Where	 is	 she,	 you	 know,	 we	 …	 we	 will	 understand	
    what	it	means,	because,	Πού	βρίσκετε	[pu	vrískete]	–	as,	Where	do	you	guys	find,	
    isn’t	 a	 complete	 sentence,	 no?	 So	 if	 somebody	 stops	 there,	 then	 we	 understand	
    what	 it	 means.	 So	 again,	 you’ll	 have	 to	 keep	 an	 open	 mind	 in	 Greek,	 and	 not	



                                                                                              520
   decide	too	quickly	that	one	or	the	other	is	going	on,	you	know;	and	keep	an	open	
   mind	to	the	general,	grander	context.		
	
	 Νοικιάζω	[nikiázo]	means	“I	rent”.	Νοικιάζω.		
	
S:	 Νοικιάζω.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	He	rents	(or,	She	rents,	or,	She	is	renting).		
	
S:	 Νοικιάζει	[nikiázi].		
	
T:	 Νοικιάζει.	You	(plural)	are	renting.	You	guys	are	renting.		
	
S:	 Νοικιάζετε	[nikiázete].		
	
T:	 Νοικιάζετε.	Νοικιάζεται	[nikiázete],	νοικιάζεται,	with	the	ending	spelt	ETAI	(-εται)	
    –	so	the	[e]	on	the	end	with	AI	(αι),	no,	rather	than	“You	guys	are	renting”	–	means	
    “It	rents	itself”,	or	“for	rent”:	For	rent,	like	an	apartment’s	for	rent.	But	if	you	see	
    this	on	a	sign,	you	will	see,	Ενοικιάζεται	[enikiázete],	and	this	is	because,	on	signs,	
    which	are	like,	more	formal,	no,	an	older,	formal	version	of	the	language	is	used.	
    So	some	words	you	see	around,	you	won’t	actually	use	them,	you	know.	So	here	
    we	 have	 a	 small	 difference	 between,	 νοικιάζω	 [nikiázo],	 no,	 and	 ενοικιάζω	
    [enikiázo],	which	is	the	older,	more	formal	version	of	the	verb.		
	
	 The	 same	 goes	 for,	 “For	 sale”.	 If	 you	 see	 that	 on	 a	 sign	 you	 will	 see,	 Πωλείται	
    [políte];	if	someone	says	it,	you	will	hear,	Πουλιέται	[puliéte].	So,	πωλείται	on	the	
    sign	 and,	 πουλιέται	 in	 speech.	 So	 these	 are	 small	 changes,	 no:	 ενοικιάζεται	 –	
    νοικιάζεται;	 πωλείται	 –	 πουλιέται.	 But	 sometimes	 you	 will	 find	 completely	
    different	 words	 being	 used	 on	 signs,	 than	 what	 are	 used	 in	 real	 life.	 So	 pay	
    attention	to	that.	How	would	you	say,	This	house	isn’t	for	rent?	This	house	isn’t	for	
    rent.		
	
S:	 Αυτό	το	σπίτι	δεν	νοικιάζεται	[aftó	to	spíti	dhen	nikiázete].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Αυτό	 το	 σπίτι	 δεν	 νοικιάζεται.	 Δεν	 νοικιάζεται	 αυτό	 το	 σπίτι	 [dhen	
    nikiázete	 aftó	 to	 spíti].	 So,	 again,	 sounding	 the	 same	 as	 “you”	 plural	 meant,	 but	
    spelt	 with	 the	 AI	 (αι)	 ending	 –	 like	 the	 verb,	 είναι.	 Νοικιάζεται.	 So,	 if	 you	 go	
    around	a	Greek	city,	you	are	likely	to	see	this	word	quite	often,	ενοικιάζεται,	on	
    signs.	 But	 when	 we	 speak,	 we	 say,	 νοικιάζεται.	 So	 watch	 out	 for	 some	 of	 those	
    words.

Teacher:	Εννοώ	[enoó],	εννοώ,	means	“I	mean”,	you	know,	like,	when	you	say,	“What	
    do	you	mean?”.	How	would	you	say	that	–	What	do	you	mean?	And,	εννοώ,	has	
    two	O’s	[oó],	and	the	last	is	accented.	Εννοώ	[enoó].		
	
Student:	Τι	εννοείς;	[ti	enoís?].		
	
T:	 Τι	 εννοείς.	 Good.	 So	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 end,	 nο?	 Εννοώ,	 εννοείς	 [enoó,	
    enoís].	Which	means	that	we’re	not	going	to	use	“ετε”	[ete]	for	“you”	plural.	So,	
    how	would	you	say,	What	do	you	guys	mean?		
	
S:	 Τι	εννοείτε;	[ti	enoíte?].		
	
T:	 Τι	 εννοείτε.	 Very	 good.	 Εννοείται	 [enoíte],	 spelt	 with	 ΑΙ	 (αι)	 on	 the	 end	 –	 “It	 is	
    meant”,	 means,	 “of	 course”	 or,	 “for	 sure”.	 So,	 you	 know,	 maybe	 you	 say,	 “Can	 I	
    use	the	bathroom?”	Αnd	somebody	says,	Εννοείται,	like,	“Of	course”.	And	in	many	
    different	contexts	and	circumstances	–	you	could	hear	this.	Εννοείται.		
	
S:	 Εννοείται.		
	
T:	 So	again,	the	same	sound	as	the	plural,	Εσείς	[esís],	no?	Τι	εννοείτε	[ti	enoíte]	–	
    “What	do	you	guys	mean?”;	or	just,	Εννοείται	–	“It	is	meant”,	“Of	course”.		
	
	 Χρειάζομαι	[khriázome],	χρειάζομαι	is	“I	need”.	Χρειάζομαι.		
	
S:	 Χρειάζομαι.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	We	need?		
	
S:	 Χρειαζόμαστε	[khriazómaste].		
	
T:	 Χρειαζόμαστε.	 So	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 ending	 here,	 no?	 Our	 ending	 is	
    “όμαστε”	[ómaste],	and	we	accent	the	beginning	of	it.	Χρειaζόμαστε.	But	we	don’t	
    generally	do	this,	no?	Χρειάζομαι	[khriázome]	–	“I	need”.	You	need?		
	
S:	 Χρειάζεσαι	[khriázese].		
	
T:	 Χρειάζεσαι.	He	needs	(or,	She	needs)?		
	
S:	 Χρειάζεται	[khriázete].		
	
T:	 Χρειάζεται.	
	
	 So	 our	 “-εται”	 [ete]	 ending	 doesn’t	 look	 a	 lot	 like	 “είναι”	 [íne],	 no?	 As	 “-ομαι”	
    [ome]	 looks	 like	 “είμαι”	 [íme],	 and	 “-όμαστε”	 [ómaste]	 looks	 like	 “είμαστε”	
    [ímaste],	 and	 “-εσαι”	 [ese]	 looks	 like	 “είσαι”	 [íse],	 “-εται”	 doesn’t	 look	 so	 much	


                                                                                                522
   like	 “είναι”,	 although	 it	 does	 end	 AI	 (αι),	 like	 “είναι”,	 and	 we	 do	 have	 the	 T	 (τ)	
   present	in	“εται”	like	the	T	(τ)	from	“την”	[tin]	and	“τον”	[ton]	and	“το”	[to],	nο?	So	
   we	 can	 make	 some	 connections	 there	 for	 “-εται”	 –	 why	 we	 have	 “-εται”:	
   χρειάζεται	[khriázete]	–	“He	needs,	She	needs”.	What	does	he	need?		
	
S:	 Τι	χριεάζεται;	[ti	khriázete?].		
	
T:	 Τι	χριεάζεται.	So	we	have	“τι”	for	“what”;	and	how	would	we	build,	Whatever?		
	
S:	 Ὀ,τι	[óti].		
	
T:	 Ὀ,τι.	 Good.	 So	 you	 could	 say,	 Whatever’s	 necessary;	 Whatever	 it	 needs;	
    Whatever’s	necessary.		
	
S:	 Ὀ,τι	χριεάζεται	[oti	khriázete].		
	
T:	 Ὀ,τι	χριεάζεται.	So	if	you	hear	a	verb	like	this,	you	know	you’re	really	likely	to	hear	
    “-εται”	 [ete],	 and	 think	 that	 it’s	 referring	 to	 “εσείς”	 [esís],	 if	 you	 don’t	 know	 the	
    verb.	Maybe	you	work	it	out	in	the	context,	but	if	you	don’t	know	the	verb,	if	you	
    don’t	 know	 that	 you	 have,	 χριεάζομαι,	 normally,	 you	 might	 hear	 this	 and	 be	
    focusing	 on	 “εσείς”	 (“you”	 plural),	 and	 try	 to	 understand	 what’s	 going	 on.	 In	
    writing,	you	can’t	have	that	mistake,	because	you	have	the	AI	(αι)	ending.	But	in	
    spoken	Greek,	you	can	get	confused	if	you	are	not	looking	at	the	bigger,	general	
    context	to	understand	what’s	going	on.	
	
	 Φαίνομαι	[fénome],φαίνομαι,	means	“I	seem”.	Φαίνομαι.		
	
S:	 Φαίνομαι.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	We	seem?		
	
S:	 Φαινόμαστε	[fenómaste].		
	
T:	 Φαινόμαστε.	You	could	say,	We	seem	 like	children.	 “Like”	here	is,	σαν	[san].	We	
    seem	like	children.	Σαν,	for	“like”.		
	
S:	 Φαινόμαστε	σαν	παιδιά	[fenómaste	san	pedhiá].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Φαινόμαστε	σαν	παιδιά.	You	seem?		
	
S:	 Φαίνεσαι	[fénese].		
	
T:	 Φαίνεσαι.	And,	It	seems/He	seems/She	seems?		
	
S:	 Φαίνεται	[fénete].		
	
T:	 Φαίνεται.	You	remember	the	word	for,	Ηow?		


                                                                                                  523
	
S:	 Πώς	[pos].	
	
T:	 Πώς.	If	you	want	to	say,	like,	you	know,	“What	does	it	look	like?”,	“What	does	it	
    seem	like?”,	you	can	say,	How	does	it	seem?		
	
S:	 Πώς	φαίνεται;	[pos	fénete?].		
	
T:	 Πώς	φαίνεται;	Or	you	could	say,	How	does	it	seem	to	you?	–	like,	“What	do	you	
    think?”,	“How	does	it	look?”.	How	does	it	seem	to	you?		
	
S:	 Πώς	σου	φαίνεται;	[pos	su	fénete?].		
	
T:	 Πώς	σου	φαίνεται;		
	
	 Θυμάμαι	[thimáme],	θυμάμαι,	is	“I	remember”.	Θυμάμαι.		
	
S:	 Θυμάμαι.		
	
T:	 Θυμάμαι.	So	you	see	we	have	quite	a	lot	of	verbs	that	are	built	in	this	way,	and	
    many	 extremely	 common	 ones	 as	 well,	 like	 “I	 come”	 –	 έρχομαι,	 “I	 need”	 –	
    χρειάζομαι,	 “I	 remember”	 –	 θυμάμαι.	 And	 do	 you	 notice	 something	 strange	
    about,	θυμάμαι?	If	you	compare,	χρειάζομαι,	έρχομαι,	θυμάμαι?		
	
S:	 Mm.	It’s	“-άμαι”	[áme]	not	“ομαι”	[ome].		
	
T:	 Good.	 It’s	 “-άμαι”.	 And	 what	 else	 do	 you	 notice	 though?	 Ἐρχομαι,	 χρειάζομαι,	
    θυμάμαι.		
	
S:	 The	accent	is	on	the	“-άμαι”.		
	
T:	 Good.	The	accent’s	on	the	“-άμαι”.	So,	θυμάμαι	[thimáme]	is	“I	remember”,	and	
    we	have	[á]	(ά),	“-άμαι”,	instead	of	“-ομαι”.	And	this	[á]	will	carry	through	to	the	
    “you”	form.	So	how	would	you	say,	You	remember?		
	
S:	 Θυμάσαι	[thimáse].		
	
T:	 Θυμάσαι.	 And	 also	 to	 the	 he/she/it	 form.	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	 He	 (or,	 she)	
    remembers?		
	
S:	 Θυμάται	[thimáte].		
	
T:	 Θυμάται.	 Good.	 So	 we	 have	 the	 A	 (ά)	 carrying	 through:	 -άμαι,	 -άσαι,	 -άται.	 He	
    doesn’t	remember?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θυμάται	[dhen	thimáte].		
	


                                                                                          524
T:	 Δεν	θυμάται.	But	this	A	(α)	doesn’t	carry	through	to	the	“we”	form.	We	still	have	
    “-όμαστε”	[ómaste].	So	how	would	you	say,	We	remember?		
	
S:	 Θυμόμαστε	[thimómaste].		
	
T:	 Θυμόμαστε.	 And	 we	 already	 have	 the	 accent	 on	 “-όμαστε”	 [ómaste],	 on	 the	
    ending,	which	is	maybe	why	it	doesn’t	change.	Θυμόμαστε.	We	don’t	remember?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θυμόμαστε	[dhen	thimómaste].		
	
T:	 Δεν	θυμόμαστε.		
	
	 Κοιμάμαι	[kimáme]	is	“I	sleep”.	Κοιμάμαι.		
	
S:	 Κοιμάμαι.		
	
T:	 Κοιμάμαι.	 And	 again	 we	 have	 “-άμαι”	 [áme]	 instead	 of	 “-ομαι”	 [ome],	 no?	
    Κοιμάμαι.	This	is	actually	related	to	“cemetery”.	So	“cemetery”	is	a	sleeping	place,	
    no,	 a	 “resting	 place”	 we	 say	 in	 English,	 and	 that’s	 related	 to,	 κοιμάμαι.	 Actually,	
    Latin	C’s	in	English	–	Latin	C’s	–	so	that	means	a	C	that	sounds	like	an	S,	rather	than	
    a	[k],	we	can	often	relate	back	to	Greek.	And	it	probably	went	into	English	through	
    Latin,	 but	 we	 can	 relate	 them	 back	 to	 Greek	 words,	 or	 words	 in	 Greek	 that	 also	
    came	 from	 Latin.	 So,	 for	 example,	 we’ve	 already	 seen,	 το	 κέντρο	 [to	 kéndro],	
    which	means	...	?		
	
S:	 The	centre.		
	
T:	 The	 centre.	 We	 could	 have	 “pharmacy”.	 We	 already	 have	 the	 “ph”	 there,	
    suggesting	 to	 us	 that	 the	 words	 will	 be	 similar	 in	 Greek,	 but	 we	 also	 have	 the	 C	
    that	 sounds	 like	 an	 S,	 in	 “pharmacy”	 –	 φαρμακείο	 [farmakío],	 becoming	 a	 K	 in	
    Greek.	
	
S:	 Φαρμακείο.		
	
T:	 Or,	“medicine”	or	“drugs”	–	το	φάρμακο,	τα	φάρμακα	[to	fármako,	ta	fármaka].	Ο	
    κύκλος	[o	kíklos]	–	What	do	you	think	that	might	mean?	Ο	κύκλος.	Ο	κύκλος.		
	
S:	 The	cycle.		
	
T:	 The	cycle.	What	do	you	think,	κυνικός	[kinikós]	might	mean?	Κυνικός.		
	
S:	 Cynic?		
	
T:	 Yes.	Cynical,	nο?	Cynical.	So	we	may	find	this	Latin	C	to	K	pattern	as	well,	like	in	
    κοιμάμαι,	and	“cemetery”.	Also	“Cyprus”	actually	–	Κύπρος	[kípros];	“ceramic”	–	
    κεραμικός	[keramikós];	“cinnamon”	–	κανέλλα	[kanéla].	So	we	have,	κοιμάμαι	–	“I	
    sleep”.	How	would	you	say,	Where	do	you	sleep?		


                                                                                                525
	
S:	 Πού	κοιμάσαι;	[pu	kimáse?].		
	
T:	 Πού	κοιμάσαι.	Good.	So	the	A	(ά)	carried	over,	and	the	accent	as	well,	no?	We’re	
    accenting	 the	 endings	 now.	 Κοιμάμαι,	 κοιμάσαι.	 Πού	 κοιμάσαι;	 He’s	 sleeping	
    now?		
	
S:	 Κοιμάται	τώρα	[kimáte	tóra].		
	
T:	 Κοιμάται	τώρα.		
	
S:	 Κοιμάται	τώρα.		
	
T:	 He	doesn’t	sleep	at	all.	So,	“at	all”	was,	καθόλου	[kathólu].	Καθόλου.		
	
S:	 Καθόλου.		
	
T:	 He	doesn’t	sleep	at	all.	
	
S:	 Δεν	κοιμάται	καθόλου	[dhen	kimáte	kathólu].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 κοιμάται	 καθόλου.	 So	 we	 have	 [á]	 (ά)	 again	 there	 in	 “-άται”	 [áte].	 But,	 We	
    sleep.	How	is,	We	sleep?		
	
S:	 Κοιμόμαστε	[kimómaste].		
	
T:	 Κοιμόμαστε.	We	just	have	our	normal	“-όμαστε”	[ómaste].	Κοιμόμαστε.	So	we’ve	
    seen	some	verbs	that	have	“-άμαι”	[áme],	no,	instead	of	“-ομαι”	[ome]:	κοιμάμαι	
    –	“I	sleep”;	θυμάμαι	–	“I	remember”.	We	could	also	have,	φοβάμαι	[fováme],	like	
    “phobia”.	No?	PH	to	F	[f]	(φ);	a	V	[v]	(β)	and	a	B	–	such	close	sounds.	Φοβάμαι	–	
    “I’m	scared”.	Φοβάμαι.		
	
S:	 Φοβάμαι.		
	
T:		I’m	not	scared.		
	
S:	 Δεν	φοβάμαι	[dhen	fováme].		
	
T:	 Δεν	 φοβάμαι.	 So	 here,	 in	 English,	 we’re	 using	 a	 verb	 (“I	 am”),	 and	 then	 an	
    adjective	 (a	 describing	word)	 –	“scared”,	whereas	in	Greek,	 we	 just	 have	 a	verb,	
    with	 all	 of	 that	 included,	 no?	 But	 we	 see,	 with	 the	 ending	 “-άμαι”	 [áme],	 we	
    already	 have	 “είμαι”	 included	 in	 there.	 So	 actually	 we’re	 doing	 something	 very	
    similar	 to	 English,	 if	 you	 think	 about	 it,	 when	 we	 say	 “I	 am	 scared.	 We’re	 just	
    building	it	in	a	different	way.	Δεν	φοβάμαι.	So	we	have	this	[á]	(ά)	for	“-άμαι”,	and	
    we	expect	that	to	carry	through.	So	how	do	you	say,	You	are	scared?		
	
S:	 Φοβάσαι	[fováse].		


                                                                                              526
	
T:	 Φοβάσαι.	And,	He	(or,	she)	is	scared?		
	
S:	 Φοβάται	[fováte].		
	
T:		Φοβάται.	And,	We	are	scared?		
	
S:	 Φοβόμαστε	[fovómaste].		
	
T:	 Φοβόμαστε.	 No?	 We	 don’t	 carry	 the	 A	 (ά)	 over	 to	 “we”	 	 –	 φοβόμαστε.	 So,	 with	
    these	verbs	that	don’t	end	as	expected,	like	“-ομαι”,	“-εσαι”,	“-εται”,	we	can	find	
    our	own	patterns	to	help	us	internalise	them.		
	
	 What	was,	I	bring,	like	in	“periphery”,	“ferry”;	like	in	“transfer”,	“transfer”.		
	
S:	 Φέρω	[féro].		
	
T:	 Think	a	little	more.		
	
S:	 Φέρνω	[férno].		
	
T:		Φέρνω.	Good.	And	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Φέρω	[féro].		
	
T:	 Φέρω.	It’s	easy	to	come	up	with	the	closed	version,	because	we	often	build	with	
    the	 closed	 version	 of,	 φέρνω	 [férno],	 like	 in	 “transfer”,	 “periphery”.	 And	 also	 in	
    Greek,	we	can	build	with	this	closed	version.	So,	for	example,	we	have	the	verb,	“I	
    with	 around	 bring	 myself”	 –	 συμπεριφέρομαι	 [simberiférome],	 which	 means	 “to	
    behave”,	 no?	 How	 you	 comport	 yourself.	 If	 you	 think	 in	 English,	 you	 have	
    “comport”,	and	it	means	exactly	the	same	thing.	“Port”	–	portable	–	bring;	“con”	is	
    like	 Latin,	 like	 Spanish,	 you	 know	 –	 with.	 “Com-port”	 –	 with-bring.	 And,	
    συμπεριφέρομαι	is	“with”	from	old	Greek	(συμ	[sim]),	“περι”	–	“around”,	φερόμαι	
    –	 “I	 bring”.	 So	 the	 same	 idea,	 there	 fossilised	 in	 a	 completely	 different	 wοrd.	
    Συμπεριφερόμαι	–	“I	behave”.		
	
	 And	the	M	(μ)	actually	softens	the	P	(π)	–	the	M	(μ)	of	“συμ”	[sim]	softens	that	P	
    [p]	(π),	to	a	B	[b].	Συμπερι	[simberi].	And	actually,	whenever	we	want	to	write	a	B	
    [b]	sound,	no,	we	don’t	use	the	letter	that	looks	like	a	B	(β)	–	that	gives	us	V	[v]	in	
    Greek	–	we	combine	M	(μ)	and	P	(π),	just	like	in,	μπορώ	[boró]	–	“I	can”.	So	we	
    have,	συμ-περι	[sim-peri],	but	when	we	say	this	verb,	it’s	going	to	sound	more	like	
    a	B	[b].	Συμπεριφέρομαι	[simberiférome].		
	
S:	 Συμπεριφέρομαι.		
	
T:	 Συμπεριφέρομαι.	So	of	course,	if	you	look	up	a	word	like,	you	know,	“I	behave”,	in	
    the	 dictionary,	 and	 you	 find,	 Συμπεριφέρομαι,	 you	 …	 you	 want	 to	 smash	 your	


                                                                                              527
   head	 on	 the	 dictionary.	 But	 when	 you	 divide	 it	 up,	 you	 know,	 it	 becomes	 very	
   digestible,	and	you	don’t	want	to	lose	that	habit.	Even	if	you	can’t	work	out	where	
   the	 bits	 come	 from,	 even	 if	 you	 can’t	 make	 yourself	 the	 relations	 that	 we	 make	
   here	(and	you	will	be	able	to),	just	dividing	it	up	and	splitting	it	up	is	such	a	great	
   practice.	Συμπεριφέρομαι.	You	behave?		
	
S:	 Συμπεριφέρεσαι	[simberiférese].		
	
T:	 Συμπεριφέρεσαι.	He	behaves	well.		
	
S:	 Συμπεριφέρεσαι	καλά	[simberiférese	kalá].		
	
T:	 He	behaves	well.		
	
S:	 Συμπεριφέρε	...	συμπεριφέρεται	καλά	[simberifére	…	simberiférete	kalá].		
	
T:		Συμπεριφέρεται	καλά.	We	behave.		
	
S:	 Συμπεριφερόμαστε	[simberiferómaste].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Συμπεριφερόμαστε.	All	one	word,	no?	Συμπεριφερόμαστε.		
	
	 So	now	verbs	get	even	longer,	and	as	I	said,	we	don’t	want	to	stop	trying	to	break	
    them	 up	 and	 make	 connections.	 And	 we’ll	 get	 forever	 better	 at	 that.	 And	 like	 I	
    said,	even	if	you	don’t	find	any	interesting	connection,	no,	just	breaking	the	word	
    up	and	digesting	it	in	that	way,	and	seeing	“συμ-περι-φέρομαι“,	is	really	great	for	
    digesting	your	vocabulary.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	am?		
	
Student:	Είμαι	[íme].

T:	 Ερχόμαστε.	He/She/or	It	is?		
	
S:	 Είναι	[íne].		
	
T:	 Είναι.	And	not	so	much	like	“είναι”,	we	have,	He,	or	She/It	comes?		
	
	S:	Έρχεται	[érchete].		
	
T:	 Έρχεται.	So	we	have	the	[e]	on	the	end,	spelt	like	AI	(αι),	like	it	is	in	“είναι”.	We	
    also	have	a	T	(τ),	no,	in	“έρχεται”	like	“τον,	την,	το”	[ton,	tin,	to],	so	that	can	help	
    us.	Έρχεται.		Έρχονται	[érkhonde]	means	“they	come”.	Έρχονται.		
	
S:	 Έρχονται.		
	
T:	 So	 we	 have	 ONTAI	 (“-ονται”)	 for	 our	 ending.	 And	 again	 we	 have	 the	 NT	 (vt)	
    combination,	which	gives	us	ND	[nd],	or	just	D	[d].	Έρχονται,	έρχονται	[érkhonde,	
    érkhode]	–	not	the	T	[t]	sound.	So	here,	“-ονται”	looks	more	like	“είναι”,	which	of	
    course	is	also	“they	are”	–	είναι.	Νο?	We	have	an	N	(ν),	but	maybe	we	can	think	of	
    that	N	(ν)	as	like	the	“-ουν”	[un]	ending	for	“they”,	that	we	generally	have,	but	a	
    little	contracted.	Again	the	T	(τ)	popping	up,	which	also	relates	to	“τους”,	as	well	
    as	“τον,	την,	το”,	no?	So,	έρχονται	[érkhonde]	or,	έρχονται	[érkhode],	for	“they”.

S:	 Μα	αυτή	έρχεται	σήμερα	[ma	aftí	érchete	símera].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μα	(αλλά)	αυτή	έρχεται	σήμερα	[ma	(alá)	aftí	érchete	símera].	So,	very	
    good	 for	 saying	 “αυτή”,	 no?	 We’re	 making	 that	 contrast;	 they’re	 not	 coming	
    tomorrow,	but	she	is	coming	today.	And	when	we	say	“but	she”,	you	know,	that’s	
    a	 heavy	 contrast;	 we	 really	 should	 put	 “αυτή”.	 Αλλά	 αυτή	 (μα	 αυτή)	 –	 and,	 μα	
    [ma]	 would	 be	 more	 emphatic	 than,	 αλλά	 [alá].	 Αλλά	 is	 much	 more	 neutral	 and	
    common,	let’s	say.	Αλλά	αυτή	έρχεται	σήμερα.		
	
	 Νoικιάζω	[nikiázo],	νοικιάζω,	was,	“I	rent”.	Νοικιάζω.		
	
S:	 Νοικιάζω.		
	
T:	 And	we	saw	like,	you	know,	For	rent.	How	was	that?		
	
S:	 Νοικιάζεται	[nikiázete].		
	
T:	 Νοικιάζεται.	So	how	would	you	say,	For	rent,	if	you	meant	more	than	one	building,	
    no?	They	are	for	rent.		
	
S:	 Νοικιάζονται	[nikiázonde].		
	
T:	 Νοικιάζονται.	 The	 word	 for	 “flat”,	 like,	 a	 flat,	 is,	 διαμέρισμα	 [dhiamérizma],	
    διαμέρισμα.	A	flat	–	διαμέρισμα.		
	
S:	 Διαμέρισμα.		
	
T:	 So	we	have,	διαμέρισμα:	“μέρισμα”	is	from,	μέρος	[méros],	which	means	“place”	
    or	“part”.	So	like	“apart-ment”	–	δια-μέρισμα.	So	“the	flat”	is,	το	διαμέρισμα	[to	
    dhiamérizma].	So	how	would	you	say,	flats,	or,	the	flats?		
	
S:	 Τα	διαμερίσματα	[ta	dhiamerízmata].		
	



                                                                                          530
T:	 Very	good.	Τα	διαμερίσματα.	We	can’t	add	an	A	(α)	to	this	neuter	word	to	get	the	
    plural.	It	already	ends	in	A	(α),	so	we	must	add	[ta]	(τα),	and	that	pulls	the	accent	
    as	 well.	 Διαμέρισμα	 –	 διαμερίσματα	 [dhiamérizma,	 dhiamerízmata].	 How	 would	
    you	say,	Flats	for	rent?	Flats	for	rent.		
	
S:	 Διαμερίσματα	νοικιάζονται	[dhiamerízmata	nikiázonde].		
	
T:	 Διαμερίσματα	 νοικιάζονται.	 Good.	 Or,	 maybe	 more	 common,	 Νοικιάζονται	
    διαμερίσματα	 [nikiázonde	 dhiamerízmata].	 But	 if	 you	 just	 want	 to	 say,	 They	 are	
    renting	flats,	and	you	refer	to	people	that	are	renting	flats,	how	would	that	be?		
	
S:	 Νοικιάζουν	διαμερίματα	[nikiázun	dhiamerízmata].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Νοικιάζουν	διαμερίματα.	So	as	we’ve	seen	with	some	verbs,	we	have	
    both	 versions,	 no?	 Νοικιάζω	 [nikiázo]	 –	 “I	 rent”;	 νοικιάζομαι	 [nikiázome]	 (very	
    uncommon	in	the	“I”	form,	no?)	–	I	am	rented,	I	am	for	rent.		
	
	 Χρειάζομαι	[khriázome],	χρειάζομαι,	was	...	?		
	
S:	 I	need.	
	
T:	 I	need.	And	how	would	you	say,	You	need?		
	
S:	 Χρειάζεσαι	[khriázese].		
	
T:	 Χρειάζεσαι.	Using	this	verb	how	do	you	think	you	might	say,	It’s	not	necessary?		
	
S:	 Δεν	χρειάζεται	[dhen	khriázete].		
	
T:	 Δεν	χρειάζεται.	How	would	you	say,	They	need?

S:	 Το	χρειαζόμαστε	για	σήμερα	[to	khriazómaste	ya	símera].		
	
T:	 Good.	Το	χρειαζόμαστε	για	σήμερα.		
	
	 Αισθάνομαι	[esthánome],	αισθάνομαι,	means	“I	feel”.	Αισθάνομαι.		
	
S:	 Αισθάνομαι.		
	


                                                                                         531
T:	 Αισθάνομαι.	 This	 is	 like	 in	 “aesthetics”.	 Aesthetics	 refers	 to	 the	 feelings	 that	 are	
    caused.	Like	the	numbing	drug,	no?	Αναισθησία	[anesthisía]	(anaesthesia);	“αν”	is	
    like	 “not”,	 like,	 “not	 feeling”.	 Like	 in	 “anorexia”	 –	 ανορεξία	 [anoreksía],	 which	 is	
    “not	 appetite”.	 So	 we	 can	 relate,	 αισθάνομαι	 –	 “I	 feel”,	 to	 “aesthetics”,	
    αναισθησία	(anaesthesia).	How	would	you	say,	I	don’t	feel	very	well?		
	
S:	 Δεν	αισθάνομαι	πολύ	καλά	[dhen	esthánome	polí	kalá].		
	
T:	 Δεν	αισθάνομαι	πολύ	καλά.	How	do	you	feel	today?	How	do	you	feel	today?		
	
S:	 Πώς	αισθάνεσαι	σήμερα;	[pos	esthánese	símera?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πώς	αισθάνεσαι	σήμερα;	He	feels?		
	
S:	 Αισθάνεται	[esthánete].		
	
T:	 Αισθάνεται.	And,	They	feel?		
	
S:	 Αισθάνονται	[esthánonde].		
	
T:	 Αισθάνονται.	Good.	So,	for	this	type	of	verbs,	we	have	just	the	“you”	plural	left	to	
    see.	So	what	is	the	word	for,	You	(plural).	We	have,	εσύ	[esí],	which	is	“you”;	but	
    then	to	make	that	plural	or	formal	...	?		
	
S:	 Εσείς	[esís].		
	
T:	 Εσείς.	And	how	do	you	say,	You	(plural),	or,	You	(formal)	are?	You	guys	are.	You	
    are.	Εσείς	...	?		
	
S:	 Είστε	[íste].		
	
T:	 Είστε.	 So	 for	 these	 types	 of	 verbs,	 like,	 έρχομαι,	 for	 example,	 for	 “εσείς”,	 our	
    ending	is	“-εστε”	[este].	Again,	very	similar	to	“έιστε”.	So,	“You	guys	are	coming”	
    is,	έρχεστε	[ércheste].		
	
S:	 Έρχεστε.		
	
T:	 Aren’t	you	guys	coming?		
	
S:	 Δεν	έρχεστε;	[dhen	ércheste?].		
	
T:	 Δεν	έρχεστε;	And	again,	the	[kh]	(χ)	is	softened	here,	no,	by	the	[e]	(ε)	that	follows,	
    the	[e]	(ε)	of	“-εστε”	[este].	Έρχεστε	[ércheste].	Also,	the	“-εστε”	[este]	ending	is	
    spelt	with	an	E	(ε).	That	[e]	sound	on	the	end	is	spelt	with	an	E	(ε),	just	like	“είστε”.	
    Είστε	[íste]	is	also	spelt	with	an	E	(ε),	rather	than	the	AI	(αι)	that	you	usually	find	in	
    the	verb	for	“to	be”.		
	


                                                                                                532
	 How	would	you	say,	What	do	you	need?	–	and	we	are	talking	to	one	person.	What	
    do	you	need?		
	
S:	 Τι	χρειάζεσαι;	[ti	khriázese?].		
	
T:	 Τι	χρειάζεσαι;	And	to	more	than	one	person?		
	
S:	 Τι	χρειάζεστε;	[ti	khriázeste?].		
	
T:		Τι	χρειάζεστε;	So	in	sound	as	well,	we	can	just	think	of	this	as	adding	a	T	(τ)	sound	
    [t],	 no,	 to	 the	 singular	 “you”.	 We	 have,	 χρειάζεσαι	 [khriázese],	 and,	 χρειάζεστε	
    [khriázeste].	So	adding	a	Τ	(τ)	after	the	S	(σ),	in	sound.	Χρειάζεσαι	–	χρειάζεστε.		
	
	 How	would	you	say,	Where	do	you	find	yourself?	–	again,	talking	to	one	person.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	come?		
	
Student:	Έρχομαι	[érkhome].		
	
T:	 Έρχομαι.	And,	I	need?	Do	you	remember	it?	It	started	“Χρει	...	”	[khri].		
	
S:	 Χρειάζομαι	[khriázome].		
	
T:	 Χρειάζομαι.	I	imagine	–	like	“fantasy”?		
	
S:	 Φαντάζομαι	[fandázome].		
	
T:	 Φαντάζομαι.	 So	 these	 verbs	 behave	 in	 a	 slightly	 different	 way,	 no,	 with	 “-ομαι”	
    [ome],	 “-εσαι”	 [ése],	 etc.,	 and	 now	 that	 we’re	 so	 far	 into	 our	 investigation	 of	
    Greek,	and	of	language,	you’re	already	aware	of	all	of	the	things	that	you	need	to	
    find	out,	in	order	to	use	these	verbs,	no?	I	mean	the	closed	form,	the	pasts,	how	
    to	give	the	order,	etc.,	etc.,	etc.	And	that’s	not	daunting;	it	actually	just	means	we	
    now	understand	how	to	break	down	language.	And	if	you	want	to	learn	any	other	
    language,	you	have	a	great	idea	now,	right	from	the	outset,	of	what	you’re	looking	
    for.	So	we	get	to	recap	all	of	the	things	we	can	do	with	verbs,	with	this	new	type	of	
    verb.	So	let’s	find	their	closed	form;	let’s	find	the	closed	forms	of	these	verbs.		
	
	 What	was,	You	speak?	You	speak	–	informally.		
	
S:	 Μιλάς	[milás].		
	
T:	 Μιλάς.	And,	You	will	speak?		
	
S:	 Θα	μιλήσεις	[tha	milísis].		
	
T:	 Θα	μιλήσεις.	So	just	as	with	these	verbs	that	have	their	accents	on	the	end,	we	go	
    back	 to	 normal	 endings	 when	 we’re	 in	 the	 closed	 form,	 no?	 We	 go	 from,	 Μιλάς	
    [milás]	 to,	 Θα	 μιλήσεις	 [tha	 milísis]:	 we	 use	 “-εις”	 [is],	 the	 normal	 ending,	 for	
    “you”.	Also,	with	these	“-ομαι”	[ome],	“-εσαι”	[ese]	verbs,	we	will	just	use	normal	
    endings	when	we	go	into	our	closed	form.	So	rather	than	“-ομαι”,	[o]	(-ω);	rather	
    than	“-εσαι”,	[is]	(-εις).		
	
	 But	 of	 course	 we	 need	 to	 find	 that	 closed	 form.	 So	 for	 those	 verbs	 not	 using	
    “-ομαι”	[ομε],	no,	using	“-άμαι”	[áme],	for	example,	and	having	their	accents	on	
    the	endings	as	well	(like	in,	θυμάμαι	[thimáme]	–	“I	remember”;	like	in,	κοιμάμαι	
    [kimáme]	–	“I	sleep”),	for	this	type	of	verb,	which	is	especially	common,	to	get	the	
    closed	 form	 of	 these,	 we	 add	 [ith]	 (ηθ),	 and	 then	 we	 add	 our	 ending,	 which	 we	
    accent.	So,	θυμάμαι,	in	its	closed	form	becomes,	θυμηθώ	[thimithó].	Θυμηθώ.	We	
    lose	 “-άμαι”,	 our	 ending,	 we	 add	 [ith]	 (ηθ),	 and	 then	 we	 add	 our	 ending	 for	 “I”,	
    and	we	accent	that.	Θυμηθώ.		


                                                                                               535
	
S:	 Θυμηθώ.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	You	must	remember?		
	
S:	 Πρέπει	να	θυμηθείς	[prépi	na	thimithís].		
	
T:	 Πρέπει	να	θυμηθείς.	What	was,	I	sleep,	related	to	“cemetery”?		
	
	S:	Κοιμάμαι	[kimáme].		
	
T:	 Κοιμάμαι.	So	if	we	want	to	find	the	closed	form	of,	κοιμάμαι,	what’s	the	first	thing	
    we	do?	
	
S:	 The	“-άμαι”	gets	dropped.	
	
T:	 Good.	We	lose	the	“-άμαι”,	and	we’re	left	with	“κοιμ	...	[kim]”,	no?	And	then	what	
    do	we	add?		
	
S:	 [ith]	(ηθ).	
	
T:	 [ith]	(ηθ).	And	then?		
	
S:	 And	then	the	ending.		
	
T:	 So,	if	you	want	to	say,	I	sleep,	in	the	closed	form?		
	
S:	 Κοιμηθώ	[kimithó].		
	
T:	 Κοιμηθώ.	And	we	accent	that	ending	as	well.	Κοιμηθώ.	I	will	sleep.		
	
S:	 θα	κοιμηθώ	[tha	kimithó].		
	
T:	 θα	κοιμηθώ.	Will	you	sleep	now?		
	
S:	 Θα	κοιμηθείς	τώρα;	[tha	kimithís	tóra?].		
	
T:	 Θα	κοιμηθείς	τώρα;	I	saw	him	sleeping.	I	saw	him	sleeping.	So	this	isn’t	“I	saw	him	
    whilst	I	was	sleeping”	–	so	we	don’t	look	for	“-ING”,	no?	We	don’t	use	this	“-ing”	in	
    Greek	as	much	as	we	do	in	English.	So	when	we	have	a	sentence	like	this	–	“I	saw	
    him	sleeping”,	and	we	mean,	“He	was	sleeping”,	we	connect	these	ideas	with	“να”	
    [na].	I	saw	him,	να,	he	sleeps.		
	
S:	 Τον	είδα	να	κοιμάται	[ton	ídha	na	kimáte].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Τον	είδα	να	κοιμάται.	He	will	sleep.		
	


                                                                                     536
S:	 Θα	κοιμηθεί	[tha	kimithí].		
	
T:	 Θα	κοιμηθεί.	Θεωρώ	[theoró],	θεωρώ,	was	“I	consider”.	I	consider.		
	
S:	 Θεωρώ.		
	
T:	 We	consider?			
	
S:	 Θεωρούμε	[theorúme].		
	
T:	 Θεωρούμε.	And,	I	am	considered?	I’m	considered.		
	
S:	 Θεωράμαι	[theoráme].		
	
T:	 It’s	actually	the	same	as	the	“we”	form	of,	θεωρώ	[theoró].		
	
S:	 Θεωρούμαι	[theorúme].		
	
T:	 Θεωρούμαι.	So,	you	know,	“-ομαι”	[ome]	is	our	standard	ending	for	“I”	with	this	
    type	of	verb,	but	then	we	can	have	other	endings	that	are	accented.	Θεωρούμαι	
    [theorúme].	 We’ve	 seen	 “-άμαι”	 [áme];	 we’ve	 seen	 “-ούμαι”	 [úme].	 How	 would	
    you	say,	I	will	be	considered?	So	what’s	the	first	thing	you	do	to,	θεωρούμαι?		
	
S:	 Drop	the	“-ούμαι”	[úme]	and	then	add	[ith]	(ηθ).		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	I	will	be	considered?		
	
S:	 Θα	θεωρηθώ	[tha	theorithó].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	θεωρηθώ.	A	lot	of	[th]	(θ),	no?	Θα	θεωρηθώ.	Good.	So	this	isn’t	like	
    to	be	considered	for	a	job,	or	something.	This	is	“to	be	considered	as”,	“thought	of	
    as	something”.	So	you	could	say	something	like,	you	know,	“I	will	be	considered	
    dishonest	if	I	do	that”,	you	know.	“Dishonest”	–	we	have,	ανέντιμος	[anéndimos].	
    Ανέντιμος.		
	
S:	 Ανέντιμος.		
	
T:	 So	again,	ανέντιμος,	that’s	spelt	with	a	T	(τ);	we	have	NT	(ντ)	there,	giving	us	an	
    ND	 [nd]	 or	 D	 [d]	 sound:	 ανέντιμος,	 ανέντιμος	 [anéndimos,	 anédimos].	 So	 it’s	
    important	 to	 realise	 that’s	 a	 T	 (τ),	 if	 we	 want	 to	 break	 the	 word	 up.	 We	 saw	
    before,	 τιμή	 [timí],	 the	 word	 for	 price,	 or	 honour,	 as	 in,	 προτιμώ	 [protimó]	 –	 “I	
    prefer”	 (I	 first	 honour).	 So,	 ανέντιμος	 [anéndimos]:	 we	 have,	 έντιμος	 [éndimos],	
    which	 means	 “honourable”;	 and	 then,	 ανέντιμος	 –	 that	 “αν”	 gives	 us	 like	 “dis”,	
    dishonourable,	 dishonest.	 Ανέντιμος.	 So	 you	 could	 say	 something	 like,	 I	 will	 be	
    considered	dishonourable	(dishonest)	if	I	do	that.	So,	I	will	be	considered.		
	
S:	 Θα	θεωρηθώ	[tha	theorithó].		


                                                                                               537
	
T:	 Dishonourable.		
	
S:	 Ανέντιμος	[anéndimos].		
	
T:	 Θα	θεωρηθώ	ανέντιμος	[tha	theorithó	anéndimos]	(or,	ανέντιμη	[anéndimi]	for	a	
    female).	If	I	do	that.	Or,	If	I	do	this	–	probably	be	most	common	in	Greek.		
	
S:	 Aν	θα	έκανα	αυτό	[an	tha	ékana	aftó].		
	
T:	 That	means,	“If	I	would	do	that”,	which	you	don’t	really	need	to	say.		
	
S:	 Aν	κάνω	αυτό	[an	káno	aftó].		
	
T:	 Aν	 κάνω	 αυτό.	 Good.	 Θα	 θεωρηθώ	 ανέντιμος	 αν	 κάνω	 αυτό	 [tha	 theorithó	
    anéndimos	 an	 káno	 aftó].	 And	 you	 might	 also	 hear	 that	 information	 of	 “αυτό”	
    repeated	 –	 Αν	 το	 κάνω	 αυτό.	 Θα	 θεωρηθώ	 ανέντιμος	 αν	 το	 κάνω	 αυτό	 [tha	
    theorithó	anéndimos	an	to	káno	aftó].		
	
	 So	with	this	type	of	verb,	this	“-ομαι”	[ome]	verb,	and	when	we	don’t	use	“-ομαι”	
    we	use	a	different	ending,	which	takes	the	accent,	the	closed	form	is	really	easy	to	
    find.	 We	 just	 add	 [ith]	 (ηθ),	 nο?	 Θυμάμαι	 –	 θυμηθώ;	 κοιμάμαι	 –	 κοιμηθώ;	
    θεωρούμαι	–	θεωρηθώ.		
	
	 What	was,	I	walk?		
	
S:	 Περπαταώ	[perpatáo].		
	
T:	 Περπαταώ.	And	the	closed	version	of,	περπαταώ?		
	
S:	 Περπατήσω	[perpatíso].		
	
T:	 Περπατήσω.	So	actually,	we	see	something	in	common	between	“περπαταώ”	and	
    “περπατήσω”,	 and	 “κοιμάμαι”	 and	 “κοιμηθώ”,	 for	 example.	 With	 those	 verbs,	
    those	 normal	 verbs	 with	 their	 accents	 on	 the	 ending,	 like,	 περπαταώ,	 no,	 to	 get	
    the	closed	form	we	add	[is]	(ης)	–	περπατήσω;	and	in	the	same	way	when	we	have	
    “-άμαι”	[áme],	for	example,	you	know,	carrying	the	accent,	we	go	to	[ith]	(ηθ).	So	
    just	 like	 it	 was	 very	 easy	 to	 find	 the	 closed	 form	 with	 those	 verbs	 with	 their	
    accents	 on	 the	 end,	 no:	 μιλαώ	 –	 μιλήσω	 [miláo,	 milíso];	 αγαπαώ	 –	 αγαπήσω	
    [aghapáo,	 aghapíso];	 ρωταώ	 –	 ρωτήσω	 [rotáo,	 rotíso];	 the	 same	 goes	 with	 this	
    second	family	of	verbs	we’re	seeing,	no?	They	use	[ith]	(ηθ)	when	they	have	their	
    accents	on	the	end:	κοιμάμαι	–	κοιμηθώ;	θεωρούμαι	–	θεωρηθώ.		
	
	 But	with	those	verbs	that	don’t	have	their	accent	on	the	end	–	so	those	that	use	
    “-ομαι”	[ome],	“-εσαι”	[ese],	“-εται”	[ete],	finding	the	closed	form	is	a	little	more	
    complicated.	So,	for	example,	we	have	“I	get	lost”	–	χάνομαι	[khánome];	and	then	
    the	closed	form	is,	χαθώ	[khathó].		


                                                                                             538
	
S:	 Χαθώ.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	We	won’t	get	lost?		
	
S:	 Δεν	θα	...	δεν	θα	χάθουμε	[dhen	tha	…	dhen	tha	kháthume].		
	
T:	 Good.	 But	 like	 in,	 χαθώ	 [khathó],	 no,	 we	 will	 accent	 the	 ending.	 So,	 Δεν	 θα	
    χαθούμε	[dhen	tha	khathúme].		
	
	 We	 have,	 σκέφτομαι	 [skéftome]	–	 “I	 think”,	 like	 “sceptical”,	 and	 then	 the	 closed	
    version	is,	σκεφτώ	[skeftó].		
	
S:	 Σκεφτώ.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	I	will	think	about	it,	or	just,	I	will	think	it?		
	
S:	 Θα	το	σκεφτώ	[tha	to	skeftó].		
	
T:	 Θα	το	σκεφτώ.		
	
	 “I	need”	was,	χρειάζομαι	[khriázome].		
	
S:	 Χρειάζομαι.		
	
T:	 How	is,	You	need?		
	
S:	 Χρειάζεσαι	[khriázese].		
	
T:	 Χρειάζεσαι.	The	closed	version	of,	χρειάζομαι,	is,	χρειαστώ	[khriastó].	Χπρειαστώ.		
	
S:	 Χπρειαστώ.		
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	When	will	you	need	it?	When	will	you	need	it?		
	
S:	 Πότε	θα	το	χρειαστείς;	[póte	tha	to	khriastís?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Πότε	θα	το	χρειαστείς;	How	would	you	say,	For	how	long	will	you	need	
    it?	 So	 for,	 “For	 how	 long”,	 you	 could	 say	 “For	 how	 much”,	 and	 it	 can	 be	
    understood	 that	 you	 mean,	 time.	 Or	 you	 can	 say	 “For	 how	 much	 time”.	 So	 the	
    word	for,	How,	was?		
	
S:	 Πώς	[pos].		
	
T:		Πώς.	And	“How	much”	is,	πόσο	[póso].	So,	For	how	much	time	(for	how	long)	will	
    you	need	it?		
	


                                                                                         539
S:	 Για	πόσο	θα	το	χρειαστείς;	[ya	póso	tha	to	khriastís?].		
	
T:	 Για	πόσο	θα	το	χρειαστείς;	Or,	Για	πόσο	καιρό	θα	το	χρειαστείς;	[ya	póso	keró	tha	
    to	 khriastís?].	 Καιρός	 [kerós],	 by	 the	 way,	 also	 means	 “weather”,	 other	 than	
    “time”;	 also	 “weather”	 –	 like	 “tiempo”	 in	 Spanish,	 no,	 which	 is	 “time”	 and	
    “weather”.		How	 would	 you	 say,	 How	 is	 the	 weather	 there?	 How	 is	 the	 weather	
    there?		
	
S:	 Πώς	είναι	ο	καιρός	εκεί;	[pos	íne	o	kerós	ekí?].		
	
T:	 Good.	Πως	είναι	ο	καιρός	εκεί;	How	is	the	weather	there?		
	
	 So	 as	 we	 see	 in,	 χάνομαι	 –	 χαθώ,	 σκέφτομαι	 –	 σκεφτώ,	 χρειάζομαι	 –	 χρειαστώ,	
    getting	the	closed	version	of	these	verbs	is	a	little	more	complicated	than	with	our	
    verbs	which	accent	the	endings,	no,	and	just	use	[ith]	(ηθ).	But	we	will	find	many	
    patterns,	 as	 we	 did	 with	 our	 standard	 verbs	 before,	 in	 order	 to	 find	 our	 closed	
    version.		
	
	 We	notice	that	we	always	have	a	T	(τ)	or	a	TH	(θ),	no?	Χαθώ,	σκεφτώ,	χρειαστώ	
    [khathó,	 skeftó,	 khriastó].	 And	 we	 also	 see	 that	 we	 can	 have	 another	 sound	
    change	 to	 the	 consonant	 before	 –	 that	 [th]	 (θ)	 or	 that	 [t]	 (τ).	 It	 can	 completely	
    disappear,	like	the	N	(ν)	does	in,	χάνομαι	[khánome],	when	we	get,	χαθώ	[khathó];	
    that	N	(ν)	completely	disappears.	We	can	see	a	letter	change,	like	in,	χρειάζομαι	
    [khriázome]	and	χρειαστώ	[khriastó].	That	Z	(ζ)	in	χρειάζομαι	changes	to	an	S	(σ)	
    when	 we	 add	 our	 T	 (τ)	 –	 χρειαστώ.	 And	 we	 can	 also	 think	 that	 we	 are	 always	
    adding	TH	(θ),	but	TH	(θ)	might	interact	with	the	previous	sound	in	a	number	of	
    ways,	no,	either	deleting	it,	changing	it,	or	the	TH	(θ)	itself	changing	to	a	T	(τ).		
	
	                                 	




                                                                                                540

    thimithís].	So	after	“όταν”,	no,	we	have	to	think	about	also	whether	we	want	our	
    open	 or	 closed	 form	 of	 the	 verb.	 So,	 “When	 you	 remember”,	 you	 know,	 that’s	
    definitely	 a	 closed	 event.	 Once.	 Πες	 μου	 όταν	 το	 θυμηθείς.	 Πες	 μου	 όταν	
    θυμηθείς.		
	
	 So	it’s	easy	to	get	the	closed	version	of	these	verbs	that	have	their	accent	on	the	
    ending	–	we	just	add	[ith]	(ηθ).	Θυμάμαι–θυμηθώ	[thimáme,	thimithó];	κοιμάμαι–
    κοιμηθώ	 [kimáme,	 kimithó].	 With	 other	 verbs	 it’s	 slightly	 more	 complicated,	 but	


                                                                                           541
   we	can	find	our	own	patterns,	and	mostly	we	will	have	the	same	TH	(θ)	[th]	or	T	(τ)	
   [t]	sound	popping	up.	So	I	mentioned,	χάνομαι	[khánome]	–	“I	get	lost”,	and	the	
   closed	version,	χαθώ	[khathó].	So	here	we	have	a	TH	(θ),	and	then	TH	(θ)	deletes	
   the	N	(ν)	of,	χάνομαι.	Χάνομαι	–	χαθώ.		
	
S:	 Χαθώ.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	You	will	get	lost?		
	
S:	 Θα	χάθεις	[tha	kháthis].		
	
T:	 We	have	our	accent	on	the	ending,	no?	Even	if	we	don’t	in,	χάνομαι,	when	we	go	
    into	the	closed	form,	χαθώ,	no,	we	accent	that	ending.	So,	You	will	get	lost.		
	
S:	 Θα	χαθείς	[tha	khathís].		
	
T:	 Θα	χαθείς	[tha	khathís].	Very	good.	Θα	χαθείς.	So	we	have	a	TH	(θ)	for	our	closed	
    form,	and	that	deletes	the	N	(ν).	So,	we	want	to	look	out	to	see	if	this	is	a	pattern	
    –	if	this	happens	in	other	places.		
	
	 The	word	for	“crazy”	in	Greek	is,	τρελός	[trelós].	Τρελός.		
	
S:	 Τρελός.		
	
T:	 Like,	T-R-E-L-O-S.	Τρελός.	How	would	you	say,	You’re	crazy?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	τρελός	[íse	trelós].		
	
T:	 Είσαι	τρελός.	Είσαι	τρελή	[íse	trelí].	How	would	you	call	somebody	“crazy”,	talking	
    to	a	male,	like,	“Hey,	Crazy!”?		
	
S:	 Τρελέ	[trelé].		
	
T:	 Τρελέ.	Very	good.	We	have	“-ος”	[os],	no,	so	to	get	our	vocative,	to	call	a	male	(we	
    only	use	this	with	males,	in	the	singular),	we	remove	that	“-ος”	and	we	add	“-ε”	
    [e]:	τρελέ.	If	you	go	to	Cyprus,	you	will	hear,	Πελέ	[pelé]	all	the	time.	In	Cyprus	we	
    say,	 πελός	 [pelós]	 for	 “crazy”,	 so	 you	 will	 hear,	 πελέ,	 a	 lot,	 in	 …	 only	 between	
    friends.	Πελέ	μου	[pelé	mu].	“I	go	crazy”	is,	τρελαίνομαι	[trelénome].		
	
S:	 Τρελαίνομαι.		
	
T:	 Τρελαίνομαι.	 So	 “-ομαι”	 [ome]	 carries	 the	 meaning,	 literally,	 no,	 of	 “myself”	 or	
    like,	“I	am”.	In	this	case,	“I	get	crazy”	is	something	like	“I	crazy	myself”,	rather	than	
    “I	am	crazy”,	no,	which	would	be,	Είμαι	τρελός	[íme	trelós].	So,	Τρελαίνομαι	–	“I	
    crazy	myself”,	“I	get	crazy”.	So,	we	have	an	N	(ν)	there,	no?	Τρελαίνομαι.	So	when	
    we	go	into	our	closed	form	and	we	add	[th]	(θ),	that	N	(ν)	will	disappear,	just	like	
    between,	χάνομαι	and,	χαθώ.	But	also	we	have	another	change:	τρελαίνομαι,	this	


                                                                                               542
   [e]	 sound,	 of	 “λαί”	 [le],	 τρελαίνομαι,	 is	 spelt	 AI	 (αι)	 [e],	 and	 that	 I	 (ι)	 gets	
   swallowed	up	when	we	add	our	TH	(θ).	So	you	want	to	give	that	a	try?	How	that	
   will	sound	–	the	closed	form	of,	τρελαίνομαι	[trelénome]?		
	
S:	 Τρελαθώ	[trelathó].		
	
T:	 Τρελαθώ.	Very	good.	So,	we	have	AI	(αι),	giving	us	[e]	in,	τρελαίνομαι,	but	if	we	
    lose	that	I	(ι),	we’re	just	left	with	the	A	(α),	no?	Τρελαθώ.	I	will	go	crazy.		
	
S:	 Θα	τρελαθώ	[tha	trelathó].		
	
T:	 Θα	 τρελαθώ.	 So	 again	 we	 lose	 the	 N	 (v),	 no?	 Χάνομαι	 –	 χαθώ;	 τρελαίνομαι	 –	
    τρελαθώ.	Although	we	have	another	small	change	there,	as	well,	no,	in	the	vowel;	
    τρελαίνομαι	–	τρελαθώ	[trelénome,	trelathó].		
	
	 And	we	can	get	the	past	quite	easily	from	our	closed	version	of	these	verbs.	We	
    have	 the	 same	 past	 endings	 as	 always,	 but	 we	 add	 [ik]	 (“-ηκ-”)	 before	 the	 past	
    ending.	So,	“I	got	lost”	is,	χάθηκα	[kháthika].	Χάθηκα.		
	
S:	 Χάθηκα.		
	
T:	 And	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 third	 from	 the	 end	 like	 always,	 no,	 in	 the	 past.	 And	
    actually	the	reason	we’re	adding	this	[ik]	(ηκ),	is	to	give	us	an	extra	syllable.	It’s	to	
    give	us	an	extra	syllable,	but	instead	of	adding	one	at	the	beginning	as	we	do	with	
    normal	verbs,	so	for	example,	χάνω	[kháno]	to	χάσω	[kháso]	and,	έχασα	[ékhasa]	
    –	“I	lost”,	no?	With	these	verbs	we’re	adding	a	syllable,	but	it’s	before	the	ending,	
    [ik]	(ηκ).	So	we	get	[ika],	χάθηκα	[kháthika].	How	would	you	say,	I	got	crazy?	We	
    have,	τρελαθώ	[trelathó],	so	…	?		
	
S:	 Τρελάθηκα	[treláthika].		
	
T:	 Τρελάθηκα.	 So	 it	 doesn’t	 matter,	 you	 know,	 if	 we	 have	 already	 more	 than	 two	
    syllables,	no?	We’re	always	putting	this	[ik]	(ηκ);	we’re	always	inserting	this	extra	
    syllable.	Τρελάθηκα.	We	got	crazy?		
	
S:	 Τρελαθήκαμε	[trelathíkame].		
	
T:	 Good.	 We	 keep	 the	 accent	 third	 from	 the	 end.	 Τρελαθήκαμε.	 Why	 did	 you	 get	
    crazy,	my	friend?	Why	did	you	get	crazy,	my	friend?		
	
S:	 Γιατί	τρελάθηκες,	φίλε	μου;	[yatí	treláthikes,	fíle	mu?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Γιατί	 τρελάθηκες,	 φίλε	 μου;	 Or	 you	 could	 say,	 βρε	 φίλε	 μου	 [vre	 fíle	
    mu].	This	is	common,	the	word	“βρε”	[vre]	–	it’s	like	to	get	someone’s	attention,	
    to	 be	 emphatic.	 Βρε	 [vre],	 or	 ρε	 [re].	 Γιατί	 τρελάθηκες,	 βρε	 φίλε	 μου;	 [yatí	
    treláthikes,	vre	fíle	mu?].	What	if	you	are	talking	to	more	than	one	person.	Why	
    did	you	guys	get	crazy,	my	friends?		


                                                                                              543
	
S:	 Γιατί	τρελαθήκατε,	φίλοι	μου;	[yatí	trelathíkate,	fíli	mu?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Γιατί	τρελαθήκατε,	φίλοι	μου;	…	βρε	φίλοι	μου	[vre	fíli	mu].	And,	you	
    know,	for	the	plural	“friends”,	we	don’t	have	any	different	way	to	address	them	–	
    just,	φίλοι	[fíli],	the	plural.		
	
	 What	was,	I	need?		
	
S:	 Χρειάζομαι	[khriázome].		
	
T:	 Χρειάζομαι.	The	closed	version	was,	χρειαστώ	[khriastó].	Χρειαστώ.		
	
S:	 Χρειαστώ.		
	
T:	 You	remember	how	to	say,	I	get	tired?	We	had,	κουράζω	[kurázo],	for	“I	tire”,	like	
    “I	tire	someone	else”.	But,	I	get	tired;	I	tire	myself?		
	
S:	 Κουράζομαι	[kurázome].		
	
T:	 Κουράζομαι.	The	closed	version	of	κουράζομαι	is,	κουραστώ	[kurastó].	Κουραστώ.		
	
S:	 Κουραστώ.		
	
T:	 So	actually	we’ve	found	another	pattern,	no:	“-άζομαι”	[ázome]	to	“-αστώ”	[astó].	
    Χρειάζομαι	–	χρειαστώ	[khriázome,	khriastó];	κουράζομαι	–	κουραστώ	[kurázome,	
    kurastó].	And	in	both	cases	the	Z’s	(ζ)	are	changing	to	S’s	(σ),	no?	Κουράζομαι	–
    κουραστώ;	χρειάζομαι	–	χρειαστώ.	Do	you	get	tired?		
	
S:	 Κουράζεσαι;	[kurázese?].		
	
T:	 Κουράζεσαι;	You	will	get	tired.		
	
S:	 Θα	κουραστείς	[tha	kurastís].		
	
T:	 Θα	κουραστείς.	I	got	tired.		
	
S:	 Κουράστηκα	[kurástika].		
	
T:	 Κουράστηκα.	 This	 can	 also	 mean,	 like,	 you	 know,	 “I	 got	 fed	 up”.	 Κουράστηκα.	
    Κουράστηκα	με	αυτον	–	“I	got	fed	with	him”.	Did	you	get	tired?		
	
S:	 Κουράστηκες;	[kurástikes?].		
	
T:	 Κουράστηκες;	Did	you	guys	get	tired?		
	
S:	 Κουραστήκατε;	[kurastíkate?].

T:	 Κουραστήκατε;	Very	good.	They	got	tired.		
	
S:	 Κουράστηκαν	[kurástikan].		
	
T:	 Κουράστηκαν	or,	κουραστήκανε	[kurastíkane],	we	could	hear.		
	
	 What	was,	I	imagine?		
	
S:	 Φαντάζομαι	[fandázome].		
	
T:	 Φαντάζομαι.	 So,	 do	 you	 notice	 anything?	 Do	 notice	 you	 a	 familiarity,	 a	 familiar	
    pattern?	
	
S:	 It	has	the	“-ζομαι”	[zome].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	how	might	the	closed	version	be?		
	
S:	 Φανταστώ	[fandastó].		
	
T:	 Φανταστώ.	Φανταστώ.	Let’s	imagine.		
	
S:	 Να	φαντασούμε	[na	fandastúme].	Ας	φαντασούμε	[as	fandastúme].		
	
T:	 Good.	Να	φαντασούμε.	Ας	φαντασούμε.	Let’s	imagine.		
	
	 “I	am	born”,	I	am	born	is,	γεννιέμαι	[yenyéme].	Γεννιέμαι.		
	
S:	 Γεννιέμαι.		
	
T:	 So	what’s	the	first	thing	you	notice	about,	γεννιέμαι?		
	
S:	 It’s	got	the	“-ιέμαι”	[yéme].		
	
T:		It’s	“-ιέμαι”;	it’s	not	“-ομαι”	[ome].	No?	Which	also	means	that	it’s	accented,	no?	
    We	notice	it’s	accented;	the	ending	there	is	accented.	Γεννιέμαι.	So	even	though	
    it’s	 not	 a	 familiar	 one	 like	 “-άμαι”	 [áme],	 you	 know,	 that	 we’ve	 seen	 more	
    commonly,	we	still	know	what	it	does	to	get	into	the	closed	form.	It	has	the	accent	
    on	the	end,	so	the	closed	form	of,	γεννιέμαι	–	I	am	born,	is?		
	
S:	 Γεννηθώ	[yenithó].		
	
T:	 Γεννηθώ.	Γεννιέμαι	[yenyéme],	which	is	the,	γάμα	[gháma]	(γ)	-	E	(ε)	-	Double	N	
    (ν)	 -	 IE	 (ιέ)	 –	 which	 gives	 us	 this	 [yé]	 sound	 –	 MAI	 (μαι)	 [me].	 Γεννιέμαι	 –	 “I	 am	
    born”,	is	actually	related	to	“genetics”,	no?	Spelt	with	γάμα	[gháma]	(γ),	which	has	
    been	 softened	 by	 the	 E	 sound	 [e],	 and	 we	 have	 the	 G	 in	 “genetics”.	 Γεννιέμαι	 –	



                                                                                                   545
   “I’m	born”,	and,	γεννηθώ	[yenithó],	no,	the	closed	version.	How	would	you	say,	He	
   will	be	born	soon?		
	
S:	 Θα	γεννηθεί	σύντομα	[tha	yenithí	sídoma].		
	
T:	 Θα	γεννηθεί	σύντομα.	He	was	born.		
	
S:	 Γεννήθηκε	[yeníthike].		
	
T:		Γεννήθηκε.	You	were	born.		
	
S:	 Γεννήθηκες	[yeníthikes].		
	
T:	 Γεννήθηκες.	Where	were	you	born?		
	
S:	 Πού	γεννήθηκες;	[pu	yeníthikes?].		
	
T:	 Πού	γεννήθηκες;	I	was	born	in	England.	So	to	say,	I	was	born	in	England,	we	will	
    say,	in	the	England.	“England”	is,	Αγγλία	[anglía].	Αγγλία.		
	
S:	 Αγγλία.		
	
T:		Αγγλία	is	spelt	with	two	gammas	(γ).	We’ve	seen	how	that	gives	us	NG	[ng],	or	just	
    a	G	[g],	like	in	the	word,	άγγελος	[ángelos]	–	“angel”,	or	“Angelo”.	No?	We	could	
    hear	 άγγελος	 [ángelos]	 or,	 άγγελος	 [ágelos].	 So	 for	 “England”,	 we	 could	 hear	
    [anglía]	or	[aglía].	So	how	would	you	say,	I	was	born	in	England?	I	was	born	in	the	
    England.		
	
S:	 Γεννήθηκα	στην	Αγγλία	[yeníthika	stin	anglía].		
	
T:	 Γεννήθηκα	 στην	 Αγγλία.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 wasn’t	 born	 yesterday?	 I	 wasn’t	
    born	yesterday.		
	
S:	 Δεν	γεννήθηκα	χθες	[dhen	yeníthika	khthes].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	γεννήθηκα	χθες.	I	wasn’t	born	yesterday.	You	know,	like,	“I’m	not	
    stupid”.		
	
	                               	




                                                                                       546

Teacher:	How	would	you	say,	Do	you	remember	me?	Do	you	remember	me?		
	
Student:	Με	θυμάσαι;	[me	thimáse?].		
	
T:	 Do	you	remember	me?	Με	θυμάσαι;	How	would	you	say,	You	will	remember	me?		
	
S:	 Θα	με	θυμηθείς	[tha	me	thimithís].		
	
T:	 Θα	 με	 θυμηθείς.	 Very	 good.	 And,	 Θα	 με	 θυμηθείς,	 you	 can	 also	 use	 like	 an	
    expression	to	mean,	like,	“You	will	see	that	I	am	right”.	You	will	remember	me.	Θα	
    με	θυμηθείς.	What	was,	I	lose?		
	
S:	 Χάνω	[kháno].		
	
T:	 Χάνω.	I	get	lost.		
	
S:	 Χάνομαι	[khánome].		
	
T:	 Χάνομαι.	And,	χάνομαι,	in	the	closed	version?		
	
S:	 Χαθώ	[khathó].		
	
T:	 Χαθώ,	χαθώ.	I	don’t	want	us	to	get	lost.	I	don’t	want,	να	[na],	we	get	lost.		
	
S:	 Δεν	θέλω	να	χαθούμε	[dhen	thélo	na	khathúme].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Δεν	 θέλω	 να	 χαθούμε.	 And	 this	 can	 also	 be	 used	 like	 an	 expression,	
    meaning,	 “Let’s	 stay	 in	 touch”,	 or	 “Let’s	 not	 lose	 touch”.	 No?	 Δεν	 θέλω	 να	
    χαθούμε.	Like,	“I	don’t	want	that	we	lose	each	other”.		
	
	 So	 we’ve	 seen,	 in	 the	 closed	 form,	 we	 have	 our	 standard	 endings,	 no,	 and	 we	
    accent	 them.	 Θυμάμαι	 –	 θυμηθώ	 [thimáme,	 thimithó];	 θυμάσαι	 –	 θυμηθείς	
    [thimáse,	 thimithís].	 So	 we’re	 using	 our	 standard	 endings,	 no?	 We’re	 just	
    accenting	them.	But	there	is	one	exception.	For	the	“you”	plural,	we	pretty	much	
    always	use	“-είτε”	[íte],	rather	than	our	standard	“-ετε”	[ete].	But	this	is	of	course	
    fitting,	considering	we	have	the	accent	on	the	end,	in	these	closed	forms.	And	we	
    know	 that	 “-είτε”	 [íte]	 belongs	 to	 that	 realm,	 no,	 of	 their	 accents	 on	 the	 end.	
    Μπορώ	–	μπορείτε	[boró,	boríte].	So,	if	you	were	to	say,	You	guys	will	get	lost?

T:	 Κοιμάμαι.	The	closed	version?

T:	 Very	good.	Πότε	θα	κοιμηθείτε;	What	was,	I	am	scared,	I	get	scared,	I	fear	–	like	
    “phobia”?		
	
S:	 Φοβάμαι	[fováme].		
	
T:	 Φοβάμαι.	So	again,	we	don’t	have	“-ομαι”	[ome],	no?	We	have	“-άμαι”	[áme],	an	
    accented	ending	–	φοβάμαι.	So	our	closed	form	would	be	…	?		
	
S:	 Φοβηθώ	[fovithó].		
	
T:	 Φοβηθώ.	And	how	would	you	say,	Don’t	be	scared;	Don’t	fear?	What	do	we	use	
    instead	of	“δεν”	[dhen],	for	our	negative	orders,	when	we	say,	“Don’t”?

T:	 Μην.	Good.	Don’t	be	scared.	Don’t	fear.

T:	 Very	good.	Μην	φοβηθείς.	Don’t	get	scared	but	I	need	to	tell	you	something.	Don’t

S:	 Μην	φοβηθείς	αλλά	πρέπει	να	σου	πω	κάτι	[min	fovithís	alá	prépi	na	su	po	káti].

    φοβηθώ	[fovithó]	to	get	the	past,	no?	“I	got	scared”	–	we	just	have	to	add	[ik]	(ηκ),	
    before	we	add	our	past	ending.	So,	I	got	scared;	I	was	scared?		
	
S:	 Φοβήθηκα	[fovíthika].

                                                                                            548
	
T:	 So	how	would	you	say,	Where	do	you	work?		
	
S:	 Πού	εργάζεσαι;	[pu	ergházese?].		
	
T:	 Πού	 εργάζεσαι;	 So	 again,	 we	 have	 “-άζομαι”	 [ázome],	 “-άζεσαι”	 [ázese],	 which	
    means	that	our	closed	form	might	be?		
	
S:	 [ste]?		
	
T:	 So,	...	?		
	
S:	 [st]	…	something?		
	
T:	 Yeah,	maybe	it’s	better	to	look	at	another	verb,	no?	So	the	first	one	that	comes	to	
    mind	with	this	pattern?	Maybe	…	maybe,	I	imagine.		
	
S:	 Φαντάζομαι	[fandázome].		
	
T:	 Yeah.	That’s	a	…	that’s	a	easy	hook,	no?	So,	φαντάζομαι	becomes?		
	
S:	 Φανταστώ	[fandastó].		
	
T:	 Good.	 And	 that’s	 easy	 to	 move	 between,	 okay,	 φαντάζομαι	 –	 φανταστώ	
    [fandázome,	fandastó].	So,	εργάζομαι	[ergházome]	...	?		
	
S:	 Εργαστώ	[erghastó].		
	
T:	 Εργαστώ.	No?	And	you	can	actually	work	with	sound	as	well,	once	you’ve	found	
    these	patterns.	Εργαστώ.	Where	will	you	work?		
	
S:	 Πού	θα	εργαστείς;	[pu	tha	erghastís?].		
	
T:	 Πού	θα	εργαστείς;	Πού	θα	’ργαστείς;	[pu	tha’rghastís?].	And	we	said	that	we	can	
    move	very	easily	between	this	closed	form	and	the	past	–	just	before	adding	our	
    past	 ending,	 we	 add	 [ik]	 (ηκ).	 So,	 if	 you	 wanted	 to	 say,	 Where	 did	 you	 work?	 –	
    referring	to	a	closed	period	of	time.	Where	did	you	work?		
	
S:	 Πού	εργαστήθηκες;	[pu	erghastíthikes?].		
	
T:	 Εργαστήθηκες?	 You’re	 doing	 something	 twice.	 So	 go	 again	 from,	 εργαστέις	
    [erghastís].	That’s	our	closed	form;	we	said,	Πού	θα	εργαστείς;	–	“Where	will	you	
    work?”	So	how	would	you	get,	You	worked	from,	εργαστείς?	What	do	we	add	onto	
    our	closed	form,	before	we	add	on	our	past	ending?		
	
S:	 Πού	εργάστηκες;	[pu	erghástikes?].		
	


                                                                                              549
T:	 Πού	εργάστηκες;	Very	good.	So,	εργαστείς	[erghastís]	is	our	closed	form;	we	don’t	
    need	 to	 add	 [th]	 (θ)	 to	 make	 it	 closed.	 We’ve	 done	 that	 already.	 So	 to	 all	 these	
    patterns	 that	 we	 see,	 we	 will	 also	 find,	 of	 course,	 some	 important	 and	 strange	
    exceptions,	that	are	just	doing	their	own	thing.	So,	for	example,	the	verb,	I	come,	
    was?		
	
S:	 Έρχομαι	[érkhome].		
	
T:	 Έρχομαι.	The	closed	form	is,	έρθω	[értho].	Έρθω.		
	
S:	 Έρθω.		
	
T:	 And	what	do	you	notice	that’s	very	strange	about,	έρθω?		
	
S:	 The	stress	is	not	on	the	end,	but	on	the	first	syllable.		
	
T:	 Yes,	exactly.	We	don’t	have	the	accent	on	the	ending,	no?	Έρθω.	Will	you	come?		
	
S:	 Θα	έρθεις;	[tha	érthis?].		
	
T:	 Θα	έρθεις;	And	this	is	very	commonly	contracted	in	Greek	to,	Θα	’ρθείς	[thá’rthís].	
    Θα	’ρθείς.	How	would	you	say,	I	want	you	to	come?		
	
S:	 Θέλω	να	έρθεις	[thélo	na	érthis].	Θέλω	να	έρθεις.		
	
T:	 Θέλω	να	έρθεις.	Or	contracted,	Θέλω	να	’ρθείς	[thélo	ná’rthis].	Do	you	want	us	to	
    come?	Do	you	want	...	να	...	we	come?		
	
S:	 Θέλεις	να	’ρθουμε;	[thélis	ná’rthume?].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θέλεις	να	έρθουμε;	[thélis	na	érthume?].	Θέλεις	να	’ρθουμε;	And	the	
    past	“I	came”	is,	ήρθα	[írtha].	Ήρθα.	So	here	it’s	behaving	as	if	it	were	any	other	
    verb,	 no,	 to	 build	 the	 past.	 We	 don’t	 have	 any	 [ik]	 (ηκ)	 popping	 up.	 Ήρθα	 –	 “I	
    came”.		
	
S:	 	Ήρθα	[írtha].		
	
T:	 I	didn’t	come.		
	
S:	 Δεν	ήρθα	[dhen	írtha].	
	
T:	 Did	you	come?	
	
S:	 Ήρθες;	[írthes?].		
	
T:	 We	 saw	 Γεννιέμαι,	 which	 was,	 I	 am	 born,	 like	 “genetics”.	 Γίνομαι	 [yínome],	
    γίνομαι,	is	“I	become”.	So	they	sound	a	little	bit	similar,	no?	Γίνομαι	–	“I	become”.		


                                                                                                550
	
S:	 Γίνομαι.		
	
T:	 The	closed	version	of,	γίνομαι	is,	γίνω	[yíno].	Γίνω.	So	it’s	very	exceptional.	How	
    would	you	say,	I	will	become?		
	
S:	 Θα	γίνω	[tha	yíno].		
	
T:	 Θα	γίνω.	It	will	become.		
	
S:	 Θα	γίνει	[tha	yíni].		
	
T:		Θα	γίνει.	And	this	can	also	mean	like,	“It	will	happen”.	Θα	γίνει	–	It	will	happen.	
    How	would	you	say,	It	became?	Now,	you	will	treat	γίνω	[yíno]	like	any	other	verb,	
    a	normal	verb,	to	build	the	past.	Not	like	one	of	these,	you	know,	γίνομαι	[yínome]	
    verbs.	Here	it	will	behave	like	any	verb.	How	would	you	say,	It	became?		
	
S:	 Έγινε	[éyine].		
	
T:	 Έγινε.	 Good.	 And	 this	 is	 also	 used	 like	 a	 common	 expression,	 you	 know,	 if	 you	
    agree	something,	you	know,	έγινε	–	“Okay”.	Or	maybe	to	say	goodbye	also.	Έγινε,	
    like,	you	know,	“Ιt	became”,	or,	“We	close	here”	–	something	like	this.	So	we	can	
    have,	Έγινε	[éyine]	–	“It	became”,	or	“It	happened”.	So	how	would	you	say,	What	
    happened?		
	
S:	 Τι	έγινε;	[ti	éyine?].		
	
T:	 Τι	 έγινε;	 And	 “Τι	 έγινε;”	 can	 also	 be	 used	 like	 an	 expression,	 like,	 “What’s	 up?”	
    when	 you	 greet	 somebody.	 And	 also	 in	 the	 present,	 Τι	 γίνεται;	 [ti	 yínete?]	 –	
    “What’s	 going	 on?”	 “What’s	 happening?”.	 Τι	 γίνεται;	 Τι	 έγινε;	 –	 What’s	
    happening?	What	happened?	What’s	up?		
	
	 We	had,	τίποτα	[típota]	–	“nothing”.	So	you	could	say,	“Nothing	happened”,	and	
    we	 have	 a	 double	 negative	 here	 in	 Greek,	 no?	 Nothing	 didn’t	 happen.	 It	 didn’t	
    happen	nothing.		
	
S:	 Δεν	έγινε	τίποτα	[dhen	éyine	típota].		
	
T:		Δεν	έγινε	τίποτα.	So	this	is	a	very	strange	verb,	no?	Γίνομαι	[yínome],	and	then	the	
    closed	 version,	 γίνω	 [yíno].	 Building	 its	 past	 in	 a	 totally	 regular	 way	 for	 normal	
    verbs,	 not	 for	 these	 “-ομαι”	 [ome]	 verbs	 –	 έγινε	 [éyine].	 So,	 έρχομαι	 [érkhome],	
    γίνομαι	[yínome],	break	all	the	rules.		
	
	 Κάθομαι	[káthome],	κάθομαι,	means	“I	sit	down”.	Κάθομαι.		
	
S:	 Κάθομαι.		
	


                                                                                               551
T:	 The	closed	version	of,	κάθομαι	is,	καθήσω	[kathíso].		
	
S:	 Καθήσω.		
	
T:	 Or,	 κάτσω	 [kátso].	 So	 here	 we	 have	 two	 closed	 versions	 of	 the	 verb.	 They	 both	
    exist.	Καθήσω,	κάτσω	[kathíso,	kátso].	They	will	sit	here.		
	
S:	 Θα	καθήσουνε	εδώ	[tha	kathísune	edhó].		
	
T:		Θα	καθήσουν	(θα	καθήσουνε)	εδώ	[tha	kathísun	(tha	kathísune)	edhó].	And	if	you	
    want	to	say	“I	sat”,	you	will	treat,	καθήσω,	like	any	other	“-ησω”	[iso]	verb,	rather	
    than,	you	know,	using	[ik]	(ηκ).	So	how	would	you	say,	I	sat.		
	
S:	 Κάθησα	[káthisa].		
	
T:	 Κάθησα.	 And	 if	 we	 were	 to	 go	 from,	 κάτσω	 [kátso],	 that	 also	 behaves	 like	 any	
    normal	verb.	You	would	have,	έκατσα	[ékatsa].	We	sat?		
	
S:	 Καθήσαμε	[kathísame].		
	
T:	 Καθήσαμε.		Or,	κάτσαμε	[kátsame],	going	from,	κάτσω.		
	
	 You	may	hear	the	expression	in	Greek,	Στα	καλά	καθούμενα	[sta	kalá	kathúmena].	
    Στα	καλά	καθούμενα.	This	means	“out	of	the	blue”.	Out	of	the	blue.	What	do	you	
    think	is	going	on	here?	What	do	you	think	it	means,	literally	–	καλά	καθούμενα?	
    What	does,	καλά	[kalá]	mean?		
	
S:	 Good.	Well.		
	
T:	 “Good”	 or	 “well”.	 Good.	 And,	 καθούμενα?	 Try	 to	 see	 what	 type	 of	 word	 do	 you	
    think	this	is?	Do	you	think	it’s	an	adjective,	a	describing	word.	Is	it	the	verb?	Is	it	a	
    noun?	What	does	it	looks	like?		
	
S:	 Well	the	ending	seems	a	bit	like	from	“-μενος”	[menos].	So	maybe	the	…	the	state	
    of	sitting	here?		
	
T:	 Okay.		
	
S:	 So,	“Well	sat”?		
	
T:	 Well	sat.	Yes.	Well	done.	Well	done.	That’s	exactly	what	it	means.	Well	sat.	So	this	
    means,	like,	“Out	of	the	blue”,	so	it’s	kind	of	used	when	something,	you	know	like,	
    sudden	happens,	you	know,	maybe	you’re	driving	and	a	bird	falls	out	of	the	sky,	or	
    something	like	this.	And,	so	it	literally	means	like,	“Well	sat”	–	as	if	the	things	were	
    there,	sitting	there	waiting	for	you	to	come,	out	of	the	blue,	you	know.	They	were	
    there	…	there	in	place.	Very	good.

Teacher:	What	was,	I	lose?		
	
Student:	Χάνω	[kháno].		
	
T:	 Χάνω.	Good.	And,	I	was	losing?		
	
S:	 Έχασα	[ékhasa].		
	
T:	 So	not,	“I	lost”	but,	“I	was	losing”.	We	…	we	don’t	need	to	go	to	the	closed	form	
    for	this.	No?		
	
S:	 Έχανα	[ékhana].		
	
T:	 Έχανα.		
	
S:	 Έχανα.		
	
T:	 Good.	What	was	the	word	for,	woman?		
	
S:	 Γυναίκα	[yinéka].		
	
T:	 Γυναίκα.	You	know	“misogyny”	in	English?	What	does	it	mean?		
	
S:	 Um.	Someone	who	hates	women.		
	
T:	 Yeah.	No?	Someone	that	hates	women;	a	woman	hater;	a	misogynist.	The	“-gyny”	
    bit	there	is	like,	γυναίκα;	and	[misó]	in	Greek	(μισώ),	means	“I	hate”.	Μισώ.		
	
S:	 Μισώ.		
	
T:	 How	would	you	say,	They	hate?		
	
S:	 Μισούν	[misún].		
	
T:	 Μισούν.	If	you	want	to	say	something	like,	“They	hate	one	another”,	you	can	say,	
    Μισούν	ο	ένας	τον	άλλο	[misún	o	énas	ton	álo].	Μισούν	ο	ένας	τον	άλλο.	So,	“Ο	
    ένας	 τον	 άλλο”	 is	 like	 an	 expression,	 “one	 to	 the	 other”.	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say	
    that?	They	hate	each	other?		
	
S:	 Μισούν	ο	ένας	τον	άλλο	[misún	o	énas	ton	álo].		
	
T:	 Good.	Μισούν	ο	ένας	τον	άλλο.	And	you	could	also	hear,	Μισούν	ο	ένας	τον	άλλον	
    [misún	o	énas	ton	álon].	So	we	have,	μισώ,	which	is	“I	hate”,	with	the	accent	on	
    the	end.	So	what	would	be	the	closed	version	of,	μισώ.		
	


                                                                                             553
S:	 Μισήσω	[misíso].		
	
T:	 Μισήσω.	And,	I	hated?	Hated.		
	
S:	 Μίσησα	[mísisa].		
	
T:	 Μίσησα.	So	that’s,	I	hated.	If	you	want	to	say	“I	was	hating”,	or	“I	used	to	hate”;	
    with	 these	 verbs,	 no,	 with	 their	 accent	 on	 the	 end,	 we	 have	 a	 different	 way	 of	
    going	into	this	open	past.	We	don’t	go	from,	μισώ	[misó].	What	do	we	do	to	say,	I	
    used	to	hate,	I	was	hating?		
	
S:	 We	add	the	“-ούσα”	[úsa].		
	
T:	 Mmm.	Good.		
	
S:	 So	it	would	be,	μισούσα	[misúsa].		
	
T:	 Μισούσα.	Good.	So	we	have	“ους”	[us]	instead	of	“ης”	[is],	like	in	the	closed	form,	
    but	we	also	accent	that	“ους”.	Μισούσα.		So	 we’ve	 seen	 how,	 with	 these	 verbs,	
    with	their	accent	on	the	end,	like	μισώ,	like	μιλαώ	[miláo],	for	example,	we	have	a	
    different	way	of	forming	our	open	past.	And	the	same	goes	for	our	“-ομαι”	[ome],	
    “-άμαι”	[ame],	“-έσαι”	[ese]	verbs.	For	this	type	of	verb,	we	also	have	a	different	
    way	of	forming	our	open,	ongoing	past.	What	was,	I	am?		
	
S:	 Είμαι	[íme].		
	
T:	 Είμαι.	And,	I	was?		
	
S:	 Ήμουν	[ímun].		
	
T:	 Ήμουν.	 Good.	 Or,	 ήμουνα	 [ímuna],	 we	 could	 have	 as	 well:	 ήμουν,	 ήμουνα.	 You	
    are?		
	
S:	 Είσαι	[íse].		
	
T:	 Είσαι.	And,	You	were?		
	
S:	 Ήσουν	[ísun].		
	
T:	 Ήσουν,	 ήσουνα	 [ísuna].	 We	 had,	 He/she/it	 is,	 and	 also,	 They	 are;	 all	 the	 same	
    word.		
	
S:	 Είναι	[íne].		
	
T:	 Είναι.	And	the	past	of,	είναι?	It	was,	She	was,	He	was,	They	were?		
	
S:	 Ήταν	[ítan].		


                                                                                             554
	
T:	 Ήταν.	Or,	ήτανε	[ítane],	we	could	have.	The	plural,	You	are,	was	είστε	[íste].	So	we	
    had,	είσαι	[íse]	and,	είστε	[íste].		
	
S:	 Είστε.		
	
T:	 And	the	past	of,	είστε	–	ήσασταν	[ísastan].	Ήσασταν.	How	would	you	say,	Where	
    were	you	guys?		
	
S:	 Πού	ήσασταν;	[pu	ísastan?].		
	
T:	 Πού	ήσασταν;	What	is,	We	are?		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	[ímaste].		
	
T:	 We	are	–	είμαστε.	Good.	The	past	of,	είμαστε	is,	ήμασταν	[ímastan].	Ήμασταν.		
	
S:	 Ήμασταν.		
	
T:	 So	 we	 have	 these	 two	 very	 similar	 pasts,	 no?	 Ήσασταν,	 for	 “you”	 plural,	 and	
    ήμασταν,	for	“we”;	“we	were”.	We	were	here.		
	
S:	 Ήμασταν	εδώ	[ímastan	edhó].		
	
T:	 Ήμασταν	εδώ.	So	we’ve	seen	how	“-ομαι”	[ome],	“-εσαι”	[ese],	etc.,	is	very	much	
    like	the	verb	“to	be”	in	the	present.	Χάνομαι	[khánome]	is	like,	χάνω	[kháno]	and	
    είμαι	[íme].	What	was,	I	was,	the	past	of,	είμαι?		
	
S:	 Ήμουν	[ímun].		
	
T:	 Ήμουν.	 If	 we	 want	 to	 say	 “I	 was	 getting	 lost”,	 instead	 of	 “I	 am	 getting	 lost”	 –	
    χάνομαι,	 instead	 of	 adding	 “-ομαι”,	 which	 is	 like,	 είμαι,	 we	 will	 add	 “-όμουν”	
    [ómun],	which	is	like,	ήμουν	[ímun],	and	you	accent	the	[o]	of	“-όμουν”.	So,	I	was	
    getting	lost?		
	
S:	 Χανόμουν	[khanómun].		
	
T:	 Χανόμουν.	Good.	So	we	have,	χάνομαι	with	“-ομαι”,	that’s	like,	είμαι,	no	–	“I	get	
    lost”;	and,	χανόμουν	with	“-όμουν”	which	is	like,	ήμουν	–	“I	was	getting	lost”.		
	
	 So	maybe	“I	was	getting	lost”	is	not	such	a	common	thing	to	say,	but	we	know,	we	
    also	form	the	“would”	time	with	“θα”	and	this	open	past.	So	maybe	you	want	to	
    say	something	like	“I	would	get	lost”.	So	if	we	have,	χανόμουν,	how	is,	I	would	get	
    lost?		
	
S:	 Θα	χανόμουν	[tha	khanómun].		
	


                                                                                               555
T:	 Θα	χανόμουν	or,	θα	χανόμουνα	[tha	khanómuna]	–	also,	we	could	have.		
	
	 So	 we	 get	 “-όμουν”	 from	 “ήμουν”	 and	 from	 “ήσουν”	 we	 get	 “-όσουν”.	 So	 our	
    ending	for	“you”	in	this	open	past	is	“-όσουν”.	So	how	would	you	say,	You	would	
    get	lost?		
	
S:	 Θα	χανόσουν	[tha	khanósun].		
	
T:	 Θα	χανόσουν.	What	was,	I	think?		
	
S:	 Σκέφτομαι	[skéftome].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτομαι.	I	was	thinking?		
	
S:	 Σκεφτόμουν	[skeftómun].		
	
T:	 Σκεφτόμουν.	Good.	You	were	thinking.		
	
S:	 Σκεφτόσουν	[skeftósun].		
	
T:	 Σκεφτόσουν.	What	were	you	thinking?	What	were	you	thinking	about?		
	
S:	 Τι	σκεφτόσουν;	[ti	skeftósun?].		
	
T:	 What	were	you	thinking	about?	Τι	σκεπτόσουν;	What	was,	I	need?		
	
S:	 Χρειάζομαι	[khriázome].		
	
T:	 Χρειάζομαι.	And	the	closed	version	of,	χρειάζομαι?	We	had	a	pattern	with	those	
    that	have	“-άζομαι”	[ázome].	They	become	…	?		
	
S:	 “-στώ”	[sto].

S:	 Χρειαστώ	[khriastó].		
	
T:	 Χρειαστώ.	 How	 would	 you	 say,	 I	 needed?	 So	 for	 “I	 needed”,	 rather	 than	 “I	 was	
    needing”,	no?	I	needed.	What	do	we	add	to	the	closed	form	to	get	this	past?		
	
S:	 Was	it	“ηκα”	[ika]?

    open,	ongoing	time:	“was	needing”	or	“needed	over	many	times”.	So	how	would	
    you	say	that	–	I	was	needing?	
	
S:	 Χρειαστόμουν	[khriastómun].		
	
T:		So	 we	 don’t	 want	 to	 go	 back	 to,	 χρειαστώ,	 no?	 That’s	 the	 closed	 form.	 We	 just	
    need	to	go	back	to,	χρειάζομαι.	And	instead	of	“-ομαι”	[ome],	use	...	?		
	
S:	 “-όμουν”	[ómun].		
	
T:	 “-όμουν”.	 Χρειαζόμουν	 [khriazómun].	 What	 did	 you	 need?	 What	 were	 you	
    needing?	Or,	What	were	you	in	need	of?		
	
S:	 Τι	χρειαζόσουν;	[ti	khriazósun?].		
	
T:	 Τι	χρειαζόσουν;	But	if	you	wanted	to	say,	What	did	you	need,	as	a	closed	period	of	
    time	–	this	is	very	different,	and	the	thinking	process	is	very	different	as	well,	to	
    find	it.	What	did	you	need?		
	
S:	 Τι	χρειάστηκες;	[ti	khriástikes?].

Teacher:	What	was,	He	is,	She	is,	It	is?		
	
Student:	Είναι	[íne].		
	
T:	 Είναι.	 Good.	 And	 with	 this	 type	 of	 verb	 that	 we’re	 looking	 at:	 νοικιάζεται	
    [nikiázete]	–	“for	rent”,	σκέφτεται	[skéftete]	–	“he/she	thinks”,	the	ending	“-εται”	
    [ete],	doesn’t	look	too	much	like,	είναι	[íne],	apart	from	the	fact	that	that	final	E	
    ([e])	 is	 spelt	 AI	 (αι),	 just	 like,	 είναι.	 But	 also	 we	 have	 the	 T	 (τ)	 there,	 no,	 like	
    representing	“την,	τον,	το”	[tin,	ton,	to].	So,	He	needs,	She	needs,	It	needs?		
	
S:	 Χρειάζεται	[khriázete].		
	
T:	 Χρειάζεται.	And	what	was,	He	was,	She	was,	It	was?		
	
S:	 Ήταν	[ítan].		
	
T:	 Ήταν.	Or,	ήτανε	[ítane],	we	could	also	have.	“He	was	needing”,	“She	was	needing”,	
    or	“	…	was	in	need	of”	is,	χρειαζόταν	[khriazótan].	Χρειαζόταν.		
	
S:	 Χρειαζόταν.		
	
T:	 Or,	 χρειαζότανε	 [khriazótane],	 just	 like	 we	 have,	 ήταν	 [ítan]	 or	 ήτανε	 [ítane].	
    Χρειαζόταν.	Χρειαζότανε.	So	this	“-όταν”	ending	looks	much	more	like	“ήταν”	than	
    we	 have	 in	 the	 present	 between	 “-εται”	 [ete]	 and	 “είναι”	 [íne],	 no?	 Χρειαζόταν.	
    He	(or,	she)	needed	it	(was	in	need	of	it)?		
	
S:	 Το	χρειαζόταν	[to	khriazótan].		
	
T:	 Το	χρειαζόταν.	Το	χρειαζότανε	[to	khriazótane].	He	was	going	to	need	it.	She	was	
    going	to	need	it	(or,	would	need	it).		
	
S:	 Θα	το	χρειαζόταν	[tha	to	khriazótan].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Θα	το	χρειαζόταν.	What	was,	They	were?		
	
S:	 Ήτανε	[ítane].		
	
T:	 Ήταν	[ítan].	Ήτανε.	The	same,	no?	But	we	do	differentiate	this	with	the	verbs.	No?	
    We	don’t	use	the	same	endings	for,	he/she	and	it,	and	they,	even	though	“είναι”	
    and	 ”ήταν”	 represents	 all	 of	 those	 people.	 So	 in	 the	 present,	 we	 have,	 for	
    example,	χρειάζεται	[khriázete]	and,	χρειάζονται	[khriázonde],	for	“he	needs”	and	
    “they	need”.	And	in	the	open	past	we	have,	χρειαζόταν	[khriazótan]	for	“he	was	in	
    need	of”	and,	χρειάζονταν	[khriázondan],	χρειάζονταν,	for	“they	were	in	need	of”.	
    So	we	get	an	N	(ν),	no?	Instead	of	“-όταν”	[ótan],	“-ονταν”	[ondan],	but	also	we	



                                                                                                    558
   move	the	accent,	to	make	these	sound	more	dissimilar	as	well.	Χρειαζόταν	–	“he	
   needed”.	Χρειάζονταν	–	“they	needed”,	in	our	open	past.		
	
	 What	was,	I	think?		
	
S:	 Σκέφτομαι	[skéftome].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτομαι.		He	thinks?		
	
S:	 Σκέφτεται	[skéftete].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτεται.	He	was	thinking.		
	
S:	 Σκεφτόταν	[skeftótan].		
	
T:	 Σκεφτόταν.	 And	 for,	 They	 were	 thinking,	 instead	 of	 “-όταν”	 [ótan],	 we	 will	 have	
    “-ονταν”;	but	also	we	don’t	accent	that.	We	move	the	accent	one	behind	as	well,	
    to	make	them	sound	more	different.	So,	They	were	thinking?		
	
S:	 Σκέφτονταν	[skéftondan].		
	
T:	 Σκέφτονταν.	How	would	you	say,	What	were	they	in	need	of?	What	did	they	need?		
	
S:	 Τι	χρειάζονταν;	[ti	khriázondan?].		
	
T:	 Τι	χρειάζονταν;	What	would	they	need?	What	would	they	need?		
	
S:	 Τι	χρειά	...	Τι	θα	χρειάζονταν	[ti	tha	khriázondan?].		
	
T:	 Τι	θα	χρειάζονταν.		How	was,	I	get	lost?		
	
S:	 Χάνομαι	[khánome].		
	
T:	 Χάνομαι.	I	was	getting	lost.		
	
S:	 Χάθηκα	[kháthika].	Χάνονται	[khánonde].		
	
T:	 So	don’t	guess.	All	you	need	to	do	is	to	look	at	what	we	have	for	“I	was”.	What	is,	I	
    was?		
	
S:	 Ήμουν	[ímun].		
	
T:	 Ήμουν.	So,	I	was	getting	lost?		
	
S:	 Χανόμουν	[khanómun].		
	
T:	 Χανόμουν.	Χανόμουνα	[khanómuna].	Very	good.	You	were	getting	lost?		


                                                                                           559
	
S:	 Χανόσουν	[khanósun].		
	
T:	 Χανόσουν.	He	(or,	she)	was	getting	lost?	It	was	getting	lost?		
	
S:	 Χανόταν	[khánotan].		
	
T:	 Χανόταν.	And,	They	were	getting	lost.		
	
S:	 Χανόνταν	[khanótan].	
	
T:	 That	 sounds	 far	 too	 much	 like,	 χανόταν.	 So	 what	 do	 we	 do	 to	 make	 that	 sound	
    more	different?		
	
S:	 Χάνονταν	[khánondan].		
	
T:	 Χάνονταν.	So	that’s,	They	were	getting	 lost.	And	how	would	we	say,	They	would	
    get	lost;	They	were	going	to	get	lost?		
	
S:	 Θα	χανον	...	Θα	χάνονταν	[tha	khánondan].		
	
T:	 Θα	 χάνονταν.	 So	 we	 have,	 χάνονταν,	 with	 a	 different	 accent	 to,	 χανόταν,	 which	
    helps	 to	 make	 them	 sound	 more	 different.	 But	 we	 also	 have	 another	 form	 for	
    “they”	 in	 our	 open	 past	 for	 these	 types	 of	 verbs.	 Instead	 of	 “χάνονταν”	 for	
    example,	we	could	also	have,	χανόντουσαν	[khanóndusan].	Χανόντουσαν.	So	you	
    don’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about	 producing	 that,	 but	 you	 may	 hear	 it.	 What	 was,	 I	
    imagine,	like	“fantasy”?		
	
S:	 Φαντάζομαι	[fandázome].		
	
T:	 Φαντάζομαι.	I	was	imagining.		
	
S:	 Φανταζόμουν	[fandazómun].		
	
T:	 Φανταζόμουν.	He	imagines.		
	
S:	 Φαντάζεται	[fandázete].		
	
T:	 Φαντάζεται.	He	was	imagining.		
	
S:	 Φανταζόταν	[fandazótan].		
	
T:	 Φανταζόταν.	They	imagine.	Again,	back	to	the	present.	They	imagine.		
	
S:	 Φαντάζονται	[fandázonde].		
	



                                                                                          560
T:	 Good.	Φαντάζονται.	So,	you	know,	we’re	seeing	a	lot	of	forms,	but	all	we	need	to	
    do	is	go	back	and	look	at	the	verb	“to	be”,	to	be	reminded.	So	even	though	“they	
    are”,	is	just,	είναι,	even	that	[e]	(αι)	at	the	end	of	είναι,	helps	us	remember	that	
    we	 have,	 φαντάζονται,	 and	 not	 the	 very	 similar	 sounding	 “-ονταν”	 [ondan],	 for	
    example,	which	is	for,	ήταν	[ítan],	no,	for	that	open	past.	They	were	imagining?		
	
S:	 Φαντάζονταν	[fandázondan].		
	
T:	 Φαντάζονταν.	 And	 as	 I	 mentioned,	 we	 also	 have	 this	 alternative	 form,	
    φανταζόντουσαν	 [fandazóndusan].	 Φανταζόντουσαν,	 which	 you	 don’t	 need	 to	
    worry	 about	 building,	 no?	 We	 can	 continue	 building	 in	 the	 way	 that	 we’ve	 been	
    doing,	 looking	 back	 to	 the	 verb,	 “to	 be”.	 But,	 you	 know,	 you	 will	 hear	 that	
    alternative	form,	and	maybe	some	others	as	well.	So	if	you	notice,	you	know,	that	
    an	alternative	form	is	especially	more	heard	than	the	one	you’re	using,	feel	free	to	
    pick	it	up.	But	for	now,	for	building,	we	want	to	look	back	to	the	verb,	“to	be”,	for	
    the	present	and	the	open	past.	You	imagine	–	in	the	present.	You	imagine.		
	
S:	 Φαντάζεις	[fandázis].	Φαντάζεσαι	[fandázese].		
	
T:	 Φαντάζεσαι	[fandázese].	You	were	imagining?		
	
S:	 Φανταόσουν	[fandazósun].		
	
T:	 Φανταόσουν.	What	was,	I	sleep?		
	
S:	 Κοιμάμαι	[kimáme].		
	
T:	 Κοιμάμαι.	 So	 this	 κοιμάμαι	 has	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 ending,	 and	 it’s	 also	 “-άμαι”	
    [áme],	no?	But	that	doesn’t	cause	any	problem	when	we	build,	for	example,	“I	was	
    sleeping”.	We	still	use	“όμουν”	[ómun].	So	how	would	that	be	–	I	was	sleeping?		
	
S:	 Κοιμόμουν	[kimómun].		
	
T:	 Κοιμόμουν.	Were	you	sleeping?	Were	you	sleeping?		
	
S:	 Κοιμόσουν;	[kimósun?].		
	
T:	 Κοιμόσουν;	He	was	sleeping.		
	
S:	 Κοιμόταν	[kimótan].		
	
T:	 Κοιμόταν.	 We	 just	 look	 back	 to,	 ήταν,	 no,	 and	 we	 get,	 κοιμόταν.	 They	 were	
    sleeping?		
	
S:	 Κοιμόταν	[kimótan].		
	



                                                                                           561
T:	 So	how	do	we	differentiate	“-όταν”	from	“ήταν”,	and	the	ending	that	we	have	for	
    “they”?	What	do	we	add	to	it?	The	sound	that	we	generally	have	for	“they”?		
	
S:	 An	N	(ν).		
	
T:	 An	N.	So	what	does	“όταν”	become?	
	
S:	 “-ονταν”	[ondan].		
	
T:	 “-ονταν”.	 And	 actually	 here	 with	 κοιμάμαι,	 that	 takes	 the	 accent	 on	 the	 ending,	
    with	the	“they”	form,	we	won’t	see	the	accent	move.	It’s	going	to	be	on	“-όνταν”.	
    So,	They	were	sleeping.		
	
S:	 Κοιμόνταν	[kimóndan].		
	
T:		Κοιμόνταν.	In	the	present	for	κοιμάμαι,	we	get,	κοιμούνται	[kimúnde]	instead	of	
    “-όνται”.	Κοιμούνται.	So	with,	κοιμάμαι,	we	have,	κοιμούνται,	no,	for	“they”,	and	
    we	always	want	to,	you	know,	try	to	make	our	own	patterns.	 So,	okay,	we	have	
    “άμαι”	going	to,	κοιμούνται,	so	we	might	also	try	that	with,	φοβάμαι	[fováme]	–	
    “I’m	scared”.	So	how	might,	They’re	scared,	be?		
	
S:	 Φοβούνται	[fovúnde].		
	
T:	 Φοβούνται.	And	we	saw	that	expression,	ο	ένας	τον	άλλο	[o	énas	ton	álo],	to	say	
    “one	 to	 the	 other”,	 “each	 other”,	 or	 “of	 each	 other”.	 So	 how	 would	 you	 say,	
    They’re	scared	of	each	other?		
	
S:	 Φοβούνται	ο	ένας	τον	άλλο	[fovúnde	o	énas	ton	álo].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Φοβούνται	ο	ένας	τον	άλλο.	And,	They	were	scared,	as	an	open	past?		
	
S:	 Φοβόνταν	[fovóndan].		
	
T:		Φοβόνταν.	 Good.	 And	 again	 we	 have	 the	 accent	 here	 on	 “-όνταν”	 [óndan],	 just	
    like	 with,	 κοιμόνταν,	 because	 κοιμάμαι	 and	 φοβάμαι	 have	 their	 accent	 on	 the	
    end.	What	was,	We	are?		
	
S:	 Είμαστε	[ímaste].		
	
T:	 Είμαστε.	And,	We	were?		
	
S:	 Ήμασταν	[ímastan].		
	
T:	 Ήμασταν.	So	what	might	we	have	for	our	ending	for	this	open,	ongoing	past,	if	we	
    went	 from	 “ήμουν”	 to	 “-όμουν”,	 “ήσουν”	 to	 “-όσουν”;	 we	 might	 go	 from	
    “ήμασταν”	to	...	?		
	


                                                                                           562
S:	 “-όμασταν”	[ómastan].		
	
T:		“-όμασταν”.	Good.	How	would	you	say,	We	were	sleeping?	We	were	sleeping.		
	
S:	 Κοιμόμασταν	[kimómastan].		
	
T:	 Κοιμόμασταν.	We	would	sleep;	or,	We	were	going	to	sleep.		
	
S:	 Θα	κοιμόμασταν	[tha	kimómastan].		
	
T:	 Θα	κοιμόμασταν.	What	was,	You	are,	the	formal,	or	the	plural?	Εσείς	[esís]	...	?		
	
S:	 Είστε	[íste].		
	
T:	 Eσείς	είστε	[esís	íste].	So	we	have,	είστε,	for	“you	are”	(formal	or	plural).	And	the	
    past,	which	is	very	similar	to	“ήμασταν”,	is	...	?		
	
S:	 Ήσασταν	[ísastan].		
	
T:	 Ήσασταν.	You	were;	You	guys	were.	Where	were	you	guys?	
	
S:	 Πού	ήσασταν;	[pu	ísastan?].		
	
T:	 Πού	ήσασταν;	So	what	ending	might	we	expect	for	our	open	past,	for	“εσείς”,	for	
    “you”	plural	or	formal,	if	we	have	“ήσασταν”.		
	
S:	 “-όσασταν”	[ósastan].		
	
T:	 “-όσασταν”.	I	get	lost.	How	is,	I	get	lost?		
	
S:	 Χάνομαι	[khánome].		
	
T:	 Χάνομαι.	You	guys	are	getting	lost.		
	
S:	 Χάνεστε	[kháneste].		
	
T:	 Χάνεστε.	Very	good.	Χάνεστε.	How	would	you	say,	You	guys	were	getting	lost?		
	
S:	 Χανόσασταν	[khanósastan].		
	
T:	 Χανόσασταν.	Good.	You	would	get	lost.	You	guys	would	get	lost.		
	
S:	 Θα	χανόσασταν	[tha	khanósastan].		
	
T:	 Θα	χανόσασταν.	And	what	was	the	closed	version	of,	χάνομαι?		
	
S:	 Χαθώ	[khathó].		


                                                                                     563
	
T:	 Χαθώ.	Good.	So	from,	χαθώ,	we	can	find	the	past	easily,	no,	our	standard	“I	got	
    lost”,	rather	than	“I	was	getting	lost”.	All	we	have	to	do	is	to	add	[ik]	(ηκ).	So,	I	got	
    lost?		
	
S:	 Χάθηκα	[kháthika].		
	
T:	 Χάθηκα.	You	guys	got	lost.		
	
S:	 Χαθήκατε	[khathíkate].		
	
T:	 Χαθήκατε.	Very	good.	What	is,	You	guys	have?	Just,	You	guys	have.		
	
S:	 Έχετε	[échete].		
	
T:	 Έχετε.	Have	you	got	lost?	Have	you	got	lost?	So	now	we	need,	“got	lost”.	But	we	
    know	how	to	find	that	“have”	past.		
	
S:	 Έχετε	χάθει	[échete	kháthi].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	where	does	the	accent	go?	On	“χα...	”.		
	
S:	 Χαθεί	[khathí].		
	
T:	 Good.	Έχετε	χαθεί	[échete	khathí].	You	guys	have	got	lost.	So	we	know	how	to	find	
    that,	no?	We	go	from	the	closed	form,	χαθώ,	and	put	it	in	he/she/it	form	–	χαθεί.	
    Έχω	χαθεί	[ékho	khathí],	έχετε	χαθεί.	If	we	want	to	say,	You	had	got	lost,	You	had	
    got	lost	–	then	we	just	need	the	past	of,	έχετε.	So	“I	had”	was,	είχα	[íkha].	So	how	
    would,	You	guys	had,	be?		
	
S:	 Είχατε	[íkhate].		
	
T:	 Είχατε.	You	guys	had	got	lost.		
	
S:	 Είχατε	χαθεί	[íkhate	khathí].		
	
T:	 Είχατε	χαθεί.	And	we	can	get,	You	would	have	got	lost.	No?	What	do	we	add	to,	
    είχατε	–	You	had,	to	get,	You	would	have?		
	
S:	 Θα	[tha].		
	
T:	 Good.	So,	You	would	have	got	lost?	Still	plural.

T:	 Χάνομαι.	I	was	getting	lost.		
	
S:	 Χανόμουν	[khanómun].		
	
T:	 Χανόμουν.	We	were	getting	lost.		
	
S:	 Χαν	...	Χανόμασταν	[khanómastan].		
	
T:	 Good.	Χανόμασταν.	And	the	closed	version	of,	χάνομαι	–	how	is	it?		
	
S:	 Χαθώ	[khathó].		
	
T:	 Χαθώ.	So	how	would	you	say,	We	have	got	lost?	We	have	got	lost.		
	
S:	 Έχουμε	χαθεί	[ékhume	khathí].		
	
T:	 Έχουμε	χαθεί.	We	had	got	lost.	
	
S:	 Είχαμε	χαθεί	[íkhame	khathí].		
	
T:	 Είχαμε	χαθεί.	We	would	have	got	lost.	We	would	have	got	lost.		
	
S:	 Θα	είχαμε	χαθεί	[tha	íkhame	khathí].		
	
T:	 Θα	είχαμε	χαθεί.	We	would	have	got	lost.		
	
	 If	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 “Don’t	 get	 lost”	 (this	 can	 be	 used	 like,	 “Stay	 in	 touch”,	 you	
    know,	“Don’t	get	lost”),	you	can	say,	Μην	χαθείς	[min	khathís].	Μην	χαθείς.		
	
S:	 Μην	χαθείς.		
	
T:	 Or	 you	 could	 also	 say,	 Μην	 χάνεσαι	 [min	 khánese].	 This	 “Don’t	 get	 lost”,	 in	 the	
    sense	 of,	 “Stay	 in	 touch”,	 that’s	 open	 and	 ongoing,	 maybe.	 So	 you	 could	 hear	
    either.	 So	 with	 this	 we	 see	 the	 negative	 orders,	 with	 this	 type	 of	 verb	 like	
    “χάνομαι”,	 is	 pretty	 standard	 –	 	 what	 we	 would	 expect	 to	 do.	 After	 “Μην”,	 we	
    have	to	decide	whether	we	want	the	open	or	closed	form.	So	how	would	you	say	
    that	to	more	than	one	person,	or	formally?	Don’t	get	lost.		


                                                                                               565
	
S:	 Μην	χάθετε	[min	kháthete].		
	
T:	 Good.	But	with,	χαθώ	[khathó],	we	have	the	accent	on	the	end.	No?		
	
S:	 Μην	χαθέτε	[min	khathéte].		
	
T:	 And	it	would	be,	μην	χαθέτε,	but	because	we	have	the	accent	on	the	end,	what	
    happens	to	“-έτε”	[ete]?		
	
S:	 Μην	χαθείτε	[min	khathíte].		
	
T:	 We	 get	 “-είτε”.	 So	 this	 is	 the	 only	 change	 that	 we	 have	 with	 the	 endings	 in	 the	
    closed	forms.	No?	Like	in,	χαθώ.	Everything	else	is	what	we	would	expect:	χαθώ,	
    χαθείς,	 χαθεί,	 χαθούμε.	 No?	 But	 with	 “you”	 (plural),	 we	 get,	 χαθείτε,	 which	 we	
    mentioned	was	very	fitting,	considering	that	we	have	the	accent	on	the	end	there.	
    And	 we	 know	 “-είτε”	 really	 belongs	 to	 that	 realm.	 So	 you	 would	 have,	 Μην	
    χαθείτε,	for	“Don’t	get	lost”,	plurally.		
	
	 So	 as	 we	 see,	 the	 negative	 command	 is	 pretty	 straightforward,	 no?	 We	 just	 use	
    “μην”,	like	with	the	other	verbs,	and	then	choose	what	form	of	the	verb	that	we	
    want.	 Mostly	we	will	build	this	 with	the	closed	form.	So	how	would	you	say,	for	
    example,	you	know,	Don’t	think?	You	need	to	find	the	closed	form	of,	Σκέφτομαι.		
	
S:	 Σκεφτώ	[skeftó].		
	
T:	 Σκεφτώ.	That’s	the	closed	form.	Good.	So,	Don’t	think?		
	
S:	 Μην	σκεφτείς	[min	skeftís].		
	
T:	 Μην	σκεφτείς.	Αnd	to	more	than	one	person?		
	
S:	 Μην	σκεφτείτε	[min	skeftíte].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μην	σκεφτείτε.	We	have,	κοιμάμαι.	For	“-άμαι”	[áme],	for	these	verbs	
    that	have	their	accent	on	the	ending,	we	have	an	easy	way	to	get	the	closed	form.		
	
S:	 Κοιμηθώ	[kimithó].		
	
T:	 Κοιμηθώ.	Good.	We	have	[ith]	(ηθ),	no?	Κοιμηθώ.	Don’t	sleep.		
	
S:	 Μην	κοιμηθείς	[min	kimithís].		
	
T:	 Μην	κοιμηθείς.	So	I	said	mostly	we’d	have	the	closed	version,	no,	with	this	kind	of	
    orders.	Μην	κοιμηθείς.	Don’t	sleep,	like,	now.	And	to	more	than	one	person?		
	
S:	 Μην	κοιμηθείτε	[min	kimithíte].		


                                                                                               566
	
T:	 Μην	κοιμηθείτε.	The	positive	command	…	the	positive	command	with	these	verbs	
    like,	φαντάζομαι	[fandázome],	κοιμάμαι,	sees	other	forms,	mostly	with	“σου”	[su]	
    on	 the	 end.	 So	 we	 have,	 φαντάζομαι	 –	 “I	 imagine”;	 and	 the	 closed	 version	 of,	
    φαντάζομαι,	is?		
	
S:	 Φανταστώ	[fandastó].		
	
T:	 Φανταστώ.	And	then,	Imagine,	as	an	order	is,	φαντάσου	[fandásu].	Φαντάσου.		
	
S:	 Φαντάσου.		
	
T:	 But	this	is	only	for	the	singular,	this	strange,	φαντάσου.	If	we	are	talking	to	more	
    than	one	person,	you	will	just	go	from	the	closed	form	and	add	“-είτε”.	So,	how	
    would	you	say,	to	more	than	one	person	–	Imagine?			
	
S:	 Φανταστείτε	[fandastíte].		
	
T:	 Φανταστείτε.	Good.	For,	Think!	–	to	give	an	order,	so	from,	σκέφτομαι,	we	have,	
    σκέψου	[sképsu].	Σκέψου.		
	
S:	 Σκέψου.		
	
T:	 Think	about	it!		
	
S:	 Σκέψου	το	[sképsu	to].		
	
T:	 Σκέψου	το.	Good.	So	with	these	positive	commands,	no,	we	have	words	like	“το”	
    after	the	verb.	Σκέψου	το.	And	the	closed	version	of,	σκέφτομαι,	is?		
	
S:	 Σκεφτώ.		
	
T:	 Σκεφτώ.	So	if	you	say,	Think,	to	more	than	one	person,	you	say	...	?		
	
S:	 Σκεφτείτε	[skeftíte].		
	
T:	 Σκεφτείτε.	Think	about	it.		
	
S:	 Σκεφτείτε	το	[skeftíte	to].		
	
T:	 Σκεφτείτε	το.	Good.	So	we	have	quite	a	difference,	no,	between,	σκέψου,	for	one	
    person	 and,	 σκεφτείτε,	 addressing	 more	 than	 one	 person,	 or	 being	 formal,	 or	
    polite.	Σκεφτείτε	–	Think!		
	
	 We	had	“I	sleep”	–	κοιμάμαι.	And	the	order,	the	positive	order	to	one	person	is,	
    κοιμήσου	[kimísu].	Κοιμήσου.		
	


                                                                                          567
S:	 Kοιμήσου.		
	
T:	 Kοιμήσου.	So,	you	know,	you	kind	of	really	need	to	hear	these	in	context;	they’re	
    a	 bit	 all	 over	 the	 place,	 no	 –	 φαντάσου,	 σκέψου,	 κοιμήσου	 [fandásu,	 sképsu,	
    kimísu].	But	then	the	formal,	or	the	plural	order,	is	much	easier	to	find.	We	just	go	
    from	the	closed	versions.	So	we	have,	κοιμάμαι,	and	its	closed	form	is?		
	
S:	 Κοιμηθώ	[kimithó].		
	
T:	 Κοιμηθώ.	And	then	if	you	tell	more	than	one	person	to	sleep.		
	
S:	 Κοιμηθείτε	[kimithíte].		
	
T:	 Κοιμηθείτε.	Sleep	now.		
	
S:	 Κοιμηθείτε	τώρα	[kimithíte	tóra].		
	
T:	 Κοιμηθείτε	τώρα.	Don’t	sleep	now.		
	
S:	 Μην	κοιμηθείτε	τώρα	[min	kimithíte	tóra].		
	
T:	 Μην	κοιμηθείτε	τώρα.	And	to	one	person.	Don’t	sleep.		
	
S:	 Μην	κοιμηθείς	[min	kimithís].		
	
T:	 Μην	κοιμηθείς.	Good.	Don’t	sleep.	Μην	κοιμηθείς.	The	word	for	“ready”	in	Greek	
    is,	έτοιμος	[étimos].	Έτοιμος.		
	
S:	 Έτοιμος	[étimos].		
	
T:	 And	you’ll	hear	this	used,	like,	you	know,	“Are	you	ready?”	–	Έτοιμος;	Έτοιμη;	So	
    we	 have,	 έτοιμος	 for	 “ready”	 or	 “prepared”.	 Αnd,	 ετοιμάζω,	 is	 “I	 ready”	 or	 “I	
    prepare”	 –	 ετοιμάζω.	 But	 if	 we	 use	 “-ομαι”	 instead	 of	 [ο]	 (ω):	 ετοιμάζομαι	 –	 “I	
    prepare	myself”,	“I	prepare	me”,	you	say	“I	get	ready”.	Ετοιμάζομαι	[etimázome].		
	
S:	 Ετοιμάζομαι.		
	
T:	 Ετοιμάζομαι.	So,	apart	from	“έτοιμος”,	what	do	you	notice	there	that’s	familiar	in,	
    ετοιμάζομαι?		
	
S:	 “-ζομαι”	[zome].		
	
T:	 Good.	 “-άζομαι”	 [ázome],	 “-ζομαι”.	 Which	 means	 that	 the	 closed	 form	 of,	
    ετοιμάζομαι,	 might	 be?	 So	 we	 don’t	 really	 need	 to	 find	 the	 instruction,	 we	 just	
    need	to	find	another	“-ζομαι”	verb.	So	we	can	think,	φαντάζομαι	...	?		
	
S:	 Φανταστώ	[fandastó].		


                                                                                             568
	
T:	 Good.	Ετοιμάζομαι?		
	
S:	 Ετοιμαστώ	[etimastó].		
	
T:	 I	will	get	ready.		
	
S:	 Θα	ετοιμαστώ.		
	
T:		Θα	ετοιμαστώ.	Will	you	get	ready	now?		
	
S:	 θα	ετοιμαστείς	τώρα;	[tha	etimastís	tóra?].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 θα	 ετοιμαστείς	 τώρα;	 Will	 you	 get	 ready	 now?	 And	 the	 order,	 “Get	
    ready!”	is,	ετοιμάσου	[etimásu].	Ετοιμάσου.		
	
S:	 Ετοιμάσου.		
	
T:	 But	not	for	“you”,	plural,	no?	If	you	tell	more	than	one	person	to	get	ready,	you	
    can	 just	 go	 from	 the	 closed	 form.	 So	 again,	 what	 is	 the	 closed	 form	 of,	
    ετοιμάζομαι?		
	
S:	 Ετοιμαστώ.		
	
T:		Ετοιμαστώ.	So	if	you	say,	Get	ready,	to	more	than	one	person,	or	to	one	person,	
    formally?		
	
S:	 Ετοιμαστείτε	[etimastíte].		
	
T:	 Ετοιμαστείτε.	 Good.	 So	 we	 have	 some	 odd	 forms	 popping	 up	 for	 the	 positive	
    order,	 no,	 when	 we	 tell	 somebody	 to	 do	 something,	 to	 one	 person,	 with	 these	
    “-ομαι”,	 “-άμαι”	 verbs.	 But	 we	 see	 that	 the	 orders	 also	 have	 a	 lot	 in	 common.	
    There	is	one	big	exception:	έρχομαι	[érkhome].	To	say,	Come!	from,	έρχομαι	–	“I	
    come”,	we	say:	έλα	[éla].	Έλα.		
	
S:	 Έλα.		
	
T:	 How	do	you	think	you	would	say	to	more	than	one	person,	Come!	You	will	go	from	
    έλα.	What	might	you	add	on	to	“έλα”	to	get,	Come!	to	more	than	one	person?		
	
S:	 “-τε”	[te].		
	
T:		Good.	So	how	would	it	sound?		
	
S:	 Eλάτε	[eláte].		
	
T:	 Ελάτε.	Good.	Ελάτε.	So	that’s	an	exception.		                                       	


                                                                                           569
Complete	Greek,	Track	117	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	Πλένω	[pléno]	in	Greek,	πλένω,	is	“I	wash”.	Πλένω.		
	
Student:	Πλένω.		
	
T:	 And,	πλένομαι	[plénome]	is	“I	wash	myself”	–	mostly	used	for	like,	to	wash	your	
    hands,	or	something,	but	you	might	hear	it	used,	like,	“to	bathe”.	Πλένομαι.		
	
S:	 Πλένομαι.		
	
T:	 So	 to	 find	 the	 closed	 version	 of,	 πλένομαι,	 we	 should	 try	 to	 find	 some	 “-νομαι”	
    somewhere	 and	 see	 what	 happens.	 So	 we	 had,	 χάνομαι	 [khánome],	 and	 what	
    happened	to	get	the	closed	form	of,	χάνομαι?		
	
S:	 Χαθώ	[khathó].		
	
T:	 Χαθώ.	Good.	So	what	might	Πλένομαι	become,	when	it’s	in	its	closed	form?		
	
S:	 Πλεθώ	[plethó].		
	
T:	 Good.	 That	 would	 be	 a	 good	 guess.	 No?	 Πλένομαι	 –	 πλεθώ.	 So,	 if	 you	 haven’t	
    heard	it	before,	you	would	try	that,	and	maybe	you	can	show	with	your	intonation	
    that	you’re	not	sure	about	it.	Πλεθώ	…	?	And	you	would	get	the	correction,	πλυθώ	
    [plithó],	πλυθώ,	and	you’d	think,	oh,	okay,	we	have	the	[th]	(θ)	there	deleting	the	
    N	(ν),	but	the	vowel	changes	a	little	bit	too.	Πλένομαι	–	πλυθώ.		
	
	 So,	“I	will	wash	myself”	or	like,	“I	will	wash	my	hands	(or	something)”.		
	
S:	 Θα	πλυθώ	[tha	plithó].		
	
T:	 Θα	 πλυθώ.	 So	 we	 don’t	 have	 to	 think	 of	 “myself”	 there,	 no?	 It’s	 included	 in	 the	
    verb.	Θα	πλυθώ,	from,	πλένομαι.	How	would	you	say,	I	washed	(I	washed	myself)?		
	
S:	 Πλύθηκα	[plíthika].		
	
T:	 Πλύθηκα.	Good,	no?	We	go	to	our	closed	form,	πλυθώ;	we	add	[ik]	(ηκ),	and	our	
    normal	ending	for	the	past	–	for	“I”,	[a]	(α);	πλύθηκα.	And	tell	me	again,	I	wash	
    myself,	in	the	present?		
	
S:	 Πλένομαι.		
	
T:	 Πλένομαι.	And,	I	was	washing	myself.		
	
S:	 Πλενούσα,	…	πλένουσα	[plenúsa,	plénusa].		
	
T:	 Where	do	you	look,	to	get	this,	our	open	past?		


                                                                                             570
	
S:	 To	“ήμουν”	[ímun].		
	
T:	 Good.	So	we	know	a	lot	of	Greek,	and	we	know	a	lot	of	endings.	And	if	you	don’t	
    want	to	just	pick	the	first	one	that	comes	into	your	head,	you	need	to	stop	and	go:	
    What	do	I	do?	I	wash	myself.	How	is	it?		
	
S:	 Πλένομαι.		
	
T:	 Πλένομαι.	 And	 there	 “-ομαι”	 is	 like	 “είμαι”,	 no?	 And	 if	 you	 want	 to	 say,	 I	 was	
    washing	myself,	instead	of	“-ομαι”	[ome],	like	“είμαι”,	we	will	have	something	like	
    “ήμουν”.		
	
S:	 Πλενόμουν	[plenómun].		
	
T:	 Πλενόμουν.	 Good.	 We	 accent	 the	 ending,	 no?	 “-όμουν”	 [ómun].	 Πλενόμουν,	 or	
    πλενόμουνα	[plenómunα],	like	“ήμουνα”,	which	we	know	also	exists.		
	
	 And	the	order,	“Wash!	(Wash	yourself!)”	is,	πλύσου	[plísu].	Πλύσου.	How	would	
    the	plural	order	be?		
	
S:	 Πλυθείτε	[plithíte].		
	
T:	 Πλυθείτε.	 Good.	 So	 sometimes	 this	 “-ομαι”	 verb,	 like	 in,	 πλένομαι	 –	 “I	 wash	
    myself”,	 is	 giving	 this	 meaning	 of	 “myself”	 or	 “yourself”.	 Πλένω	 –	 I	 wash;	 and	
    πλένομαι	–	I	wash	myself.	 But	other	times	in	Greek,	when	you	want	 to	give	this	
    meaning	of	“myself	(yourself)”,	you	will	use,	ο	εαυτός	σου	[o	eaftós	su]	–	ο	εαυτός	
    σου,	for	“yourself”.	Ο	εαυτός	σου.		
	
S:	 Ο	εαυτός	σου.		
	
T:	 So	this	is	again	like,	αυτό	[aftó],	like	“auto”,	no?	“Myself”	–	o	εαυτός	μου	[o	eaftós	
    mu].	But	it’s	not	a	word	like,	αυτος	(αυτη);	it’s	just	a	noun,	εαυτός,	meaning	“the	
    self”.	 And	 for	 this	 reason,	 it	 doesn’t	 go	 into	 the	 feminine,	 no?	 So	 if	 you	 say	
    “myself”,	and	you	are	a	female,	you	still	say,	ο	εαυτός	μου.		
	
	 What	was,	I	speak?		
	
S:	 Μιλαώ	[miláo].	
	
T:	 Μιλαώ.	So	if	you	want	to	say,	I	speak	to	myself,	I	speak	with	myself,	you	won’t	try	
    to	 build	 a	 “-ουμαι”,	 “-ομαι”,”-αμαι”	 verb	 out	 of	 “μιλαώ”.	 You	 will	 use,	 ο	 εαυτός	
    μου.	So	how	would	you	say	that?	I	speak	with	myself?		
	
S:	 Μιλαώ	με	τον	εαυτό	μου	[miláo	me	ton	eaftó	mu].		
	



                                                                                             571
T:	 Very	good.	Very	good.	Because	it’s	like	“with	me”,	rather	than	“with	I”,	no?	“With	
    him”,	rather	than	“with	he”.	Μιλαώ	με	τον	εαυτό	μου.	So	we	could	say	that.	We	
    could	also	say,	Μιλάω	μόνος	μου	[miláo	mónos	mu],	no?	“I	speak	on	my	own	(by	
    myself)”.	 And	 that	 would	 also	 be	 understood,	 “I	 speak	 to	 myself”,	 depending	 on	
    the	meaning	you	want	to	give.		
	
	 “I	draw”,	I	draw,	was	ζωγραφίζω	[zoghrafízo].	Zωγραφίζω	–	like,	ζω	[zo],	“life”	–	
    ζωή	 [zoí],	 like	 the	 name	 “Zoe”;	 and	 γράφω	 [ghráfo].	 But	 we	 get,	 ζωγραφίζω	 –	 I	
    draw.	How	would	you	say,	He	(or,	she)	draws?		
	
S:	 Ζωγραφίζει	[zoghrafízi].		
	
T:	 Ζωγραφίζει.	 He	 only	 draws	 himself.	 Again,	 you	 won’t	 try	 to	 make	 this	 verb	 like,	
    ζωγρσφίζεται.	No?	You	will	just	use,	ο	εαυτός.	So,	He	only	draws	himself.		
	
S:	 Μόνο	ζωγραφίζει	τον	εαυτό	του	[móno	zoghrafízi	ton	eaftó	tu].		
	
T:	 Very	 good.	 Μόνο	 ζωγραφίζει	 (ζωγραφίζει	 μόνο)	 τον	 εαυτό	 του.	 And	 if	 we	 were	
    saying,	She	draws	herself,	we	would	say,	τον	εαυτό	της	[ton	eaftó	tis],	because	as	
    we	mentioned,	ο	εαυτός,	is	just	a	masculine	noun	meaning,	“the	self”.		
	
	 He	hates	himself.	We	had,	μισώ	[misó],	like	in	“misogyny”.	He	hates	himself.		
	
S:	 Μισεί	τον	εαυτό	του	[misí	ton	eaftó	tu].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μισεί	τον	εαυτό	του.	And,	She	hates	herself?		
	
S:	 Μισεί	τον	εαυτό	της	[misí	ton	eaftó	tis].		
	
T:	 Μισεί	τον	εαυτό	της.	Very	good.		
	
	 So	we	see	that	sometimes	we	achieve	this	meaning	of	“myself/yourself”	with	one

Teacher:	How	would	you	say,	I	find?	How	is,	I	find,	in	Greek?		
	
Student:	Βρίσκω	[vrísko].		
	
T:	 Βρίσκω.	And,	I	don’t	find?		
	
S:	 Δεν	βρίσκω	[dhen	vrísko].		
	
T:	 Δεν	βρίσκω.	With	some	words,	like	“δεν”,	for	example,	you	may	hear	and	see	in	
    writing,	the	N	(ν)	of	“δεν”,	being	dropped	before	certain	sounds.	So,	for	example,	
    you	might	hear,	δε	βρίσκω	[dhe	vrísko].	Δε	βρίσκω.		
	
S:	 Δε	βρίσκω.		
	
T:	 And	you	can	also	see	this	written,	or	you	will	see	this	written.	This	is	because	[v]	
    (β)	is	a	soft	consonant.	And	when	we	have	soft	consonants,	we	can	drop	this	N	(ν)	
    of	“δεν”.	So,	δε	βρίσκω.		
	
	 A	T	(τ),	for	example,	a	[t],	is	a	hard	consonant.	So	if	you	say,	I	don’t	find	it,	then	you	
    won’t	drop	this	N	(ν)	of	“δεν”.	So	how	is	that?	I	can’t	find	it;	I	don’t	find	it.		
	
S:	 Δεν	το	βρίσκω	[dhen	to	vrísko].		
	
T:	 Δεν	το	βρίσκω.	
	
	 So	you	can	…	you	can	hear	and	see	this	change	with	a	few	words	like	“δεν”,	like	
    “μην”,	like	“την”,	or	“τον”.	But	it	has	nothing	to	do	with	meaning.	It’s	just	a	sound	
    change.	And	also	it’s	not	obligatory;	you	don’t	have	to	do	it.	It’s	not	incorrect	to	
    not	do	it.	And	also	a	lot	of	natives	do	it	in	different	ways,	depending	on	dialect	and	
    even	 idiolect.	 So,	 this	 isn’t	 something	 you	 need	 to	 worry	 about.	 But	 I	 wanted	 to	
    run	through	it,	especially	so	people	don’t	get	confused	when	they	see	“δε”	instead	
    of	“δεν”,	and	“τη”	instead	of	“την”,	or	“το”	instead	of	“τον”,	for	example.	So	we	
    see	that	V	(β)	is	a	soft	sound.	So,	for	example,	if	we	say,	I	don’t	find,	we	can	say,	Δε	
    βρίσκω.	How	would	you	say,	I	don’t	see?		
	
S:	 Δε	βλέπω	[dhe	blépo].		
	
T:	 Δε	 βλέπω.	 No?	 So	 it’s	 not	 wrong	 to	 say,	 δεν	 βλέπω,	 but	 you	 will	 hear	 often,	 δε	
    βλέπω,	and	see	it	written	as	well.	Δε	βλέπω.		
	
	 [m],	[ma]	–	an	M	sound	–	is	also	a	soft	consonant.	So	how	would	you	say,	Don’t	
    you	see	me?		
	
S:	 Δε	μου	βλέπεις;	[dhe	mu	vlépis?].		
	


                                                                                              573
T:	 Again.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	βλέπεις;		
	
T:	 Μου	[mu]?		
	
S:	 Δε	με	βλέπεις;	[dhe	me	vlépis?].		
	
T:	 Δε	με	βλέπεις;	So	you	could	lose	the	Ν	(ν)	there	as	well,	because	of	the	M	(μ).	Δε	
    με	βλέπεις;	Don’t	you	see	them?		
	
S:	 Δεν	τους	βλέπεις;	[dhen	tus	vlépis?].		
	
T:	 Good;	[t]	is	a	hard	consonant,	so	we	don’t	lose	the	N	(ν).	Δεν	τους	βλέπεις;		
	
	 So	 I	 said	 “την”	 and	 “τον”	 can	 also	 lose	their	N	(ν),	but	this	 is	mostly	 when	 “την”	
    and	 “τον”	 are	 behaving	 like	 “the”;	 although,	 like	 I	 said,	 you	 can	 hear	 people	
    breaking	this	rule.	So	if	you	say,	I	find	it,	and	you	mean	a	masculine	thing?		
	
S:	 Τον	βρίσκω	[ton	vrísko].		
	
T:	 Τον	βρίσκω.	You	don’t	lose	the	N	(ν)	of	“τον”	when	it’s	like	“it”	or	like	“him”.	But	
    when	“τον”	is	like	“the”,	we	can	lose	the	N	(ν).	So,	ο	λόγος	[o	lóghos],	ο	λόγος,	like	
    in	“psychology”,	“biology”.	O	λόγος,	is	“the	reason”.	Ο	λόγος.		
	
S:	 Ο	λόγος.		
	
T:	 If	you	say,	I	don’t	find	the	reason,	this	is	like	“I	don’t	figure	it	out”,	“I	can’t	figure	it	
    out”.	 I	 don’t	 find	 the	 reason.	 So	 how	 would	 that	 be?	 I	 can’t	 figure	 it	 out	 (I	 don’t	
    find).	And	we	have,	ο	λόγος.		
	
S:	 Δεν	βρίσκω	τον	λόγος.	Τον	…	τον	λόγο	[dhen	vrísko	ton	lóghos	…	ton	…	ton	lógho].		
	
T:	 Δεν	βρίσκω	(or,	δε	βρίσκω)	τον	λόγο.	And	I	can	tell	you	that		[l]	(λ)	is	also	a	soft	
    sound,	so	we	could	lose	the	N	(ν)	of	“τον”	in,	τον	λόγο.	So	how	would	that	be?	I	
    don’t	find	the	reason.	I	don’t	figure	it	out.		
	
S:	 Δεν	βρίσκω	το	λόγο	[dhen	vrísko	to	lógho].		
	
T:	 Δεν	βρίσκω	(or,	δε	βρίσκω)	το	λόγο.	Good.	So	when	“τον”	or	“την”	is	behaving	like	
    “the”,	it’s	especially	common	to	lose	the	N	(ν)	if	it’s	followed	by	a	soft	sound.	The	
    past	of,	βρίσκω	was,	βρήκα	[vríka].	Βρήκα.		
	
S:	 Βρήκα.		
	
T:	 Like	“Eureka”	in	English.	Βρήκα.	So,	I	figured	it	out;	I	found	the	reason.		
	


                                                                                                   574
S:	 Βρήκα	το	λόγο	[vríka	to	lógho].		
	
T:	 Βρήκα	το	λόγο.	So	we	could	have,	τον	λόγο,	or,	το	λόγο.	Τον	λόγο	isn’t	a	mistake;	
    it’s	not	obligatory	to	move	this	Ν	(ν).	So	you	can	just	be	safe	and	leave	all	your	N’s	
    everywhere.	Βρήκα	τον	λόγο.	Δεν	βρήκα	τον	λόγο.	But,	you	know,	if	you	want	to	
    sound	more	native	and	more	fluent,	you	can	listen	out	to	when	this	happens,	you	
    know,	and	incorporate	it	into	your	speech.	Δε	βρήκα	το	λόγο	[dhe	vríka	to	lógho].		
	
	 So,	 so	 far	 we’ve	 seen	 that	 [v]	 (β),	 [l]	 (λ),	 [m]	 (μ)	 are	 soft	 sounds,	 or	 soft	
    consonants,	to	be	more	precise,	because	we	never	lose	the	N	(ν)	before	a	vowel.		
	
	 How	was,	the	brother?		
	
S:	 Ο	αδελφός	[o	adhelfós].		
	
T:	 Ο	αδελφός.	So	how	would	you	say,	We	found	our	brother?	We	found	our	brother.		
	
S:	 Βρήκαμε	τον	αδελφό	μας	[vríkame	ton	adhelfó	mas].		
	
T:	 Βρήκαμε	τον	αδελφό	μας.	Very	good.	So	we	don’t	have	the	option	to	lose	the	N	
    (ν)	on	“τον”,	because	“αδελφό”	starts	with	a	vowel.	Βρήκαμε	τον	αδελφό	μας.		
	
	 How	would	you	say,	I	don’t	buy?		
	
S:	 Δεν	αγοράζω	[dhen	aghorázo].		
	
T:	 Δεν	αγοράζω.	So	again,	we	can’t	lose	the	N	(ν)	of	“δεν”,	because	“αγοράζω”	starts	
    with	a	vowel.	Δεν	αγοράζω.	How	would	you	say,	He	didn’t	buy	me	anything?	He	
    didn’t	buy	me	anything.	He	didn’t	buy	me	nothing.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	αγόρασε	τίποτα	[dhen	mu	aghórase	típota].		
	
T:	 Good.	Δεν	μου	αγόρασε	τίποτα.	Αnd	we	could	also	have,	Δε	μου	αγόρασε	τίποτα	
    [dhe	mu	aghórase	típota],	because	here	we	have,	μου	[mu],	no?	And	the	M	(μ)	is	
    soft.	 Δε	 μου	 αγόρασε	 τίποτα.	 And	 like	 as	 I	 mentioned,	 this	 isn’t	 just	 a	 spoken	
    phenomenon.	You	will	find	also	these	N’s	left	off	in	writing,	too.		
	
	 So	before,	we	wanted	to	focus	on	how	words	are	changing	for	their	meaning,	no?	
    O	λόγος	–	τον	λόγο.	But	apart	from	that,	you	can	also	hear	these	phonetic	changes	
    and	find,	το	λόγο.	That	doesn’t	mean	you	have	a	neuter	word	of	course.	And	like	I	
    said,	it	doesn’t	matter	if	you	don’t	do	this;	it’s	not	a	mistake	to	not	remove	N’s.	
    But	it	can	sound	like	a	mistake	to	remove	an	N	where	you	shouldn’t.	So	you	can	
    stay	safe	and	keep	your	N’s,	until	you’re	sure	on	when	to	let	them	go.	And	you	can	
    learn	about	when	you	should	remove	these	N’s,	just	by	listening.	If	you	know	that,	
    ο	λόγος,	is	masculine	and	you	hear,	το	λόγο,	then	you	can	think,	okay,	before	the	L	
    (λ),	we	remove	that	N	(ν).		
	


                                                                                            575
	 What	was,	I	remember?		
	
S:	 Θυμάμαι	[thimáme].		
	
T:	 Θυμάμαι.	TH	[th]	(Θ/θ)	is	a	soft	sound.	So	if	you	say,	I	don’t	remember.		
	
S:	 Δε	θυμάμαι	[dhe	thimáme].		
	
T:	 Δε	θυμάμαι.	I	won’t	remember.	I	will	not	remember.		
	
S:	 Δε	θα	θυμάμαι	[dhe	tha	thimáme].		
	
T:	 Δε	θα	θυμάμαι.	Or,	δε	θα	θυμηθώ	[dhe	tha	thimithó],	depending	on	the	context.	I	
    don’t	want.		
	
S:	 Δε	θέλω	[dhe	thélo].		
	
T:	 Δε	θέλω.	So	again,	especially	with	common	expressions	like,	δε	θέλω,	δε	θυμάμαι,	
    you’re	really	likely	to	notice	that	N	(ν)	missing,	which	can	remind	you	that	you	can	
    let	these	N’s	go	before	TH	(θ).	But	like	I	said,	this	is	just	the	ends	of	“δεν,	μην,	τον”	
    and	“την”;	and	also	those	other	words	that	behave	like	“the”,	no?	“Αυτόν,	αυτήν,	
    άλλον,	έναν”.		
	
	 I	leave.	What	was,	I	leave,	like,	you	know,	“I	leave	from	a	place”?		
	
S:	 Φεύγω	[févgho].		
	
T:	 Φεύγω.	And	the	[f]	(φ)	is	also	soft.	So,	I	don’t	leave;	I’m	not	leaving.		
	
S:	 Δε	φεύγω	[dhe	févgho].		
	
T:	 Δε	φεύγω.	And	the	closed	version	of,	φεύγω?		
	
S:	 Φύγω	[fígho].		
	
T:	 Φύγω.	 So	 I	 said	 that	 “μην”	 can	 also	 lose	 its	 N	 (ν).	 So	 how	 might	 you	 say,	 Don’t	
    leave?		
	
S:	 Μη	φύγεις	[mi	fíyis].		
	
T:	 Μη	φύγεις.	And	what	was,	I	leave,	in	the	sense	of	“I	leave	something”?		
	
S:	 Αφήνω	[afíno].		
	
T:	 Αφήνω.	And	the	closed	form?		
	
S:	 Αφήσω	[afíso].		


                                                                                                576
	
T:	 Αφήσω.	Αφήνω	starts	with	a	vowel,	no?	Αφήνω,	αφήσω	–	we	have	a	vowel	there,	
    and	we	can’t	lose	our	N’s	(ν)	before	vowels.	So,	Don’t	leave	anything.	How	would	
    that	be?	Don’t	leave	anything!		
	
S:	 Μην	αφήσεις	τίποτα	[min	afísis	típota].		
	
T:	 Μην	αφήσεις	τίποτα.	Very	good.	And,	Don’t	leave	it.		
	
S:	 Μην	το	αφήσεις	[min	to	afísis].		
	
T:	 Μην	το	αφήσεις.	No?	“Το”	and	T	–	still	a	hard	sound.	Μην	το	αφήσεις.		Don’t	 leave	
    it	to	us!	Don’t	leave	us	it!		
	
S:	 Μην	μας	το	αφήσεις	[min	mas	to	afísis].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Μην	μας	το	αφήσεις.	And	also,	apart	from	“μην”,	we	could	have?		
	
S:	 Μη	[mi].		
	
T:	 Why?		
	
S:	 Because	the	M	(μ)	is	a	soft	...		
	
T:	 Good.	We	have	“μας”	there.	Great.	Μη	μας	το	αφήσεις	[mi	mas	to	afísis].	Good.	
    You	can	also	say	“μην”	by	itself,	like	“No!”	or	“Don’t!”	But	when	you	do	say	“μην”	
    by	itself,	it	also	loses	the	N	(ν).	So,	μη	[mi].	Μη!		
	
S:	 Μη!		
	
T:	 So	if	you	hear	“Μη!”,	it’s	like	“No!”,	“Don’t!”.	[p]	(Π/π)	is	also	a	hard	consonant.	So	
    how	would	you	say,	I	don’t	play?		
	
S:	 Δεν	παίζω	[dhen	pézo].		
	
T:	 Δεν	παίζω.	Don’t	play!		
	
S:	 Μην	παίζεις	[min	pézis].		
	
T:	 Μην	παίζεις.	Μην	παίξεις	[min	péksis],	depending	on	the	context,	no?		
	
	 How	was,	I	understand?		
	
S:	 Καταλαβαίνω	[katalavéno].		
	
T:		Καταλαβαίνω.	 And	 here	 we	 have	 a	 hard	 consonant,	 a	 [k]	 (κ).	 So,	 I	 don’t	
    understand.		


                                                                                       577
	
S:	 Δεν	καταλαβαίνω	[dhen	katalavéno].		
	
T:	 Δεν	καταλαβαίνω.		
	
	 Also,	 noticing	 what	 is	 a	 soft	 and	 a	 hard	 consonant,	 can	 also	 help	 you	 with	 other	
    sound	issues	in	Greek.	For	example,	we	saw	that	the	AU	(αυ)	and	the	EU	(ευ)	in	
    Greek,	gives	us	either	[av]	or	[af],	either	[ev]	or	[ef].	We	can	expect	an	[av]	or	[ev]	
    before	soft	consonants:	like,	ευρό	[evró]	–	Euro;	like,	Ευριπίδης	[evripídhis]	–	the	
    name	(Euripides);	like,	αύριο	[ávrio]	–	tomorrow.	And	[af]	and	[ef],	we	can	expect	
    before	 harder	 consonants:	 like	 in,	 αυτό,	 αυτός	 [aftó,	 aftós];	 like	 in,	 ευκάλυπτος	
    [efkáliptos]	–	eucalyptus.	Ευκάλυπτος.	So	this	issue	about	dropping	N’s	(ν)	will	also	
    raise	our	consciousness	about	hard	and	soft	sounds,	which	we	may	find	useful	for	
    other	bits	and	pieces	in	Greek,	too.		
	
	                                 	




                                                                                             578

Teacher:	What	was	the	word	for,	and?		
	
Student:	Και	[ke].		
	
T:	 Και.	 You	 can	 also	 find	 “κι”	 [ki]	 for	 “and”	 as	 well,	 like	 before	 vowels.	 Και	 or	 κι	 –	
    “and”,	is	used	in	quite	a	few	expressions	in	Greek;	it’s	used	quite	creatively	as	a	
    word.	 For	 example,	 we’ve	 seen	 it	 in,	 και	 άλλο	 [ke	 álo]	 –	 “and	 other”,	 meaning	
    “more”.	Θέλεις	και	άλλο;	–	Do	you	want	more?	We’ve	seen	it	as	“also”:	Θέλω	και	
    εγώ	[thélo	ke	eghó]	–	I	also	want,	or,	κι	εγώ	[ki	eghó].		
	
	 And	 we	 can	 combine	 “και”	 in	 quite	 a	 few	 ways	 to	 get	 different	 meanings.	 We	
    already	saw,	very	briefly,	και	έτσι	[ke	étsi]	–	meaning	“so”,	like	“and	so”,	και	έτσι.	
    Now	we	know	that	could	also	be,	κι	έτσι	[ki	étsi];	έτσι	was	“like	this”.	And,	“and	
    like	 this”	 –	 “so”,	 “therefore”,	 in	 a	 sentence	 like,	 I	 didn’t	 like	 it	 so	 I	 left.	 So	 how	
    would	that	be?	I	didn’t	like	it	so	I	left.		
	
S:	 Δεν	μου	άρεσε	και	έτσι	έφυγα	[dhen	mu	árese	ke	étsi	éfigha].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Δεν	μου	άρεσε	και	έτσι	έφυγα.	We	could	say,	Έτσι	και	έτσι	[étsi	ke	étsi]	
    as	well,	again	combining	with	“έτσι”	which	means	“like	this”.	Έτσι	και	έτσι,	means	
    “So-so”.	Έτσι	και	έτσι,	or,	έτσι	κι	έτσι	[étsi	ki	étsi].		
	
S:	 Έτσι	κι	έτσι.		
	
T:	 How	are	you?	So-so.	How	did	it	go?	So-so.		
	
	 But	we	can	use	“και”	in	all	kinds	of	colourful	ways.	For	example,	we	could	have,	Αν	
    και	[an	ke]	–	“if	and”.	Αν	και	–	“if	and”,	like	“even	though”.	Αν	και.		
	
S:	 Αν	και.		
	
T:	 Αν	και.	So	you	could	say,	you	know,	Even	though	I’m	very	tired	I	will	come.	How	
    might	that	be?	Even	though	I’m	very	tired,	I	will	come.		
	
S:	 Αν	και	είμαι	πολύ	κουράσμενος	θα	έρθω	[an	ke	íme	polí	kurazménos	tha	értho].		
	
T:	 Very	good.	Αν	και	(αν	κι)	είμαι	πολύ	κουρασμένος	θα	έρθω.		
	
	 The	word	for	“sick”	is,	άρρωστος	[árostos].	Άρρωστος,	in	the	masculine.		
	
S:	 Άρρωστος.		
	
T:	 Even	though	I	was	unwell	(I	was	sick)	 I	went	to	work.	Give	me	the	first	 bit,	Even

T:	 Very	good.	Αν	και	ήμουν	άρρωστος	πήγα	στην	δουλειά	[an	ke	ímun	árostos	pígha	
    stin	 dhuliá].	 Or	 we	 could	 also	 have,	 στη	 δουλειά	 [sti	 dhuliá],	 as	 [dh]	 (δ)	 is	 a	 soft	
    consonant.	 Αν	 και	 ήμουν	 άρρωστος	 (or,	 άρρωστη,	 for	 feminine)	 πήγα	 στη	
    δουλειά.		
	
	 So,	και,	other	than	“and”,	might	also	be	carrying	meaning	from	the	Latin,	que	[ke],	
    like	in	Spanish	or	Italian	that	you	have,	que,	which	means	like	“that”.	It	would	be	a	
    huge	 coincidence	 that	 “αν	 και”	 in	 Spanish	 is,	 aunque.	 And	 it	 means	 exactly	 the	
    same	 thing	 –	 “even	 though”.	 So	 you	 may	 find	 some	 odd	 colourful	 and	 creative	
    uses	 of	 “and”,	 and	 maybe	 you	 need	 to	 zoom	 out	 a	 little	 in	 the	 sentence	 to	
    understand	its	meaning,	by	the	wider	context.		
	
	 To	exemplify	also	how	flexible	this	“και”	is	in	different	sayings,	both	“και	έτσι”	and	
    “αν	και”,	if	we	say	…	if	we	turn	them	around,	and	we	say	“έτσι	και”,”και	αν”	or	“κι	
    αν”	we	have	completely	different	meanings.	Έτσι	και	[étsi	ke]	can	be	used	like	a,	
    like	a	warning,	for	example,	you	know.	Έτσι	και	...	Ι	will	come	and	find	you,	if	you	
    do	that,	you	know.	Something	like	this	–	like	a	warning.	And	…	and	of	course	we	
    saw,	και	έτσι,	as	like,	“and	so”	and	“therefore”.		
	
	 We	 saw	 “αν	 και”	 as	 “although”,	 “even	 though”;	 and	 then	 “και	 αν”	 or	 “κι	 αν”	
    means	“what	if”.	Τι	κι	αν	[ti	ki	an]	means	“so	what”.	Τι	κι	αν.	But	like	I	said,	“και”	is	
    really	used	a	lot	in	Greek.		
	
	 Some	more	examples:	Και	αυτό	και	εκείνο	[ke	aftó	ke	ekíno]	–	“both	this	and	that”	
    (and	this	and	that).	If	you	want	to	say,	Both	this	and	that	–	και	αυτό	και	εκείνο.		
	
	 You	can	use	it	in	other	ways	to	emphasise.	For	example,	you	know,	if	you	want	to	
    say	“I	can	both	sing	and	dance”	–	Και	τραγουδάω	και	χορεύω	[ke	traghudháo	kai	
    khorévo]	 –	 And	 I	 sing	 and	 I	 dance,	 meaning,	 “I	 can	 both	 sing	 and	 dance”.	 Και	
    τραγουδάω	και	χορεύω.	Like,	“I’m	not	just	a	singer”,	for	example.		
	
	 You	 might	 hear,	 Και	 τρώς	 και	 πίνεις.	 Και	 τρώς	 και	 πινείς	 –	 And	 you	 eat	 and	 you	
    drink.	This	is	a	saying,	meaning	like,	you	know,	“You	are	doing	two	things	at	once	
    when	you	shouldn’t	be”.	Και	τρώς	και	πίνεις	–	You	eat	and	drink	at	once.

Complete	Greek,	Track	120	–	Language	Transfer		
	
Teacher:	So	I	could	go	on	and	on,	telling	you	more	and	more	about	Greek,	but	I	really	
  don’t	 need	 to	 at	 this	 stage.	 You	 now	 have	 all	 the	 knowledge	 and	 tools	 and	
  perspective	 of	 language	 to	 broaden	 and	 fine-tune	 your	 Greek	 through	 practice,	
  exposure,	and	analysis;	or	thought,	let’s	say.		
	
	 You	can	look	at	words	you	don’t	know	and	work	out,	either	just	by	the	word,	or	
  the	larger	context,	what	kind	of	word	it	is,	and	how	it’s	built,	or	what	it’s	built	of,	
  and	 how	 it’s	 behaving.	 You	 can	 look	at	 unfamiliar	 structures,	and	 with	 what	 you	
  know	about	Greek,	and	how	to	think	about	Greek,	work	out	what’s	going	on.		
	
	 We’ve	learnt	not	to	shut	down	when	we	come	across	something	unfamiliar,	but	to	
  begin	 with	 what	 is	 familiar,	 and	 in	 this	 way	 revise	 what	 we	 do	 know,	 until	 it	
  becomes	second	nature.	And	when	it	does,	Greek	will	slow	right	down	to	your	ear,	
  and	 you	 will	 find	 yourself	 with	 more	 mental	 time	 or	 space	 to	 analyse	 and	
  incorporate	 the	 Greek	 you	 come	 across	 –	 be	 it	 vocabulary,	 or	 variations	 of	
  structure,	to	achieve	different	meanings.		
	
	 Learning	in	this	conscious,	analytical	and	curious	way,	we	are	very	conscious	of	our	
  Greek.	 We	 get	 an	 intimate	 relationship	 with	 the	 language	 that	 most	 native	
  speakers	 don’t	 have	 in	 their	 language.	 But	 nevertheless,	 we	 may	 be	 able	 to	 say	
  much	more	than	what	we	can	understand	at	the	beginning.	And	this	is	normal,	as	
  listening	 is	 a	 separate	 skill,	 but	 one	 that	 will	 quickly	 improve,	 so	 long	 as	 you	
  concentrate	on	picking	out	what	you	can	identify,	instead	of	panicking	about	what	
  you	 don’t.	 Relax,	 see	 what	 you	 recognise,	 and	 the	 more	 you	 do	 that,	 the	 more	
  Greek	will	slow	down	to	your	ear.	Listening	is	extremely	important.	You	need	to	
  see	the	world	of	Greek	as	a	constant	source	of	clarification	and	expansion	for	your	
  Greek.		
	
	 A	great	way	to	practice	is	to	find	a	Greek	speaker	who	wants	to	learn	a	language	
  you	speak,	like	English,	for	example.	You	can	decide	to	mix	the	languages,	moving	
  in	and	out	of	Greek	and	English,	or	Spanish,	or	Arabic	for	example,	and	when	you	
  have	a	thought	or	say	something	that	you	realise	you	can	express	in	Greek,	then	
  you	 can	 switch	 to	 Greek.	 When	 you	 can’t,	 in	 order	 to	 keep	 the	 conversation	
  flowing,	you	can	move	back	to	English,	or	whatever	language	you’re	sharing.	And	
  if	it’s	something	you	feel	is	important,	and	you	really	want	to	know	how	to	say	it,	
  you	can	ask	–	rather	than	asking	how	to	say	everything,	you	know.	The	important	
  thing	is	to	keep	the	flow,	and	that’s	why	mixing	is	a	great	way	to	practice.	And	you	
  can	slowly	move	to	speaking	more	and	more	Greek	through	mixing	languages.		
	
	 In	this	way	you	also	get	to	prioritise	what	are	the	most	important	things	for	you	to	
  learn,	for	now.	For	example,	the	verb	“to	swim”,	might	be	more	important	to	you	
  than	“to	saw”,	unless	you	are	a	carpenter	of	course.	So	prioritise;	you	don’t	have	
  to	 learn	 everything	 at	 once.	 You	 can	 pick	 out	 what	 feels	 more	 important	 to	 you	
  right	 now.	 And	 when	 something	 feels	 important	 to	 you,	 you	 just	 learn	 it	 much	
  more	easily.

	 If	you	live	in	a	city,	you	can	find	a	language	exchange	to	practice	your	Greek.	And	
  of	course	you	can	also	find	people	to	practice	online.	And	practicing	doesn’t	just	
  mean	 speaking	 with	 people;	 it	 also	 means	 consuming	 culture,	 music,	 movies,	
  literature.	Enjoy	your	new	language.	Watch	cinema	with	sub-titles	in	English,	and	
  enjoy	 the	 movie.	 Relax,	 and	 see	 what	 you	 can	 pick	 out.	 Maybe	 you	 learn	 some	
  new	 words;	 maybe	 you	 just	 recognise	 things	 you	 know	 already;	 maybe	 you	 find	
  the	closed,	or	an	open,	form	of	a	verb	in	an	interesting	place	that	makes	you	think.	
  And	all	the	while,	you	are	training	you	ear	to	Greek,	enjoying	your	new	language,	
  thinking	 about	 it,	 analysing	 it,	 and	 you	 will	 be	 constantly	 studying	 without	 even	
  realising	it.		
	
	 You	can	also	find	bilingual	books	in	Greek,	and	Language	Transfer	hopes	to	release	
  original	 short	 stories	 by	 budding	 writers	 in	 Greek,	 with	 elaborated	 translations	
  into	English.	This	will	be	a	voted	publication,	so	you	can	vote	for	that,	if	it’s	not	out	
  when	you	hear	this	message.	And	there’s	also	a	voted	publication	for	reading	and	
  writing	in	Greek	script.	You	can	find	more	information	on	this	on	the	support	tab	
  on	the	website	–	support	tab:	Voting	Campaign.		
	
	 Speaking	of	which,	there	is	also	an	option	to	vote	for	further	Greek	audio	material,	
  in	 the	 way	 of	 a	 Cypriot	 Greek	 conversion	 course.	 Now	 the	 Cypriot	 dialect	 is	 a	
  fascinating	 and	 colourful	 mix	 of	 archaic	 Greek	 habits	 and	 the	 influence	 of	 other	
  languages,	such	as	Turkish	and	Arabic.	So	the	Greek	Cypriot	conversion	will	be	a	
  fascinating	historical	journey	through	the	Cypriot	Greek	dialect,	and	help	anyone	
  speak	like	and	understand,	not	only	the	island	natives,	but	the	Diaspora	–	like	the	
  many	 Cypriot	 Greek	 speakers	 there	 are	 in	 London,	 for	 example,	 who	 generally	
  have	very	little	to	no	command	of	standard	Greek,	like	I	didn’t,	until	I	made	this	
  course.	 So	 again,	 if	 you	 want	 to	 see	 this	 awesome	 material	 come	 to	 light,	 then	
  please	 support	 through	 making	 an	 occasional	 donation	 or	 joining	 the	 monthly	
  campaign,	and	voting.		
	
	 You	may	even	want	to	write	in	your	new	language,	trying	your	hand	at	poetry	or	
  short	stories,	and	getting	a	friend	to	check	it	for	you.	All	of	this	exposure,	practice,	
  and	 thought,	 is	 great	 for	 solidifying	 what	 you	 know,	 and	 just	 as	 importantly,	
  becoming	 aware	 of	 your	 grey	 areas	 and	 actively	 dealing	 with	 them,	 actively	
  clarifying	 them.	 In	 this	 way	 you	 will	 control	 the	 language,	 rather	 than	 feeling	
  controlled	or	limited	by	it.		
	
	 After	a	period	of	using	the	language,	you	may	want	to	repeat	this	course	from	the	
  beginning.	This	is	a	great	way	to	solidify	any	doubts,	but	also,	when	you	go	over	
  the	parts	of	the	course	you	are	clear	on,	you	will	often	find	yourself	taking	on	a	
  new	focus	and	processing	the	finer	points.		
	
	 As	I’ve	mentioned,	you	may	hear	various	alternative	forms	of	what	we’ve	learnt,	in	
  different	 dialects.	 In	 Greece,	 for	 example,	 we’ve	 seen,	 περπατούσα	 for,	 I	 was	
  walking.	In	the	south	of	Greece,	you	may	hear,	περπάταγα.	Περπάταγα.	So,	“άγ“	
  [ágh],	instead	of	“ούς”	[ús].	So	you	may	find	slight	differences	in	different	areas	of	


                                                                                           582
   Greece,	or	speaking	with	different	Greek	speakers.	And	if	you’re	living	in	Greece,	
   or	have	friends	from	a	particular	part	of	Greece,	then	you	can	pick	up	their	dialect,	
   if	you	like.	The	more	you	speak	like	the	Greek	that	you	are	hearing,	the	more	you	
   will	understand	and	pick	up.		
	
	 Thank	 you	 very	 much	 for	 participating	 in	 the	 Language	 Transfer	 project,	 just	 by	
  doing	this	course	and	becoming	a	Greek	speaker.	Please	share	the	project	far	and	
  wide,	 as	 much	 as	 you	 can,	 and	 help	 more	 people	 enjoy	 whatever	 benefits	 the	
  experience	 of	 a	 Language	 Transfer	 course	 might	 bring	 them,	 or	 might	 bring	 our	
  societies,	or	society	as	a	whole.		
	
	 Learning	 a	 language	 in	 the	 way	 we	 do,	 blurs	 the	 lines	 of	 the	 often	 homogenous	
  and	 divisive	 identities	 we	 are	 taught	 to	 have.	 As	 a	 Cypriot,	 I’m	 used	 to	 this,	 in	
  being	asked	constantly	if	I’m	Greek	or	Turkish	–	and	occasionally,	being	told	that	
  my	 blood	 is	 Greek,	 and	 I	 should	 stop	 all	 this	 silly	 Turk-hugging	 in	 regards	 to	 my	
  work	 in	 Cyprus	 and	 also	 Language	 Transfer.	 I	 enjoy	 replying,	 pulling	 out	 the	
  Turkish	words,	pronunciations,	or	habits,	that	were	used	to	tell	me	this	sentence	
  in	 Cypriot	 Greek,	 and	 reply	 that	 our	 blood	 would	 be	 something	 like	 our	 tongue.	
  And	this	for	me	is	a	huge	motivation	in	the	Language	Transfer	project.	We	really	
  are	each	other,	and	it	is	constantly	on	the	tip	of	our	tongues,	and	in	our	ideas,	our	
  beliefs,	in	our	technologies,	as	well	as	in	our	blood.		
	
	 As	you	probably	know	by	now,	Language	Transfer	is	a	completely	independent	and	
  unfunded	 project	 –	 or	 rather,	 it’s	 funded	 by	 you.	 So	 if	 you	 love	 the	 product	 and	
  the	 ethos	 of	 the	 project,	 then	 please	 check	 out	 the	 support	 tab	 on	 the	 website,	
  languagetransfer.org,	 where	 you	 can	 donate,	 vote,	 and	 also	 volunteer,	 to	 help	
  create	courses.		
	
	 Language	Transfer	is	currently	in	a	phase	of	expansion,	where	my	focus	is	shifting	
  to	teaching	more	people	to	create	courses,	rather	than	me	creating	them	all	–	to	
  then	 invest	 my	 energy	 in	 expanding	 the	 project	 in	 other	 ways.	 So	 again,	 if	 you	
  want	 to	 help	 that	 happen,	 if	 you	 want	 to	 help	 get	 this	 incredible	 product	 out	 to	
  more	people,	and	to	create	more,	then	please	donate	or	volunteer.	And	share.		
	
	 Language	Transfer	has	very	little	funds	for	dissemination,	so	we	really	do	rely	on	
  users	 to	 share	 the	 project	 far	 and	 wide,	 sharing	 their	 own	 personal	 experience.	
  You	can	also	get	yourself	a	dissemination	pack	to	share	the	project.	Check	that	out	
  on	the	support	tab,	again	on	the	website.	On	donation	packs	there	are	some	really	
  fun	and	great	packs	there	to	help	you	share	Language	Transfer;	and	the	“price”	(in	
  inverted	commas)	just	covers	the	cost	of	printing	these	products	and	getting	them	
  out	to	you.	So	it	really	is	just	a	collaboration	that	helps	you	share	this	project.		
	
	 Again,	thanks	for	forming	part	of	this	collective	experience.	It’s	been	a	pleasure	to	
  be	able	to	reach	out	and	share	this	experience	with	so	many	of	you.	And	I	hope	to	
  see	you	around.		
	
	 Enjoy	your	Greek.
